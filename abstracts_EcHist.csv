"Barsky, Robert B.; Long, J. Bradford de";The bull and bear markets of this century have suggested that large stock market swings reflect irrational “fads and fashions.” We argue instead that investors perceived shifts in the long-run rate of future growth and that stock prices are sufficiently sensitive to expectations about the future that these perceived shifts plausibly generated the swings of the twentieth century. We document that analysts often viewed as “smart money” assessed fundamentals, based on their perceptions of future economic growth, in a way that tracked decade-to-decade swings closely;1990;Bull and Bear Markets in the Twentieth Century;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Crafts, Nicolas F. R.; Leybourne, S.J; Mills, Terence C.";The paper uses a structural time series model to reconsider growth in industrial output in 19th-century Europe. The approach is based on an unobserved components methodology in which there is no ex-ante specification of dates at which the trend is hypothesized to have changed and both trend and cycle are stochastic. We find that trend growth was variable over time in several cases but in general was less volatile than has been claimed and also that in general these times series of industrial output are difference rather than trend stationary.;1990;Measurement of trend growth in European industrial output before 1914: Methodological issues and new estimates;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Dudley, Leonard;Previous explanations of Rome's decline fail to explain the frequency of civil war and the continued survival of the Byzantine empire. This paper demonstrates that symptoms similar to those observed in the Mediterranean region over the first millennium A.D. can result from a permanent shock to a system of interdependent bureaucracies. A decrease in military scale economies will lead to a contraction of territorial boundaries and an increase in tax levels. Historical evidence suggests that in the case of Rome, the shock took the form of a series of improvements in cavalry combat.;1990;Structural change in interdependent bureaucracies: Was Rome's failure economic or military?;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Economopoulos, Andrew J.;Rolnick and Weber found that a sharp decline in asset prices led to bank panics and, ultimately, bank failures during the free banking era. An examination of New York and Wisconsin free bank portfolios prior to a fall in asset prices indicates banks that weathered the turmoil held significantly different portfolios than closed banks. In general, solvent banks held more loans and specie, and issued more deposits and less bank notes than closed banks.;1990;Free bank failures in New York and Wisconsin: A portfolio analysis;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Gemery, H. A.; Hogendorn, Jan; Johnson, Marion";Newly available data from the English customs records on England's trade with Africa in the 18th century, when combined with data on Africa's slave exports, allow for the construction of a terms of trade series. England's terms of trade with Africa are found to have risen from the beginning of the century to 1720, fallen sharply in the 1720s, behaved in mixed fashion in the 1730s and 1740s, and thereafter fallen steadily and deeply to a figure about one-third that of the start of the century in the decade 1771–1780. A rise followed, until in 1800 a figure about one-half that at the beginning of the century had been achieved.;1990;Evidence on English/African terms of trade in the eighteenth century;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Gemmell, Norman; Wardley, Peter";"This paper compares evidence on productivity levels and growth, and factor intensities in manufacturing and service sectors—mainly transportation and distribution—in Britain, during 1856–1913. It is argued that (i) productivity levels in those services exceeded those in manufacturing; (ii) conclusions on relative sectoral productivity growth depend on whether a labor or total factor measure is used; and (iii) capital-labor ratios appear high in the services examined (relative to manufacturing) but conclusions on intrinsic factor intensity based on capital-labor ratios may be misleading.";1990;The contribution of services to British economic growth, 1856–1913;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Inikori, Joseph E.;The paper is premised on the fact that credit institutions made important contributions to the growth of output in manufacturing and commerce in the decades preceding, and during, the Industrial Revolution. It is argued that the development of the credit economy depended on the size of the market for credit transactions in England. Before the second half of the 17th century, that market was not large enough to justify the establishment of credit institutions. The growth of the slave-based Atlantic system in the 17th and 18th centuries (with its peculiar financial requirements), the capture by the British of a predominant share of the trade and commodity production connected with the system after 1660, and the financial needs of the British state arising from the military struggles by which this share was wrested from European rivals, all expanded the market for credit several times over, while at the same time providing much of the funds for the establishment of credit institutions.;1990;The credit needs of the African trade and the development of the credit economy in England;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Katz, Yossi; Neuman, Shoshana";The paper presents a historical and quantitative analysis of agricultural land transactions between Jews (buyers) and Arabs (sellers) in Palestine at the beginning of the century. Based on data relating to 104 plots (drawn from the archives of the Jewish settlement associations and organizations) and using the hedonic prices approach, it is found that site, relative location, and period of sale explain two-thirds of the variance in price. In addition, the nature of ownership, location in proximity to lands under Jewish ownership, and geopolitical region have substantial effects as well. The last factor is particularly interesting as it relates to nationalistic considerations of land redemption and preparation of a base for a national homeland.;1990;Agricultural land transactions in Palestine, 1900–1914: A quantitative analysis;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
MacKinnon, Mary;This paper studies unemployment relief in Canada by examining relief policies and recipients and contrasting the Canadian situation with unemployment insurance in Britain. The nature of available assistance had little impact on the rate of unemployment, but was very important in explaining who received help. Relief schemes provided assistance on the basis of need rather than labor force status, so that the short-term unemployed, and unemployed dependents rarely received relief, while many of the poor who were not in the labor force were on relief. Demographic factors were of critical importance in explaining who went on relief, with older workers, and those with large families most likely to be on relief for sustained periods. The relief population appears similar to the working class in general because most relief cases show only one or two distinctive features.;1990;Relief not insurance: Canadian unemployment relief in the 1930s;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

McClain, Charles J.;In a recent article (1987, Explorations in Economic History 24, 22–42) on Chinese immigration Patricia Cloud and David Galenson seek to document the mechanisms that made the 19th-century Chinese immigration into the United States possible. They claim that most Chinese immigrants came, in effect, as indentured servants, bound to and under the control of the Chinese district or place associations—the so-called six Chinese companies. This paper takes issue with those conclusions.;1990;Chinese immigration: A comment on cloud and galenson;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"McDonald, John; Shlomowitz, Ralph";The seaboard population of European immigrants to Australia after the mid1850s was probably the first such group whose adult mortality rate at sea was reduced to that on land. We calculate monthly death rates for various age classes and use novel regression techniques to estimate the correlates of mortality. For adults, the main characteristics associated with mortality were length of voyage and degree of crowding. For children and infants, these characteristics were even more highly associated with mortality, as was the tonnage of the vessel. The analysis highlights the special dangers faced by infants from infectious diseases aboard ship.;1990;Mortality on immigrant voyages to Australia in the 19th century;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Mills, Terence C.;This note reexamines Benjamin and Kochin's argument that the Gibson Paradox during the gold standard years of 1729 to 1931 was largely a “visual spurious regression,” movements in both the interest rate and the price level being produced by war. Although Benjamin and Kochin's specification of the variables entering into their model is vindicated by recently developed techniques in time series analysis, appropriate respecification of the dynamic relationship between interest rates and prices reveals that the Gibson Paradox did exist during the gold standard, even when the influence of war is taken into account.;1990;A note on the Gibson Paradox during the gold standard;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Olney, Martha L.;In the United States in the 1920s, households purchased more durable goods and substituted these goods for conventional instruments of saving in their asset portfolios. Using a gradual stock-adjustment model, demand for durable goods is estimated by commodity group for several periods between 1902 and 1983. Demand changed after World War I for all durable goods except china and house furnishings. Increased availability of installment credit helps explain the simultaneous shifts in demand and saving.;1990;Demand for consumer durable goods in 20th century America;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Ravallion, Martin;A common characterization of the 19th century Punjabi peasant is one of a myopic, extravagant person who, when given easier access to credit, eventually becomes impoverished by debt. However, the empirical support for this view is flimsy. The paper tests for excessive “extravagance” among indebted peasants using a small but remarkably detailed farm-household survey for Rohtak District in 1878. The data set offers little statistically convincing support for the historical stereotype. Estimated saving rates suggest that some peasants would have been vulnerable to recurrent drought, but no more so for those in debt. Nor did indebted households tend to have higher marginal propensities to consume. The diversity in consumption/saving behavior bore little association with indebtedness.;1990;Rural indebtedness in the Punjab 1878: Results of a household survey;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Siklos, Pierre L.;Time series techniques are used to examine correlations and lead/lag relationships between money growth and inflation during and after the Hungarian hyperinflation of 1945–1946. Tests reveal several regime shifts. One occurs after the end of the hyperinflation. But others were found within both the hyperinflation and the stabilization periods due to changes in fiscal policy. Correlations between money growth and inflation are high during hyperinflation, but only after the public became convinced that notes could no longer be backed. Correlations are insignificant after stabilization, but government debt did influence inflation while a legal note issue ceiling was in place.;1990;The link between money and prices under different policy regimes: The postwar Hungarian experience;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Snowden, Kenneth A.;Annual holding returns are reported for a broad range of the assets available to investors in the security market between 1872 and 1925. A generally favorable picture of asset performance is revealed when these returns are compared to those on similar investments in the modern era. Two changes in the patterns of returns around 1900 occurred—a decline in inflation adjusted debt returns and an increase in the volatility of stock returns (especially industrial stock). The structure of asset returns after 1900 was distinctly modern and has persisted to the present. The emergence of the modern structure of returns is linked to institutional changes in the security market between 1890 and World War I, and to the process of industrial capital formation.;1990;Historical returns and security market development, 1872–1925;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Temin, Peter; Wigmore, Barrie A.";This paper provides a new account of the recovery from the Great Depression in the second quarter of 1933. Our argument is that President Roosevelt established a new macroeconomic policy regime shortly after his inauguration in March 1933 that altered expectations and stimulated investment. The key to this change was Roosevelt's devaluation of the dollar and the resulting rise in farm prices and incomes. Hoover had been a financial conservative, adhering to the gold standard, a strong dollar, and fiscal orthodoxy. Roosevelt broke with this ideology, devaluing the dollar within 6 weeks of his inauguration, promoting the New Deal, and championing the virtues of inflation. The devaluation of the dollar was the single biggest signal that the iron grip of the gold standard had been broken. The New Deal emerged in the course of 1933 and reinforced the change in regime symbolized by devaluation.;1990;The end of one big deflation;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Weiller, Kenneth J.; Mirowski, Philip";We present a consistent, quarterly time series of English short- and long-term interest rates for the entire 18th century. Instability in the term structure of interest rates cannot be explained solely by wars or government intervention. Applying Shiller variance bounds tests, we find the rational expectations (RE) hypothesis rejected for the century and each subperiod. Using the modifications suggested by M. Flavin however, we reject the RE hypothesis less than half the time. On the other hand, regression tests on the relationships of short-term rates with holding period returns and long-term rates tend against the RE theory of the term structure. The evidence is also interpreted in terms of the 18th century debate between Adam Smith and Henry Thornton over the nature of interest rates.;1990;Rates of interest in 18th century England;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
White, Eugene Nelson;In the early years of the French Revolution, the economic regulations of the ancien régime were dismantled. Pursuing laissez-faire economic policies, the government permitted the formation of hundreds of banks of issue. While many contemporaries and historians have vilified them, these banks do not appear to have affected price stability or created other major problems. This episode offers additional evidence on the viability of free banking, but it also shows how such a system can rapidly disintegrate during a political crisis.;1990;Free banking during the French Revolution;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Williamson, Jeffrey G.;Between the Act of 1815 and Repeal in 1846, the English Corn Laws generated a famous political economy debate. Labor was thought to have suffered from the “bread tax” and profits were thought to have been choked off as the export of manufactures was suppressed. No one, however, has ever offered estimates of who really paid for the subsidy to grain producers. Using a computable general equilibrium model, this paper assesses the distributional incidence of this protectionist regime during the First Industrial Revolution. It turns out there are some surprises: capitalists may not have suffered from the Corn Laws at all. The assessment hinges in part on whether terms of trade gains from protection offset efficiency losses.

"Alston, Lee J.; Hatton, Timothy J.";We estimate the monthly and hourly earnings ratio between agricultural and manufacturing laborers, adjusting for compensation received in-kind and differences in the cost of living.

"Beenstock, Michael; Warburton, Peter";In a previous paper we showed that both the supply and the demand for labor in interwar Britain were wage elastic. In the present paper we extend these efforts by endogenizing wage behavior so that the model provides an account of employment, unemployment, participation, and real wages on an integrated basis. We explain wage behavior in terms of an instantaneously augmented expected Phillips curve in which the natural rate of unemployment depends, inter alia, on unemployment benefit. The paper concludes with a series of counterfactual simulations to expose the factors responsible for the rise and decline of unemployment during the period.;1991;The market for labor in interwar Britain;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Bertaux, Nancy E.;"Looked at broadly, occupational distributions by sex in the United States have changed remarkably little since 1900; accordingly, researchers have found a slow rate of decline in the index of dissimilarity (a measure of occupational segregation by gender), estimates of which have so far been confined to the 20th century. This paper analyzes trends in the index over the latter part of the 19th century. The results indicate that during this period, industrialization and the associated changes in the nature of the business enterprise resulted in a rapid declinne in occupational segregation by gender, as measured by the index. This decline occurs earliest in cities experiencing early industrialization. Index estimates are presented for the United States and for selected midwestern cities, and changes in the index are decomposed into occupational mix effects and sex composition effects. Occupation-specific index changes are used to identify which occupations influenced changes in the overall index. The results indicate that the dynamic occupational shifts of the 19th century set the stage for the “men's jobs” and “women's jobs” that have been so persistently stable in the 20th century.";1991;The roots of today's “women's jobs” and “men's jobs”: Using the index of dissimilarity to measure occupational segregation by gender;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Boyd, Michael L.;This paper synthesizes several existing models of manorial organization and describes the evolution of land tenure regimes in Serbia from the 14th through the 17th centuries in order to evaluate the theories. The relative scarcity of labor, growth of population and trade, and changes in military technology (which served to shift the locus of power between central and local authority) are identified as important factors which affected the evolution of agrarian institutions. In addition, the particular institutions which arose in the two main periods of change were influenced by situation-specific institutional factors which account for variations in outcomes arising from similar sets of initial conditions.;1991;The evolution of agrarian institutions: The case of medieval and Ottoman Serbia;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Carter, Susan B.; Savoca, Elizabeth";Quick, short-lived payoffs to experience in women's occupations about the turn of the century have led to the suggestion that gender differences in occupational distribution and wage rates were the result of profit- and income-maximizing choices in the context of differences in expected firm and occupational tenure. Using micro-level data on California workers in 1892 we develop the first estimates of completed firm and occupational tenure by gender. We show that, while women's tenure was indeed briefer than men's, the differences were too small to have warranted differences in training.;1991;Gender differences in learning and earning in nineteenth-century America: The role of expected job and career attachment;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Chiswick, Barry R.;The 1900 Census of Population microdata file is used to study the occupational status of adult male Jewish immigrants in comparison with other immigrants and native-born white men. On arrival the Jewish immigrants had a low occupational status but they experienced very rapid improvements with duration. Occupational parity was reached with Western European and Canadian immigrants (5 12 years after immigration) and the native born (14 years). The Jewish adjustment pattern followed the model of refugees. Their high level of attainment reflected large human capital investments (at home and in school) and an emphasis on decision making skills.;1991;Jewish immigrant skill and occupational attainment at the turn of the century;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Clark, Gregory;The extent of scale economies in labor utilization in English agriculture before mechanization are investigated using the 1851 Population Census. Contrary to the work of Allen (1988, Explorations in Economic History 25, 117–146), who uses information from Arthur Young's tours circa 1770, it is found that scale economies were of limited significance. Consequently scale economies will explain little of the growth of labor productivity in English agriculture before mechanization, or of the high labor productivity of English agriculture compared to the rest of Europe.;1991;Labor productivity and farm size in English agriculture before mechanization: A note;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Dick, Trevor J.O; Floyd, John E.";This paper offers a new interpretation of Canada's balance of payments experience under the gold standard. A portfolio theory of balance of payments adjustment highlighting the significance of international capital flows is shown to explain the historical evidence better than the traditional price-specie-flow mechanism advocated by Jacob Viner. Adjustment occurs preeminently via transactions in the international capital market. Capital flows are not a response to domestic/foreign interest rate differentials. Canada's investment boom and capital inflow produced changes in domestic relative to foreign prices in violation of purchasing power parity. The theoretical background of the new interpretation is an extension of the monetary approach to balance of payments theory.;1991;Balance of payments adjustment under the international gold standard: Canada, 1871–1913;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Federico, Giovanni; Tena, Antonio";This work questions Morgenstern's pessimistic results on the reliability of aggregate international foreign trade statistics: His comparisons using pairs of countries can only test the misclassification of a country's trade flow. Aggregation, by contrast, eliminates this problem. Therefore, testing the total value of imports and exports with the sum of the same trade flows as registered by their partner countries' statistics, leads to more encouraging conclusions on the aggregate data. Our results strengthen considerably one's trust in the reliability of pre-World War II foreign trade statistics. Diversity in individual countries' accuracy indexes can be partially explained by differences in freight factors and also by minor differences in compilation.;1991;On the accuracy of foreign trade statistics (1909–1935): Morgenstern revisited;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Field, Alexander James;The argument of this paper reduces to two key propositions. First, legal rules differ where technologies and endowments are similar. Second, diversity matters, in the sense that it exercises an independent influence on economic structure and rates of economic growth, and in ways that have not fully been explored. Recent literature has tended to limit the effect of law on productive use (the sectoral distribution of inputs) to its efficacy in overcoming or not introducing bargain-impeding transactions costs. Insufficient attention has been given to the macro-economic consequences of variation in income and expenditure flows associated with different legal systems or assignments of legal rights, which have traditionally been considered principally with reference to issues of equity or fairness, as distinguished from their impact on economic structure.;1991;Do legal systems matter?;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Gerber, Jim;Although white children in the postbellum South benefited from the diversion of black school funds, both races had measures of schooling below the national norm. In particular, plantation states had the least commitment to public school systems. This paper theorizes that the tendency for education to create geographical and occupational mobility ran counter to the interests of southern landlords. It shows that agricultural production based on unskilled and highly supervised tenant farming was a major reason for the slow acceptance of universal free schooling in the plantation region of the United States.;1991;Public school expenditures in the plantation states, 1910;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Hanson II, John R.;Building on J. Hanson (1988, Explorations in Economic History, 25, 323–336), I compare several sets of estimates of per capita income or product in the Third World before World War I, using consistency with independent evidence as the standard of evaluation. Specifically, each set of estimates is correlated with 1913 exports per capita and literacy rates early in the 20th century. The estimates derived from the work of the United Nation International Comparison Project, which are the highest in the group, are found to be the most plausible based on these tests.;1991;Third world incomes before world war I: Further evidence;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Hatton, Timothy J.; Williamson, Jeffrey G.";In the 1890s, nominal farm wages in Michigan were only about 50% of unskilled city wages. Before we can conclude that such gaps were manifestations of labor market segmentation, they must be adjusted by the fact that in the cities living costs were higher, unemployment may have been higher, city workers may have been older, and farm laborers received perquisites. Using some Michigan Bureau of Labor surveys, we show that the 50% nominal wage gap collapses to a real earnings gap of 9 to 13%. On the basis of this evidence, much of the gaps between farm and city are an illusion.;1991;Wage gaps between farm and city: Michigan in the 1890s;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Hickson, Charles R.; Thompson, Earl A.";This paper presents and tests a new interpretation of European guilds and the economic effects of their policies. The traditional view, from classical economics, is that guilds, at least those of the bureaucratively active, entry-restrictive variety common in late medieval Europe, were monopolistic and economically inefficient, representing net drains on the society's resources. In contrast, our interpretation is that such guilds were first adopted and then eliminated by legislatively pragmatic European states soon after the corresponding changes in economic policy were in the substantial collective interest of the members of the state. And states abandoning legislative pragmatism in favor of legislative ideology, classical economics included, have systematically overdiscouraged guilds and suffered greatly as a result.;1991;A new theory of guilds and european economic development;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Huberman, Michael;Using yarn prices and output as proxies for wages and employment, this paper asks how cotton spinning firms in the heyday of industrialization responded to demand shocks. The evidence is consistent with a two-sector efficiency wage model composed of large and small firms. Large firms incurred monitoring costs on their new technology. To eliminate shirking, they paid efficiency wages and laid off workers when faced by a reduction in demand. In small firms technical change was slower, and since monitoring was not a problem, they cut wages. Over the period, the number of small firms declined and layoffs increased.;1991;How did labor markets work in lancashire? more evidence on prices and quantities in cotton spinning, 1822–1852;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Lewchuk, Wayne A.;Did workplace characteristics, such as the degree of mechanization or the level of managerial control, systematically influence occupational mortality rates in France at the beginning of the 20th century? Data from an early 20th-century study of occupational mortality in France lead us to conclude that long hours of work, under conditions where labor had limited control of the pace of work, represented the most serious occupational risk facing early French workers. The effect of long hours of work on mortality dwarfed the impact of either mechanization or size of establishment.;1991;Industrialization and occupational mortality in France prior to 1914;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"McDonald, John; Shlomowitz, Ralph";We construct a consistent series of assisted passenger fares on sailing vessels to Australia from the United Kingdom between 1847 and 1885. The passenger fares are subjected to a statistical analysis which suggests that the real fares varied with variables measuring total demand for shipping space, relative demand on the outward and homeward legs, the number of assisted passengers embarked, and the season of the voyage. The results are evaluated in the context of the joint production characteristics of a voyage whereby shipping space is necessarily available on the outward and homeward legs, and the general characteristics of Europe-Far East shipping trade.;1991;Passenger fares on sailing vessels to Australia in the nineteenth century;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Nye, John Vincent C.;The signing of the 1860 Anglo-French Treaty of Commerce is the central event that ushered in the first great era of free trade in Western Europe. Yet we still lack a thorough analysis of the history and the economics of the treaty. The two questions that need to be answered are: (1) What effects did the treaty have on French national welfare? and (2) What explains the timing and successful shift toward more open trade of a nation that had been staunchly opposed to tariff reform for over half a century? In this essay, I estimate a system of export equations as a first step toward a comprehensive analysis of the 1860 treaty. I argue that real changes in the nature of world trade increased the potential benefits to be derived from free trade and raised the costs of the existing system of prohibitions. The changing external conditions combined with internal political considerations to make a regime of moderate tariffs increasingly desirable to a larger segment of the French populace, thus sustaining what would otherwise have been a wholly unacceptable action on the part of the Emperor Napoleon III. Moreover, the trade estimates suggest that the French economy benefited from the abolition of prohibitions and the move to lower tariffs.;1991;Changing French trade conditions, national welfare, and the 1860 Anglo-French Treaty of Commerce;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
O’Rourke, Kevin Hjortshøj;The paper asks whether Irish emigration between 1856 and 1876 was due to labor being pulled out of Ireland by higher wages abroad, or to labor being pushed off the land as a result of price shocks in international commodity markets favoring pasture over tillage. A computational general equilibrium model of the Irish agricultural sector is constructed and subjected to the wage and price shocks experienced by the economy over the period. The model suggests that all the rural depopulation occurring during this period was due to wage shocks (i.e., foreign labor demand), and none to commodity price shocks.;1991;Rural depopulation in a small open economy: Ireland 1856–1876;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Riley, James C.;Life expectancy at working ages has improved substantially since the 18th century. But the probability of survival in health, which is a joint probability, shows much less substantial improvement. This conclusion is based on a comparison of health and survival experience in four British populations, one preindustrial, two industrial, and one postindustrial. It suggests that economic growth should be attributed only in small measure to gains in working health time.;1991;Working health time: A comparison of preindustrial, industrial, and postindustrial experience in life and health;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Solomou, Solomos; Weale, Martin";The three different ways of calculating GDP lead to different results. This problem is more marked in the period before 1914 than with the more recent data. The conventional solution is to resolve the discrepancy by calculating a compromise estimate as an arithmetic average of the three different estimates. Such an approach has little basis in statistical theory. This paper presents balanced estimates of GDP derived using a more satisfactory statistical method. It then compares these balanced estimates with the more conventional compromise estimates.;1991;Balanced estimates of UK GDP 1870–1913;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Boyce, Gordon;Analysis of British capital market operations before 1914 has focused on institutional and investor behavior without fully considering entrepreneurial conduct. Consequently, those who argue that industrial performance was impaired because capital flows were obstructed by information blockages have overlooked the role company owners could play in shaping communication lines. The fund-raising techniques used by shipowners reveal that private capital attracted through preferential communication channels supported the rise of large-scale enterprise. Founders were not motivated by supply constraints, nor did they forego profits to retain control.

"Broadberry, Stephen N.; Crafts, Nicolas F. R.";This article proposes a reinterpretation of the failure of interwar British productivity levels to match those of the United States. We argue that key elements in poor British productivity performance included inadequate human capital, a bargaining environment that allowed workers to maintain restrictive practices, and collusive agreements that limited the exit of inefficient firms. We suggest that weaknesses in the structure of British firms pointed out by Chandler and his followers have been overemphasized and that more attention should be given to the role of the market environment in determining the conduct of business.;1992;Britain's Productivity Gap in the 1930s: Some Neglected Factors;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Clark, Gregory;The Postan thesis is that medieval agriculture had low yields because there was insufficient pasture to keep the arable land fertile. This argument (and variants of it) has become an orthodox technological explanation for low preindustrial yields. Yet the thesis, on its face, implies that early cultivators were ignorant, irrational, or completely custom bound. This article develops a revised Postan thesis, in which medieval cultivators knew that pasture restored fertility but were unwilling to employ it.

Grubb, Farley;The incidence of fatherlessness among English emigrant servants was measured using contracts recorded in London between 1682 and 1686. This incidence was relatively high and systematically related to the servant's age, gender, county of origin, occupation, and father's occupation. Many emigrant servants were youths who had lost their fathers and lacked alternative support in England. Fatherlessness helps explain why the short-run supply of emigrant servants was relatively inelastic, and why some unskilled servants continued to migrate to America in spite of competition from slave labor.;1992;Fatherless and Friendless: Factors Influencing the Flow of English Emigrant Servants;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Guinnane, Timothy W.;Economic historians have stressed the importance of households and household formation but have devoted little attention to the process of leaving home. Leaving home in Ireland is important because of households' role in post-Famine demographic patterns. A matched Irish manuscript census sample for 1901 and 1911 shows that Irish males left home later than females. Statistical tests show that much of this reflects an Irish inheritance system that led many males never to leave home.

Within the historical literature there exist two main hypotheses concerning the passage of these tariff acts. Schattschneider (1935; Politics, Pressures and the Tariff: A Study of Free Private Enterprise in Pressure Politics, as Shown in the 1929–1930 Revision of the Tariff.

First, why is seigneurial tenure compulsorily terminated in 1854 despite the fact that voluntary commutation had been possible for decades but unheard of except in urban areas? Second, why does the government of the Province of Canada step in with substantial financial aid to achieve commutation? The evidence suggests that an explanation in terms of the income distributional consequences of commutation offers more insight into its timing and the role of government than does one focusing on the gains in economic efficiency.;1992;The political economy of the abolition of seigneurial tenure in Canada East;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Romer, Christina D.;This paper examines the role of aggregate-demand stimulus in ending the Great Depression. Plausible estimates of the effects of fiscal and monetary changes indicate that nearly all the observed recovery of the U.S. economy prior to 1942 was due to monetary expansion. A huge gold inflow in the mid- and late 1930s swelled the money stock and stimulated the economy by lowering real interest rates and encouraging investment spending and purchases of durable goods. That monetary developments were crucial to the recovery implies that self-correction played little role in the growth of real output between 1933 and 1942.;1992;What Ended the Great Depression?;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Sicsic, Pierre;Wage gaps between farm and city are used to assess whether industrialization in late nineteenth-century France was choked off by peasants' alleged reluctance to move. If industry suffered due to labor scarcity, wage gaps should have been large and rising. It turns out that the wage gap, when adjusted for costs of living and computed as an average of 20 regional wage gaps, was nil in 1852 and about 25 percent in 1892. Thus wage gaps were rising but were far smaller throughout the late nineteenth century than they were in England during similar stages of industrialization.;1992;City-Farm Wage Gaps in Late Nineteenth-Century France;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Sicsic, Pierre;This paper argues that fear of a speculation-led overvaluation was the major motive in deciding to stop the appreciation of the franc in December 1926. It is pointed out that the huge depreciation experienced in the first half of 1926 has not yet been convincingly explained in terms of “fundamentals” and therefore that the “destabilizing speculation view” still has some appeal. In an attempt to assess the undervaluation of the franc in 1926, an analysis is made of the composition of the available wholesale price index. It is shown that the WPI is nothing but a proxy of the exchange rate. Employing the retail price index however, the franc clearly appears to have been undervalued.;1992;Was the franc poincaré deliberately undervalued?;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Sumner, Scott;Recent studies have suggested that excessive increases in the monetary demand for gold may have contributed to the worldwide deflation and depression of the early 1930s. These increases have been attributed to currency hoarding as well as a lack of coordination among the major central banks. This paper examines whether news relating to these factors could have contributed to declining stock prices in the United States during the early stages of the Great Depression. There is some evidence that stock market participants expected monetary policy coordination, perhaps through the Bank of International Settlements, and that the market reacted adversely to political events that made cooperation more difficult.;1992;The role of the international gold standard in commodity price deflation: Evidence from the 1929 stock market crash;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The Fed also agreed to buy and sell short-term government bonds at a below-market rate of 3/8 percent.

It suggests that the acceleration was to a large extent due to the improvement of domestic transport infrastructure.

In the state of Kansas, which had a system of voluntary deposit insurance and where branch banking was strictly prohibited, bank failure rates were highest in counties suffering the greatest agricultural distress and where deposit insurance system membership was highest. The evidence for Kansas illustrates how prohibitions on branch banking caused unit banks to be especially vulnerable to local economic shocks and suggests that deposit insurance caused more bank failures than would have occurred otherwise.;1992;Regulation and Bank Failures: New Evidence from the Agricultural Collapse of the 1920s;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Abramovitz, Moses;Many economic historians, like most economists, depend on standard growth accounts to provide some quantitative description of the proximate sources of growth, but this is misleading. American growth experience illustrates the difficulty. The seeming major contribution of tangible capital accumulation to nineteenth-century growth was the consequence of scale-dependent and capital-using technological progress. The large twentieth-century contributions of education and R&D conceal technology's new intangible capital-using bias. Additionally, reverse forces run from capital accumulation to technological progress. Without a greater understanding of these interactions, our knowledge of even the proximate sources of growth is incomplete.;1993;The Search for the Sources of Growth: Areas of Ignorance, Old and New;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Brandt, Loren;During the interwar period, rates of growth in Japanese agriculture fell to half of what they were before the war. Most explanations for this decline center on the consequences for agriculture of the Colonial Rice Policy and the exhaustion by the end of Meiji of a backlog in land-saving rice technology inherited from Tokugawa. This paper provides an alternative perspective: Not only has the role of a decline in technological progress been exaggerated, but also independently of the decision of the Japanese government to invest in the dissemination of Japanese rice technology to the colonies, imports would have substantially increased and rates of growth in domestic agriculture fallen. Underlying this behavior are three largely neglected factors in the literature on prewar Japanese agriculture: increasing labor constraints in the Japanese economy, limited input substitution possibilities for coping with them, and Japan′s integration with the rest of the rapidly expanding Monsoon Asia market prior to WW I. Our analysis suggests that it is largely in the context of developments in the nonagricultural sector and in terms of Japan′s shifting comparative advantage vis-à-vis the rest of Monsoon Asia that trends in agriculture during the interwar period can best be explained. Moreover, if there is a technological dimension to the faltering growth, it has to do with the slow pace of labor-saving and not land-saving innovations, as widely believed. Finally, the Colonial Rice Policy, by erecting a tariff barrier against cheaper rice from outside the Empire, actually slowed the movement of labor out of agriculture and into the nonagricultural sector.;1993;Interwar Japanese Agriculture: Revisionist Views on the Impact of the Colonial Rice Policy and the Labor-Surplus Hypothesis;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The data set consists of a 3% sample of immigrants drawn from the manifests of ships landing at Halifax and Quebec in 1912. Our principal finding is that the differing regional settlement patterns of immigrants specifying intentions to work in different sectors, the high correlation between immigrants intended and previous occupations, and anecdotal evidence suggest that immigrants did match their skills to demand in Canada as part of a labor market which apparently stretched back across the Atlantic (or at least to the ships that carried them to Canada).;1993;Balanced Growth and the Geographical Distribution of European Immigrant Arrivals to Canada, 1900-1912;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Gregory, Paul R.; Mokhtari, Manouchehr";"This paper reexamines the Soviet grain procurement crises that preceded the collectivization decision. It uses regional cross-section data to study the effects of extraordinary measures and of relative state/private purchase prices on the ""private grain surplus""-the amount of grain retained by peasants or sold to private markets. We find that the peasant economy was extremely sensitive to relative state/private grain prices as long as marketing decisions were relatively free. This price sensitivity rendered the system of private agriculture, private markets, and administrative state pricing incompatible. The state could not set arbitrary grain prices below market without resorting to administrative resource allocation. The model identifies the growing force of administrative measures, which, by 1927/1928, dominated the agricultural economy. The evidence in this paper clearly supports the view that the grain collection crisis was induced by state pricing policy. It therefore questions Stalin′s rationales for forced collectivization. In fact, very strong administrative measures were applied before 1927/1928 to prevent the decline in official procurement from being even greater. The experience of the late 1920s underscores the difficulties inherent in combining private market decision making with the planners′ desire to administratively control the flow of resources. When private markets are asked to coexist with administrative resource direction, the private sector typically is able to divert resources away from planned activities.";1993;State Grain Purchases, Relative Prices, and the Soviet Grain Procurement Crisis;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Simulations suggest that a relatively small bank failure shock could lead to a 2% decline in real GNP, while the consequences of a large bank failure shock-a one-fifth decline in GNP-could be catastrophic.;1993;The Macroeconomic Consequences of Bank Failures under the National Banking System;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Hatton, Timothy J.; Bailey, Roy E.";This paper uses survey evidence from interwar Britain to investigate the effects of market forces and household composition on the labor market participation of females. Historical studies of female domestic and market work patterns at that time are reviewed in order to inform the choice of explanatory variables for binary probit analysis of individual and ordered probit analysis of household participation decisions. The statistical results show that the marital status of a woman (more importantly than the presence of dependent children) lowered the participation rate. The presence of children and adult males in the household are found to reduce the probability of participation of other females in the household as does the total level of household income. Wages are found to have a positive effect on participation in market work but the elasticity appears to be lower than that for more recent times.;1993;Household Labor Supply and Women′s Work in Interwar Britain;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Hatton, Timothy J.; Williamson, Jeffrey G.";This article examines the determinants of emigration from post-Famine Ireland. As Irish real wages rose relative to those in destination countries, the emigration rate fell. We argue, from time series analysis, that much of the secular fall in the rate can be explained by that narrowing of the wage gap. County-level, cross-sectional analysis of emigration rates indicates that poverty and low wages, large family size, and limited opportunities to acquire smallholdings all contributed to high rates of emigration. Changes in those variables over time reflect the rise in living standards, consistent with time series evidence.;1993;After the Famine: Emigration from Ireland, 1850???1913;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Herscovici, Steven;This article draws on evidence from the 1860 federal manuscript census to study wealth inequality among the adult male population of Boston. The analysis reveals that Boston was relatively wealthy, but wealth was distributed unequally. Even after controlling for age and occupation, immigrants held significantly less wealth than and exhibited strikingly different wealth holding patterns from natives. Additionally, the effect of age differed markedly among nativities as older immigrants were less skilled than younger immigrants. In addition to providing estimates of overall inequality in Boston, the paper isolates the effects of principal demographic characteristics on wealth holding and wealth inequality.;1993;The Distribution of Wealth in Nineteenth Century Boston: Inequality among Natives and Immigrants, 1860;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Inwood, Kris; Wagg, Phyllis";Handloom weaving with a mixture of wool and cotton yarn was common in late nineteenth-century Canada. The hand technology survived using industrial inputs and part-time female labor whose opportunity cost was relatively low in rural areas. The demand for homespun was income-sensitive and reinforced by the cold Canadian climate. The patterns of weaving by men and women differed, but both produced for the market in addition to home consumption. Cloth constituted a significant share of farm production, especially in low-income areas.;1993;The Survival of Handloom Weaving in Rural Canada Circa 1870;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Kauffman, Kyle D.;The relative number of mules versus horses varied between the North and the South and across the South. This paper tests the hypothesis that mule use in the South varied positively with sharecroppers in order to limit the capital depreciation of workstock. The evidence comes from two data sets: (1) microlevel plantation data from Georgia and (2) county-level data from 1920. Both indicate that mules were used more, the greater the overall use of draft animals by nonowners. For a number of reasons, mules are preferred to horses when principals find it difficult to monitor agents.;1993;Why Was the Mule Used in Southern Agriculture?

Analysis of biographical information and complete patent histories through 1865 indicates that these ???great inventors??? were entrepreneurial and responded systematically to market demand. Their inventions were procyclical and originated disproportionately from localities linked with extensive markets. Although unexceptional in terms of schooling or technical skills, they vigorously pursued the returns to their inventions, redirected their inventive activity to meet emerging needs, and were distinguished by high geographical mobility toward districts conducive to invention and its commercialization.;1993;???Schemes of Practical Utility???: Entrepreneurship and Innovation Among ???Great Inventors??? in the United States, 1790???1865;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Kim, Seung-Wook; Fishback, Price V.";The labor markets in the railroad industry went through extensive institutional changes between 1890 and 1945. Federal laws increased railroad employers' liability for workplace accidents in several stages. Unions expanded to cover more occupations. The federal government set railroad wages during World War I and then mediated and arbitrated a large number of collective bargaining disputes between 1920 and 1945. We examine how these changes in institutions affected compensating differentials for fatal and nonfatal accident risk. The increasing role of unionization and government intervention coincided with a decline in the size of compensating differentials.;1993;Institutional Change, Compensating Differentials, and Accident Risk in American Railroding, 1892???1945;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Kimura, Mitsuhiko;This article discusses the changing living standards among the Korean masses under Japanese rule. Farm income per household, agricultural real wages, and per capita calorie intake from staple foods declined. On the other hand primary school enrollment, literacy, and survival rates rose, and average stature at least did not decrease. Arguing that literacy rates, survival rates, and average stature are variables more directly related to living conditions than the others, this article concludes that the Korean masses' standards of living rose between colonization and 1940. Still, any summary assessment depends on the weights assigned to different variables.;1993;Standards of Living in Colonial Korea: Did the Masses Become Worse Off or Better Off Under Japanese Rule?;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Klovland, Jan Tore;New monthly estimates of the wholesale price level in the UK 1845-1890 are presented. No monthly price index has previously been available for these years. The index replicates as far as possible the well-known Sauerbeck price index, being constructed from monthly price quotations for 45 commodities. Some aspects of short-run movements in these commodity prices are examined, particularly with respect to relative price variability, the cyclical behavior of prices, and seasonality. It is found that prices of some storable commodities, notably coal and metals, exhibited distinct seasonal patterns, giving rise to significant excess returns from seasonal commodity speculation.;1993;Zooming in on Sauerbeck: Monthly Wholesale Prices in Britain 1845-1890;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Lee, Ronald;New insights emerge when we analyze Malthusian systems in a stochastic environment which makes both productivity and reproduction random variables. Then the equilibrating system determines probability distributions for population and wages. Within these distributions, the positions of population size and wages are determined at any historical moment mainly by more recent shocks, as homeostasis slowly overcomes the influence of older ones, which have a half-life of about 70 years. Stronger homeostasis may increase or diminish the variance of population size, but it reduces the variance of wages, by leading population size to track more closely changes in the demand for labor. The interrelation of population and wages, and the absence of exogenous variables, makes estimation and testing treacherous, leading to mistaken inferences in the literature. Long waves in European demographic history do not arise from homeostasis and may simply reflect the demographic cumulation of random shocks, rather than a cyclic driving force.;1993;Accidental and Systematic Change in Population History: Homeostasis in a Stochastic Setting;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Lewchuk, Wayne A.;The introduction of mass production transformed many skilled tasks into repetitive and monotonous jobs. In industries such as automobiles, the workforce remained predominantly male despite contemporary assessments that women could efficiently do many of these jobs. This article explores why.

Oppers, Stefan E.;It is generally recognized that the Dutch played a major part in financing British government deficits from the 1720s to the late 1770s. This article argues that even though the Dutch continued to hold large amounts of British debt after 1780, they stopped supplying new capital to the British and started a modest repatriation of some of their previous investments. A comparative econometric study of 3 percent consol yields during the two deficit-inducing wars Britain fought between 1750 and 1795 shows that as a result British interest rates became much more sensitive to increases in government borrowing.;1993;The Interest Rate Effect of Dutch Money in Eighteenth-Century Britain;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Rosenthal, Jean-Laurent;This paper analyzes a sample of loan contracts from a town in southeastern France between 1630 and 1788. The data suggest that credit markets were both active and flexible. Prior to 1750 a wide range of interest rates was charged to different borrowers for perpetual annuities. Interest rates and size of loan were highly correlated with social ranking. After 1750 financial innovation led lenders to charge 5% on nearly all perpetual annuities. The market grew significantly between 1700 and 1789 because intermediaries were able to adapt short-term credit contracts to serve a larger and larger segment of the population.;1993;Credit Markets and Economic Change in Southeastern France 1630-1788;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Wahl, Jenny Bourne;Antebellum judges played crucial roles in resolving conflicts between slaveowners and common-carrier owners. Because courts could easily quantify the value of a slave's life, they were quicker to compensate slaveowners for slaves injured or killed by a common carrier than to award damages to an injured free person or his estate. Yet judges also had to craft rules governing the behavior of the slave property itself. By the 1860s, Southern courts had established law that encouraged parties with legal standing to act efficiently. Strikingly, tort doctrines developed in slave cases foreshadowed the evolution of law for free accident victims.;1993;The Bondsman's Burden: An Economic Analysis of the Jurisprudence of Slaves and Common Carriers;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Weir, David R.;This article re-examines the secular improvement in human heights in France. Adult heights reflect consumption as children, so the distribution of resources between children and adults, determined primarily within households, should have influenced heights. The intrahousehold distribution of resources was influenced by the level of income and by the calorie demands of working adults. Results show that the early decline of marital fertility in France was accompanied by a small but significant increase in expenditures on child quality as measured by heights. Reductions in mortality, independent of the level of food intake, also contributed to improved heights.;1993;Parental Consumption Decisions and Child Health During the Early French Fertility Decline, 1790???1914;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

It finds that the number of banks per capita and the ratio of state-chartered to federally chartered banks were highest in states with deposit insurance systems, low minimum capital requirements, and branching restrictions. In the 1920s banking consolidation was greatest where falling incomes caused high failure rates, in states with deposit insurance, and where branching increased. After 1920, the high failure rate of insured state banks caused the ratio of state???chartered to federally chartered banks to decline relatively more in states with insurance systems.;1993;Government Policy and Banking Market Structure in the 1920s;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Wolcott, Susan;The textbook explanation for Britain's high unemployment in the 1920s is that the return to gold at ¤4.86 left the currency overvalued. Recent estimates suggest that an 11 percent devaluation would have eliminated roughly half the unemployment in 1925. This article questions the validity of that conclusion. It measures the power of exchange rate devaluations to decrease unemployment in the context of sectorally distinct labor markets. The results suggest that though a devaluation would have been helpful, eliminating half of 1925's unemployment would have required one much greater than 11 percent and would have caused significant price pressures.;1993;Keynes Versus Churchill: Revaluation and British Unemployment in the 1920s;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

By focusing on rural banks we are able to investigate the impacts of agricultural distress and government policies on the class of banks accounting for 80% of the failures in the decade. Failure rates were highest where farm acreage and land values had increased the most before 1920 because these regions suffered the worst agricultural distress subsequently. Agricultural distress caused more bank failures in states with deposit insurance systems, suggesting that insurance encouraged banks to increase risk as their net worth declined.;1994;Why Do Banks Fail?

Broadberry, Stephen N.;Conventional accounts of comparative Anglo-American economic performance, based on national accounts data, see Britain as the labor productivity leader until the 1890s. However, figures for the manufacturing sector suggest that U.S. labor productivity was already substantially higher than that in Britain by the early nineteenth century. The U.S. rise to overall productivity leadership was thus due to a combination of trends in nonmanufacturing sectors and distributional shifts into the high-productivity manufacturing sector rather than due to trends within manufacturing. Although in agriculture Britain had higher labor productivity than that in America, Britain still had a comparative advantage in manufacturing on account of resource endowments.;1994;Comparative Productivity in British and American Manufacturing during the Nineteenth Century;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Carlos, Ann M.;The paper focuses on the argument found extensively in the literature that the managers of early chartered companies operated in their own self-interest and thus were these companies own worst enemies. Using recent work from both the labor and the efficient contracts literature and archival material from one of these companies-the Royal African Company-I argue that the view prevalent in the literature greatly overstates the level of agent opportunism. The contract between the Royal African Company and its managers was well designed to mitigate moral hazard. While the Company paid a non-compensating differential, the interesting feature of the contract is the use of bonding. This study, while arguing that these early chartered companies did attenuate managerial opportunism, describes a fully functioning bonding market for managers. The paper also argues that the Royal African Company, because of an inappropriate head office structure (one which was imposed on the company in its charter), was unable to develop an internal trust network between subordinate and superior which would have helped further to reduce moral hazard.;1994;Bonding and the Agency Problem: Evidence from the Royal African Company, 1672-1691;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

To reduce transaction costs, mill managers avoided investing in the western part of the island where the sugar industry was well established.

Two pieces of evidence support this conclusion. First, uncertainty (as measured by the risk premium embedded in the term structure of interest rates) rises during the banking crises and is positively linked to financial-market volatility associated with the breakdown in the gold standard. Second, the risk premium explains a significant proportion of the variation in aggregate investment spending during the Great Depression.;1994;Uncertainty as a Propagating Force in The Great Depression;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Hypotheses abound, but no consensus has emerged nor have scholars tested hypotheses. In this study, quantitative evidence for the final sixty years of immigrant servitude establishes when and why it disappeared. Servitude did not end because of insufficient demand, legal restrictions, or declines in passage fares. It ended because superior methods of financing migration developed.

Wartime servant supplies fell, driving down contract lengths and raising servant costs. Except for teenage females, the colonial demand for servants and the cross-price effect on the demand for slaves are estimated to be elastic.

Guinnane, Timothy W.;Horace Plunkett′s Irish cooperative association introduced credit cooperatives into Ireland in 1894. The Irish cooperatives were modeled on the very successful Raiffeisen credit cooperatives of rural Germany. Credit cooperatives were never successful in Ireland, in contrast to other branches of Irish cooperation. Irish bankers argued that credit cooperatives failed simply because there was no need for such an institution. Several observers, including parliamentary bodies, came to the opposite conclusion: credit was expensive for smallholders, and credit cooperatives were a potential solution to the problem. This essay argues that several features of the Irish economic and social environment undermined the cooperative′s operation. The Irish credit cooperatives never attracted as members the more prosperous locals who provided crucial monitoring and expertise in Germany. The Irish cooperative movement was also never able to develop the strong central auditing federations that supervised and certified German cooperatives. Finally, rural Irish people seemed reluctant to force their neighbors to repay loans or face adverse consequences, which undermined the monitoring and enforcement advantages that cooperatives potentially have over commercial banks. This episode illustrates both the importance of timing in institutional development and the difficulty of transplanting institutions from one social and economic context to another.;1994;A Failed Institutional Transplant: Raiffeisen′s Credit Cooperatives in Ireland, 1894-1914;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The dominant position of the Company and of its national debt conversion scheme in the affairs of England in 1720 support the conclusion that the act was in fact a piece of special-interest legislation for the Company. The short-term interest that motivated the enactment, together with the limited legal and economic effects of the act, minimized its significance as a turning point in the long-term development of the English joint-stock company.;1994;The Bubble Act: Its Passage and Its Effects on Business Organization;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Heinicke, Craig;Previous studies have forwarded cotton harvest mechanization as a major explanation of African-American outmigration from the rural South between 1950 and 1960. The paper investigates this hypothesis and finds that the effect has been overstated. In order to link previous estimates of migration to displacement by mechanization, an estimate is made of the number of cotton acres upon which mechanized harvesting would have been profitable in 1959 and of the number of African-Americans harvesting that acreage. It is found that about one-fourth of the migration could have resulted directly from the harvester.;1994;African-American Migration and Mechanized Cotton Harvesting, 1950-1960;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Irwin, James R.;County-level census data are used to evaluate the decline in southern per capita output from 1860 to 1880. Two explanations have been offered. The slave-labor hypothesis argues that per capita output declined because of a fall in African-Americans′ labor supply (as former slaves reduced their labor force participation and hours of work). The plantation-efficiency hypothesis argues instead that the productive efficiency of southern agriculture fell with the collapse of the plantation system, as former plantation slaves escaped gang labor and collective living arrangements. Econometric tests strongly support the plantation-efficiency hypothesis, but not the slave-labor hypothesis.;1994;Explaining the Decline in Southern per Capita Output after Emancipation;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Johnson, Ronald N.; Libecap, Gary D.";This paper examines the gradual displacement of patronage by merit employment in the Federal Government. Standard explanations for civil service reform emphasize either moral outrage among progressives or the desire of politicians to provide tenure for party faithful. These explanations do not satisfactorily describe the timing or pattern of the shift from patronage. Indeed, we show that purely partisan motivations to tenure government employees played a relatively smaller role in the growth of the merit system than has been stressed in the historical literature. We use the economics of organization to analyze the change in the federal labor contract. This approach provides a more comprehensive explanation for the timing of the shift to merit, the identity of the interest groups involved, why particular politicians would be responsive to their demands, and why merit employees subsequently were granted tenure.;1994;Patronage to Merit and Control of the Federal Government Labor Force;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Lindert, Peter H.;A closer look at the dawn of social spending before 1930 reinterprets the timing, sources, and effects of its rise.

Maloney, Thomas N.;The gap between the mean wages of black men and white men in the United States narrowed substantially between 1940 and 1950. There was, however, almost no change in this wage gap between 1950 and 1960. Some of this discontinuity in the path of black progress can be explained by general changes in the wage structure???wage compression in the 1940s and slight expansion in the 1950s. However, most of the gains of the 1940s were driven by race-specific factors, including increasing relative wages controlling for worker characteristics. These race-specific gains ceased in the 1950s.;1994;Wage Compression and Wage Inequality Between Black and White Males in the United States, 1940???1960;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
McLean, Ian W.;Aggregate saving rates in both Australia and Canada have risen from below 10 to over 20% since the 1860s, but in contrast to the U.S. historical pattern, this occurs in two jumps of similar size in each country after 1900 and following 1945. Over the whole period, demographic (life-cycle) influences significantly determine saving in both Australia and Canada, while for Australia foreign saving (capital inflow) and domestic saving are inversely related. Closer examination of the jump in Australian domestic saving after 1900 reveals a complex interaction of influences at work following a period of negative shocks to incomes, wealth, and confidence in financial institutions.;1994;Saving in Settler Economies: Australian and North American Comparisons;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Sicsic, Pierre;This paper, which uses micro data from the two mid-century French industrial censuses, offers two main conclusions about the structure of French industry. First, it shows that while average firm size was small in French manufacturing as a whole, cotton textile factories were not much smaller than their British or American counterparts. Second, it shows that there is evidence of increasing returns to scale in France, especially in small-scale traditional sectors. It seems that the average size in these sectors in France during the second half of the century remained small, while it increased elsewhere. Thus, some potential economies of scale were not exploited.;1994;Establishment Size and Economies of Scale in 19th-Century France;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

These constraints had implications for the labor market as well.

Close attention to the operation of such social norms can add much explanatory power to conventional economic analyses of discrimination based on human capital and taste for discrimination.;1994;The Color Line: Racial Norms and Discrimination in Urban Labor Markets, 1910???1950;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

A new concept???the ???industrious revolution??????is proposed to place the Industrial Revolution in a broader historical setting. The industrious revolution was a process of household-based resource reallocation that increased both the supply of marketed commodities and labor and the demand for market-supplied goods. The industrious revolution was a household-level change with important demand-side features that preceded the Industrial Revolution, a supply-side phenomenon.

Kansas banks were severely stressed by a collapse of commodity prices in 1920 and the resulting increase in loan defaults. We find that banks belonging to the state deposit insurance system maintained lower capital/asset ratios, which may explain their comparatively high failure rate. Despite delays, and eventual suspension of insurance payments, we find no evidence of a decline in the credibility of insurance, and hence in the ability of insured banks to take excessive risks, before the system′s collapse in 1926.;1994;"""The Slack Banker Dances:"" Deposit Insurance and Risk-Taking in the Banking Collapse of the 1920s";Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

By that we mean that the authorities could temporarily abandon the fixed price of gold during an emergency (such as wartime) on the understanding that convertibility at the original price of gold would be restored when the emergency passed.;1995;The Gold Standard As a Rule: An Essay in Exploration;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Brinkley, Garland L.;Few economic historians have addressed the impact of poor health on economic productivity.1 This relationship, neglected and poorly understood, is the subject of my dissertation. Specifically, the dissertation examines the effect of a chronic debilitating disease on agricultural productivity in the American South between 1860 and 1940. As is well known, per capita gross agricultural output dropped sharply during the Civil War decade and remained low until 1910. Contrary to what one would expect, between 1870 and 1910 agricultural output was lowest in sandy soil regions and highest in regions composed mostly of clay soil. A rapid expansion of per capita agricultural output occurred after 1910. The income decline of the Civil War decade and subsequent increase of the post-1910 era were also related to soil region, with the greatest income swing occurring in sandy soil regions.;1995;The Economic Impact of Disease in the American South, 1860???1940;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Broadberry, Stephen N.; Ritschl, Albrecht O.";This paper links together separate national debates on the role of real wages in high unemployment in Britain and Germany during the 1920′s. Real wage growth outstripped labor productivity growth in both countries during the 1920′s, raising the natural rate of unemployment. Econometric labor demand functions are used to provide the link between high real wages and unemployment. In addition, excessive real wage growth had adverse effects on investment. This helps to explain the failure of Britain and Germany to benefit from the catch-up possibilities opened up by rapid U.S. productivity growth.;1995;Real Wages, Productivity, and Unemployment in Britain and Germany during the 1920′s;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Brown, John C.;This article reappraises export performance on international markets before World War I by examinnig the case of cotton textiles. The German industry expanded its market share from the 1850s to 1914 despite remaining a high-cost industry relative to Great Britain. Evidence from contemporary accounts and analysis of trade data from 1913 suggests that German success arose in part from the importance of monopolistic competition in export markets for finished cloth. Germany???s relative wealth, geographic position, and perhaps the intensive marketing efforts of its industry may have enabled it to counter the cost advantage of its British rival.Their heads are still gay with crimson kerchiefs, but those kerchiefs do not come from Manchester.???E.

Butkiewicz, James L.;This paper investigates the impact of the RFC′s (Reconstruction Finance Corporation) lending to banks prior to the financial crisis of 1933. The RFC is found to have played a positive role in reducing bank failures and improving monetary conditions prior to the financial collapse. However, publication of the names of RFC loan recipients beginning in late August 1932 is found to offset the positive impact of the initial RFC lending. Empirical evidence also shows that RFC loans reduced bank failures independent of the monetary expansion that occurred in mid-1932.

There have been numerous allegations of failure in the literature, many of which relate to the late 19th century, where it is alleged that the banks became increasingly conservative. We use market data on bank share prices and returns as a means of assessing whether these institutions did indeed become more conservative, as measured by the volatility of bank returns vis-á-vis the volatility of industrial equity returns. Our study provides no support for the view that British banks became increasingly conservative form the mid-1880′s onwards.;1995;British Bank Conservatism in the Late 19th Century;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Costa, Dora L.;Explanations for the decline in labor force participation rates of older men prior to 1950 have focused on the sectoral shift from agriculture to manufacturing in part because labor force participation rates of men living in farm households have been consistently higher than those of men living in nonfarm households. I argue that, at the beginning of the 20th century, men, who were farmers were no less likely to retire than nonfarmers. Past researchers, who examined cross-sectional data, were misled because retired farmers often migrated from their farms.

Substantial new data are new added to the Mettas-Daget data set to yield evidence of 13,000 slaving voyages, of which 1800 have sufficient information for an analysis of total factor productivity. The main findings are that English slave traders were more efficient than their French counterparts. Much of this difference is associated with speedier voyages.

"Evans, Lewis T.; Quigley, Neil C.";Perron (Econometrica 57(6), 1361-1401, 1989) argued that macroeconomic time series containing unit roots may be modeled as a linear deterministic trend with structural breaks at the points where (rare) exogenous shocks with permanent effects impact on the economy. The Inwood and Stengos (Explorations in Economic History 28, 274-286, 1991) application of this approach suggested that the wheat boom, WWI, and WWII resulted in permanent exogenous shocks to the Canadian economy, but the Great Depression and the oil price shocks did not. We outline some of the theoretical and historical shortcomings associated with segmented trend representations of time series and show that they can be used to support a large number of alternative (contradictory) hypotheses about the Canadian economy.

This paper tests this sequence with monthly data using the structural VAR methodology. It is found that the links between gold flows and domestic monetary variables like interest rates or base money are statistically very significant, and it is suggested that expectations played an important stabilizing role there. This link was small in magnitude, so that gold flows were usually not a major source of disturbance in domestic activity. However, exceptional rises in the interest rate, like in the 1906-1907 crisis, may have substantially depressed domestic activity.;1995;Monetary Policy in England 1893-1914: A Structural VAR Analysis;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Johnson, H. Clark;The dissertation argues for a distinction between two varieties of price deflation, one offset by declining costs, the other induced by declining profits. Where the second type of deflation occurs, the usual result is contraction of output, income, and employment. We can roughly measure the relative amounts of cost and profit deflation underway in different situations. Price declines usually aggravate profit downturns, and in some cases directly cause them. An international profit deflation that (except for its milder consequences) anticipated that of 1929 to 1932 occurred during 1891 to 1896.;1995;The Gold Deflation, France, and the Coming of the Depression, 1919???1932;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

In this book, which has the heavy bibliographical armor of the genre and 40 pages of appendices too, John Powelson reports on his quest. He claims to have found in a concept called ???power diffusion??? a significant part of the answer to two related questions: why did the modem economy first appear in northwestern Europe and Japan, and what characteristics of those regions account for their ability to sustain economic growth? Growth is to him the serendipitous outcome of seemingly unconnected events, and he defines sustained growth as that which lasts a century or more.;1995;Uneven World Development;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Kantor, Shawn Everett;Steven Hahn, in his influential book The Roots of Southern Populism, viewed Populism in the Georgia Up-country as the culmination of a long-standing protest against the economic and social effects of commercialization in regions that were relatively isolated prior to the Civil War. In developing his explanation for the rise of Populism, Hahn emphasized the close relationship between voting for Populism in the 1890s and voting to keep the range open in the 1880s. The traditional agricultural practice in the South through the Civil War was to allow animals to roam the countryside freely and to force farmers to erect fences around their crops.;1995;Supplanting the Roots of Southern Populism: The Contours of Political Protest in the Georgia Hills;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Khan, B. Zorina;Economic development depends on the establishment of appropriate institutions, such as a patent system that defends property rights in inventions. Skeptics argue that patents in early America were unenforceable because judges arbitrarily ruled against patentees. I examine 795 patent cases to assess the role of the courts and find that judges protected patent rights because they believed that inventors were motivated by expected returns. Although changes occurred in the 1850s, the courts consistently upheld the view that the patent system fostered economic growth. If inventive activity indeed responded to material incentives, this finding implies that the legal system stimulated technical change by reinforcing the effectiveness of the patent system.The laws of the United States are extremely favorable to the division of property.???Alexis de Tocqueville, Democracy in America;1995;Property Rights and Patent Litigation in Early Nineteenth-Century America;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Kiesling, L. Lynne;Problems of poverty are exacerbated by uncertainty.1 This uncertainty means that one role of an income-assistance system is insurance, which in the modern world has often taken the form of government welfare or unemployment insurance. However, various private methods have also been important. The episode known as the Lancashire cotton famine reveals this institutional diversity in a region with a dominant geographically concentrated industry. A cyclical downturn in the cotton textile industry coincided with the Union blockade of Southern ports during the American Civil War, bringing four years of distress to the towns in the cotton manufacturing district concentrated in Lancashire. The unanticipated and unprecedented depth and duration of this shock unveiled both the responses of preexisting income assistance institutions and the institutional change that occurred to spread income losses after the cotton famine struck.;1995;Collective Action and Assisting the Poor: The Political Economy of Income Assistance During the Lancashire Cotton Famine;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Kool, Clemens J.M.;Short-term nominal interest rates in the United States and the UK experienced a structural change from stationary to nonstationary processes somewhere in the period 1914-1918. The most popular story thus far- based on switching-regression techniques-is that the founding of the Federal Reserve in November 1914 caused a simultaneous shift in both countries in early 1915. I use a recursive Bayesian method to show that this conclusion is flawed and the standard method lacks robustness. My results suggest a switch to nonstationary in late 1915 for the UK and in late 1917 for the United States related to the start of interest targeting in each country after entry into World War I and the consequent need for cheap finance of military expenditures.;1995;War Finance and Interest Rate Targeting: Regime Changes in 1914-1918;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

This paper attempts to explain the historical episodes of inconvertibility as a consequence of the interplay between government spending and seigniorage. The evidence does not seem to contradict this explanation. Empirical findings reveal a significant effect of shocks to government spending on the rate of seigniorage. Furthermore, there is evidence that the connection between inflation and government financing decisions was the basic determinant of the drachma/French franc exchange rate crises in the past century.;1995;Government Spending, Monetary Policies, and Exchange Rate Regime Switches: The Drachma in the Gold Standard Period;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

It compares collusion in three closely related markets: salt, bromine, and bleach. Where national distributors with well-established reputations had facilitated the entry of small producers into integrated markets, distributors could also facilitate collusion. Mass-producing entrants, like Dow, joined collusive distribution arrangements while improving their innovative production processes. In the longer run, they integrated forward to escape the output restrictions and arms-length relationship with customers imposed by collusive agreements.;1995;Mass Production Conquers the Pool: Firm Organization and the Nature of Competition in the Nineteenth Century;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Examination of slave-price data shows that, when allowance is made for movements in prices of trade goods bartered for slaves, real slave prices fell sharply between 1807 and 1820 but that the fall was confined to West Africa. In West Central Africa prices remained steady before 1820. Thereafter, prices rose strongly in both areas, and between 1830 and 1850 prices were generally close to the levels reached between 1783 and 1807, the height of the Atlantic slave trade.;1995;British Abolition and its Impact on Slave Prices Along the Atlantic Coast of Africa, 1783???1850;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Murray, John E.;Membership decisions within Shaker communal societies were influenced by both religious belief and economic incentives. Equal compensation for all members created incentives for low marginal product people to enter and high marginal product people to exit. Marginal productivity is related to human capital, which is expressed here by signature literacy. Initial literacy rates among both men and women were very high. New entrants tended to be less literate than both established Shakers and people in nearby areas. Among established members, by mid 19th century the literate were more likely to exit than the illiterate. Ultimately, the proportion of illiterate members grew at a time of decreasing regional illiteracy, affecting Shaker approaches to business, technology, and worship.;1995;Human Capital in Religious Communes: Literacy and Selection of Nineteenth Century Shakers;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

For purposes of measurement the first index can in principle be equated (within tolerable limits of accuracy) with the real annual expenditures on research and development as recorded (at least for recent times) in governmental, corporate, company, and other accounts. Alas, for years before 1914 national or even industry-wide research and development expenditures are very rarely recorded in a form that might allow for the construction of an index number.;1995;There Is Nothing Outside the Text, and There Is No Safety in Numbers: A Reply to Sullivan;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

A nine-sector general equilibrium model of the Australian economy in the 1930′s is formulated and some counterfactual simulations are carried out using the model. The results tend to suggest that the evaporation of the capital inflow, which reduced domestic investment, and the fall in export prices, which worsened the terms of trade, are the leading factors in the Australian depression. These findings square with Boehm′s assertion that the depression was an uncommon economic experience imposed on Australia′s usual business cycle by the collapse of the international economy.;1995;The Causes of the Depression in Australia in the 1930′s: A General Equilibrium Evaluation;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

We argue that a primary motive for the tax cuts of the 1920s was the desire to reduce the tax avoidance by wealthier individuals that occurred as a result of the previous tax rate increases and that the tax cuts enacted did reduce tax avoidance.;1995;Federal Personal Income Tax Policy in the 1920s;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Mills use a segmented quadratic-trend model of industrial production and find that the trend rate of growth accelerated in 1776.2 In addition, my own research has revealed trend acceleration for industrial-level patented invention in the 1760-to-1790 period, which is consistent with Joel Mokyr???s argument that the essence of the Industrial Revolution was a cluster of pivotal ???macroinventions??? made in this period.3;1995;Patent Counts and Textile Invention: A Comment on Griffiths, Hunt, and O???Brien;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Troesken, Werner;Before passage of the Sherman Act, states sometimes dissolved industrial combinations through the use of quo warranto proceedings. This paper examines the efficacy of one of these results - the breakup of the Chicago Gas Trust in 1889. The breakup had a negligible effect on market structure and performance. Although the dissolution of the Gas Trust reduced the market value of Chicago gas securities by about a third, producers later recouped virtually all of these losses. Also, accounting data indicate that the costs of production did not rise after the breakup. Finally, controlling for industry-wide shocks, gas prices in Chicago did not fall after 1989.;1995;Antitrust Regulation before the Sherman Act: The Break-up of the Chicago Gas Trust Company;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Tunzelmann, G. N. von;In this paper, the course of technical progress in the well known case of the cotton industry during the English Industrial Revolution is reinterpreted as being directed by time-saving technological change. In this interpretation, such heuristics generate outcomes that may variously save labor, working and fixed capital, and/or land. It is shown that in all the major subprocesses from preparation through to finishing, time-saving changes were especially prominent. It is thus argued that technological opportunities and constraints as defined by such heuristics were more significant than orthodox economic explanations for the evolution of technology at this time.;1995;Time-Saving Technical Change: The Cotton Industry in the English Industrial Revolution;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The tax records reveal substantial diversity in income among taxpayers despite the exemptions given privileged landowners.

Marital fertility was high at all income levels. These classic Malthusian patterns were found at the household level more than a generation after the last great subsistence crises and resulted in a much higher local rate of replacement for the better-off families.;1995;Family Income, Mortality, and Fertility on the Eve of the Demographic Transition: A Case Study of Rosny-Sous-Bois;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

However, researchers have uncovered a number of puzzles that are not explained by these models. Such anomalies include the excess volatility of stock prices, the closed-end mutual fund paradox, and the mean reversion in stock prices that produces predictable returns for long holding periods.1 Whereas financial economists all recognize the existence of these puzzles, they disagree about how they can be explained. Robert J. Shiller argues, for example, that efficient-markets models cannot hope to explain these anomalies and looks to alternatives that incorporate fads.2 In contrast, John H.

Williamson, Jeffrey G.;Debate over the economic convergence of currently industrialized nations has suffered a number of shortcomings. First, the underlying data base has typically been limited to Angus Maddison′s GNP and GNP per worker-hour estimates. This paper offers a new data base, purchasing-power-parity-adjusted real wage rates for unskilled labor. Second, the debate has typically focused on end points from the 19th century to the present, paying little attention to differential behavior in four distinct regimes: 1830 to midcentury, midcentury to World War I, the interwar decades, and the post-World War II experience. Third, with some recent exceptions, the search for explanations has focused primarily on technological advance, while ignoring the potential role of global factor and commodity market integration (and disintegration). The new real wage data base confirms some old stylized facts and offers some new ideas. It also points out how these four regimes differed. They differed enough to suggest that different explanations will be necessary.;1995;The Evolution of Global Labor Markets since 1830: Background Evidence and Hypotheses;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

This loss of revenue makes the Crown's Preference for the encomienda curious.

"Bauernfeind, Walter; Woitek, Ulrich";Price series of agricultural products are one of the few types of time series available for the description of economic activity in the preindustrial world. Therefore, they have always attracted the interest of economic historians dealing with this period. In addition to newly constructed time series of rye prices in an important economic region in preindustrial Europe, we present corresponding data on grain output based on tithe statistics. The data are analyzed using new univariate and multivariate spectral techniques. The main finding is that the price series exhibit genuine cyclical movements, which can be explained to a large extent as harvest cycles. The cycles vary over the period under consideration. The existence of similar patterns in grain price data developed by others as well as the correlation of prices in various regions of Germany is demonstrated.;1996;Agrarian Cycles in Germany 1339–1670: A Spectral Analysis of Grain Prices and Output in Nuremberg;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Bodenhorn, Howard; Haupert, Michael";In recent years a number of papers have appeared offering explanations of the long-noted, long-unresolved note issue paradox in both the free and national banking eras. Some have argued that previous profit calculations overstate the true cost of note issue because they fail to account for risks and costs that are not easily modeled. Others have argued that profit calculations are reasonably accurate and demonstrate that the bankers acted irrationally in failing to reap easily gathered profits. Yet another approach radically modified the basis of the calculation and found potential profits to be quite small. This note offers an explanation overlooked by most previous studies: that although note issue was profitable, a more profitable avenue existed. Because of legal and institutional restrictions, banks found it more profitable at the margin to create deposits rather than issue notes in extending credit.;1996;The Note Issue Paradox in the Free Banking Era;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Examination of data from nine widely different capital-importing countries, using a model inspired by the Capital Asset Pricing Model, reveals that countries with poor records of adherence were charged considerably more than those with good records, enough to explain the determined effort to stay on gold made by a number of capital-importing countries.;1996;The Gold Standard as a ???Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval???;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Burnette, Joyce;In the unskilled labor market of Industrial Revolution Britain, there was a distinct division of labor between the sexes. This occupational sorting may have been caused by gender discrimination, but, because men and women had different comparative advantages, it could also have been produced by a competitive market. This paper attempts to determine whether the division of labor resulted from discrimination in the form of occupational crowding by testing whether men and women were substitutes. Data on the employment of English farm servants in 1770 indicate that employers were willing to substitute male and female workers, which implies that the division of labor between the sexes was influenced by economic motivations, and was not determined by gender ideology alone.;1996;Testing for Occupational Crowding in Eighteenth-Century British Agriculture;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Carty, Lea V.;A pattern of higher interest rates in the South and West of the postbellum United States has been well established in the literature. Kenneth Snowden has examined their effects on home and farm mortgages (1987a). Lance Davis has tracked similar patterns in bank-financed projects (1965). This work complements that of Snowden and Davis by establishing that similar interest rate premia existed in the railroad bond market—the most institutionally mature capital market of the era. Hence a broad range of investment opportunities of the era were subject to capital market imperfections. In this paper I examine the offering yields of long-term, railroad bonds issued from 1876 to 1890. I use a risk-neutral model of a bond's value that incorporates both the likelihood and severity of default to solve for the interest rate premia paid by the South and West—0.97 and 1.02%, respectively.;1996;Regional Interest Rate Premia in the American Railroad Bond Market from 1876 to 1890;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Costa, Dora L.;I use Body Mass Index (BMI) to investigate how the ralationship between health status and retirement among older men has changed since 1900. Although BMIs for the elderly were much less healthy in 1900 than today, the BMI level that maximizes labor force participation rates has not changed. However, in 1900 the elasticity of nonparticipation with respect to BMI was greater than it is today, suggesting that health is now less important to the retirement decision than in the past. Other factors (especially rising income) are more important than health in explaining the historical changes in retirement rates.;1996;Health and Labor Force Participation of Older Men, 1900???1991;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Emery, J.C.Herbert;Before 1930 fraternal societies were the principal source of sickness and health insurance for American and Canadian white males. Thereafter, employer and government insurance displaced fraternal societies from primacy in the field. Critics attributed this transition to unsound fraternal pricing practices. The evidence considered here refutes that claim. Despite their hazardous pricing practices, British Columbia lodges of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows faced little risk of bankruptcy from high claims during the period 1891 to 1929.

Federico, Giovanni;The paper presents and estimates an econometric model of world silk production from 1870 to 1913, which takes into account the world demand and the supply of the three main exporters—Italy, China, and Japan. The demand curve increased as much as the income of the “core” countries did, and the performance of the producing countries was on the whole pretty good. Their supply increased as much as the demand, keeping real prices of silk stable while world trade trebled. Productivity increased in all three countries, but Japan ranked first by far, Italy second, and China trailed well behind the other two. These different performances account for the long-run changes in the respective market shares.;1996;An Econometric Model of World Silk Production, 1870–1914;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Fishback, Price V.; Kantor, Shawn Everett";In the early 1910s state governments debated the private versus public underwriting of workers' compensation risk. The choices they made established the existing system today and set the stage for later debates over the government's underwriting of unemployment, health, and disability risks. This article offers both quantitative and case-study analyses of states' original choices between public and private insurance. Monopoly state funds were adopted in some states because of an unusual combination of strong unions and weak insurance and agricultural interests. In other states, the emergence of progressive political coalitions played the decisive role.;1996;The Durable Experiment: State Insurance of Workers' Compensation Risk in the Early Twentieth Century;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Flandreau, Marc;In this paper, we lay the foundations of bullion points theory in the context of exchange rate analysis between bimetallic and monometallic nations. The theory is then applied to the study of the Paris–London exchange rates between 1846 and 1870. In particular, we show that both the position and spread of bullion points between monometallic and bimetallic nations reacted endogenously to shocks on international gold and silver markets. The distance between the upper and lower specie points tended to shrink when large disequilibria occurred on world bullion markets, and to expand when these disequilibria receded. Second, we show that bullion points constrictions and dilations as well as exchange rate movements triggered specie flows in and out of France, as a way to stabilize initial imbalances. France acted as the arbitrageur of last resort between the gold and silver segments of the international monetary system, and this in turn placed a substantial amount of “endogenous” pressure on its monetary system.;1996;Adjusting to the Gold Rush: Endogenous Bullion Points and the French Balance of Payments 1846–1870;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Flandreau, Marc;This article attempts to provide a new view of how the bimetallic standard was maintained before 1873 and how it came to change into a monometallic gold standard between 1870 and 1880. The conventional view that the gold standard emerged out of the contradictions of bimetallism is not persuasive. Instead, this article claims that bimetallism might have survived and provides an alternative explanation of the emergence of the gold standard. Political and historical factors proved essential in precipitating the uncoordinated emergence of the international gold standard.;1996;The French Crime of 1873: An Essay on the Emergence of the International Gold Standard, 1870???1880;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Gazeley, Ian; Rice, Patricia";The traditional view that the Great Depression of 1930–1932 arose from a collapse in aggregate demand has been challenged recently by economists who argue that the fundamental causes lay on the supply side of the market. This paper examines these issues in the context of the shipbuilding industry. A model of the determination of price, output, and employment is developed and estimated using quarterly data for the industry. The results support the view that a negative demand shock in the form of a sharp fall in the volume of world trade led to the sharp decline in output. In the case of shipbuilding, the impact on employment was exacerbated by nominal wage developments.;1996;Wages and Employment in Britain between the Wars: Quarterly Evidence from the Shipbuilding Industry;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Geib-Gundersen, Lisa; Zahrt, Elizabeth";A debate has recently been re-ignited over the pace of long-run productivity growth in nineteenth-century agriculture. Before 1966 the view was one of accelerated productivity over the course of the century, and this view was confirmed by the statistics on farm gross product published in 1960 by Marvin Towne and Wayne Rasmussen. The appearance in 1966 of Stanley Lebergott's labor force series changed this traditional perspective. When combined with Towne and Rasmussen's output figures, Lebergott's figures suggested that productivity growth was slower after the Civil War than before, calling into question the more plausible pattern of postbellum increases. A few historians were skeptical of these new findings, but were unable to dispute the seemingly solid foundation upon which they were built. Finally in 1993, Thomas Weiss argued that the skeptics were in fact correct to be wary of Lebergott's revisions.;1996;A New Look at U.S. Agricultural Productivity Growth, 1800???1910;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Glahn, Richard von;The impact of China's demand for silver on global trade in specie and monetary metals during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries remains poorly understood. Conventional wisdom postulates that seventeenth-century China became so dependent on foreign silver to sustain domestic economic growth that a sharp fall in silver imports in the 1640s led to the fall of the Ming dynasty in 1644. This hypothesis rests on dubious theoretical and empirical grounds. The demand for silver in China was determined by long-term changes in indigenous demand for money rather than short-term fluctuations in the flow of silver imports.;1996;Myth and Reality of China's Seventeenth-Century Monetary Crisis;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Gratton, Brian;Progressive Ear and New Deal reformers claimed that industrialization impoverished the elderly by degrading older workers. This has become the standard interpretation in popular and scholarly accounts. Data from 1890 through 1950 show that real wages of older workers rose sharply during this peroid and that family economic strategies promised the elderly considerable security. Birth cohort analysis indicates positive age-earnings profiles across the life cycle. Although the elderly benefited from economic growth, security in old age often demanded intrafamilial exchanges. Tensions arising from these transfers may explain the broad popular support Social Security received.;1996;The Poverty of Impoverishment Theory: The Economic Well-Being of the Elderly, 1890???1950;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Gregson, Mary Eschelbach;It is well known that early settlers on the frontier reaped the benefits of development as population grew, especially through capital gains on real estate. But population turnover—so pervasive in the rural north in the nineteenth century as well as in contemporary settlement economies—also afforded early settlers an advantage: they knew local soil and market conditions better than those who settled later. Such location-specific human capital augmented the incomes, and therefore the wealth, of early settlers. Early settlers in Missouri had higher rates of wealth accumulation than later arrivals, and the contribution of location-specific human capital was at least equal to the contribution of capital gains.;1996;Wealth Accumulation and Distribution in the Midwest in the Late Nineteenth Century;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Guinnane, Timothy W.; Miller, Ronald I.";Tenant-right, or a tenant's right to sell his holding, was one of the most puzzling institutions of nineteenth-century Irish land tenure. Historians have argued that the institution reflects the tenants' assertions of a proprietary interest in the land, an assertion often backed up by threats and violence. In this article we argue that landlords respected tenant-right because they could profit from the instistution. Our model reflects comments by contemporaries and explains that tenant-right functioned as a bond aganist nonpayment of rent and was part of a rational landlord's income-maximizing strategy.;1996;Bonds without Bondsmen: Tenant-Right in Nineteenth-Century Ireland;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Hamilton, Barton; MacKinnon, Mary";This paper uses a sample of employee records from the Canadian Pacific Railway to study changes between 1903 and 1938 in the composition of job separations, and the probability of separation. The proportion of voluntary departures fell by more than half after World War I. Independent competing risk, piecewise-constant hazard functions for the probabilities of quits and layoffs are estimated. Changes in workforce composition lengthened the average worker's spell, but a worker with any given set of characteristics was much more likely to be laid off after 1921, although many of these layoffs were only temporary.;1996;Quits and Layoffs in Early Twentieth Century Labor Markets;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Hamilton, Gillian;This paper examines the nature of apprenticing arrangements in Montreal around the turn of the nineteenth century, using apprenticeship contracts from a larger body of notarial records found in Quebec. The principal question addressed is what determined apprenticeship length? I find that the characteristics of both masters and their boys were important. For example, older (more productive) boys served shorter terms, as did those training under masons and butchers. There is also evidence that the precision of a master's estimate of a boy's future value was important. Masters often relied on probationary periods to better gauge a boy's worth before signing a contract. Probations, all else equal, were associated with shorter contracts. Because masters anticipated fewer “failures” when they were better informed, matches which began with probations were associated with apprentices of higher expected value.;1996;The Market for Montreal Apprentices: Contract Length and Information;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Hanes, Christopher;A modern household's consumption bundle is more finished than that of a typical worker in the past: the average consumption good passes through more stages of production before purchase. This has affected the cyclical behavior of wages relative to the price of the consumption bundle because wages are more procyclical relative to prices of more-finished goods. Nowadays real consumption wages are procyclical. They were less procyclical before the Second World War, and they may have been acyclical or even countercyclical before the First World War.;1996;Changes in the Cyclical Behavior of Real Wage Rates, 1870???1990;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Hanes, Christopher;In the eighteenth-century British Empire and the antebellum South, slaves were concentrated in domestic service and rural enterprises like agriculture and ironworks. I argue that employers in these sectors chose to employ slaves rather than free labor because they faced especially high turnover costs???that is, costs of searching for a worker and going without labor when a free worker quit or was fired. In the absence of slavery, these sectors were marked by other institutions designed to deal with turnover costs: indentured servitude, employment agencies, and deferred compensation.;1996;Turnover Cost and the Distribution of slave Labor in Anglo-America;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Hanson II, John R.;Robert Lucas, Richard Easterlin, and others hold that lack of human capital, especially in the sense of formal education and training, explains why poor countries traditionally have received so little capital and technology from rich countries. The evidence presented here is consistent with a significant role for human capital, but it also suggests that Lucas and Easterlin underrate other influences on capital and technology flows, especially political risk and institutional incompatibility among countries. In addition, countries may be denied investment because investors do not respect personal qualities of workers, particularly in Asia.;1996;Human Capital and Direct Investment in Poor Countries;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Hartley, James E.; Sheffrin, Steven M.; Vasche, J.

Horrell, Sara;Household budget studies are used to assess working-class demand for manufactures over industrialization. Contrary to demand-side proponents, increased urbanization, enhanced opportunities for women's and children's work, and a declining subsistence sector all retrenched consumption patterns into demand for the products of traditional industries and decreased demand for the products of new manufacturing industries. However, consideration of national expenditure on necessities shows an increasing surplus available for discretionary expenditure between 1801 and 1841. This reflects an increased purchasing power of the middle and upper classes that may have manifested itself as substantially increased demand for domestic manufactures.;1996;Home Demand and British Industrialization;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Kanazawa, Mark T.;Early federal policies for disposal of public lands underwent significant changes in the first 40 years of their existence. Though the first policies established around 1800 called for sales of public lands based on competitive auction bidding, by the 1830s this system had been importantly supplanted by the policy of preemption, which legitimated the claims of squatters and freed them from competition for their lands. This paper examines the political economy of public land disposal from 1789 to 1830 and documents how squatters helped bring about this policy change: both by disrupting the operation of the auction system and by applying political pressure for favorable land policies. The paper also reports the results of an econometric analysis of congressional roll-call voting which provides insight into the nature of the political coalitions that formed in support of passage of the first general preemption act of 1830.;1996;Possession is Nine Points of the Law: The Political Economy of Early Public Land Disposal;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Keefer, Philip;Infrastructure construction is often associated with excessive, even corrupt, profits.

It also makes the first attempt to document excess construction profits in Spanish railroads by demonstrating, for example, financial links between railroad stockholders and the providers of construction goods and services and by directly estimating construction profits. The estimated excess construction profits only provided railroad entrepreneurs with a normal rate of return to their entire railroad-related investments.;1996;Protection Against a Capricious State: French Investment and Spanish Railroads, 1845???1875;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Khan, B. Zorina;Nineteenth-century laws granted wives previously withheld rights to their own property and earnings as well as liability for debts and contracts. I use 4,198 women's patents to assess whether these laws encouraged greater female commercial activity. Patentees were motivated by potential profits and were responsive to market incentives. Women's patenting jumped significantly in states with legal reforms and was lowest in states without such laws. Much of the subsequent increase occurred in metropolitan centers where property rights were of greater concern. Thus, by reducing transactions costs and increasing expected benefits, legal reforms arguably stimulated women's investments in patenting and commercial activities.;1996;Married Women's Property Laws and Female Commercial Activity: Evidence from United States Patent Records, 1790???1895;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Kiesling, L. Lynne;This paper augments previous research on the use of public relief as insurance during industrial downturns by looking at the timing of movement to public relief over the course of the Lancashire cotton famine (1861–1865). Able-bodied workers and their non-able-bodied counterparts, some of whom were the relatives of able-bodied workers, used public relief only as an assistance institution of final recourse, requesting it with a lag relative to the onset of the distress. The comovement of able-bodied and non-able-bodied recipients to public relief suggests a prevalent culture of income smoothing between the two groups and demonstrates the importance of informal assistance in the implicit labor contract in textile manufacturing.;1996;Institutional Choice Matters: The Poor Law and Implicit Labor Contracts in Victorian Lancashire;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Kinghorn, Janice Rye; Nye, John Vincent C.";We use census data and information on large firms to generate descriptions of structural features of Western industry around 1906.

Equally startling, French levels of plant size and concentration are comparable to those of the United States.

"Koppl, Roger; Yeager, Leland B.";We present a theory of asset pricing in which discretionary actions of “Big Players” encourage herding and irrational bubbles, thus weakening the tendency of asset prices to equal their rationally expected present values.

We test the theory using qualitative and numerical data from an important episode in Russian monetary history. The use of Benoit Mandelbrot'sR/Sanalysis, a statistical technique appropriate to the study of long-memory processes, supports our claims about herding and martingales. Our results weaken the case for present value models and strengthen the case for noise-trader models.

Levenstein, Margaret C.;This paper uses documentary records of the bromine cartel from 1885 to 1914 to evalu ate the contributions of noncooperative, repeated game models of collusion to our under standing of the determinants of cartel success and the causes of price wars. It finds that many of the variables that determine an industry’s ability to collude in these models—the discount rate, the information structure, the ability to design rewards and punishments, the beliefs and expectations of participants—were significant determinants of collusive success in the bromine industry as well as other late 19th century industries. It questions the explanation of price wars offered by these models that price wars are equilibrium punishments, implemented because of problems of imperfect monitoring. In 19th century industries, price wars were more likely to result from bargaining or coordination problems. Price wars resulting from imperfect monitoring tended to be short and shallow. As the bromine industry became more concentrated and gained experience working cooperatively, the cartel collected more information and developed alternative punishments to make the use of price war punishments even less likely.;1996;Do Price Wars Facilitate Collusion?

Lewis, Frank D.;The Declaration of Principles signed by Israel and the PLO in 1993 has given urgency to the compensation of refugees who were displaced by the 1948 war. This paper addresses one aspect of the issue, namely the value of the agricultural property abandoned by the Palestinians. Using data on agricultural output and land ownership, imputed land income is derived and then capitalized, giving losses that range from $2.2 to $2.6 billion (1993 $U.S.), or about 4% of 1993 Israeli GDP. These are more than twice the estimates of the U.N. Conciliation Commission for Palestine made in the early 1950s.

Lindert, Peter H.;The forces that are most likely to set the ultimate limits on social spending as a share of GDP are not those usually imagined.

They also reveal substantial convergence within the South Atlantic and South Central regions, suggesting the emergence of a unified southern labor market.

Many observers attribute the relationship to the rise of urban factories or improvements in transportation. We believe that information-based human capital, particularly as embodied in business professionals, provides a better explanation for the growth of cities. Cities grew because concentrated human capital raised productivity. In a study of English cities from 1861 to 1961 we found that cities whose work forces contained high proportions of business professionals grew more rapidly.

Wahl, Jenny Bourne;An analysis of all appellate cases involving slave-sales reveals that southern courts helped minimize the costs of trading in slaves. Slave-sales law also surpassed other contemporaneous commercial law in sophistication. Why? Greater information gaps between slave buyers and sellers called for more complex institutional support. The enormous property value embodied by slaves also led to more litigation, greater need for settled law, and a more even match of power between plaintiff and defendant. Additionally, legal rules surrounding slave sales substituted for the employment law governing free-labor markets.;1996;The Jurisprudence of American Slave Sales;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Weber, Ernst Juerg;During the Middle Ages, the medium of exchange function of money was separate from the unit of account function.

The joint behavior of the pound price of gold, the pound price of silver, and the silver–gold ratio in Basle between 1365 and 1429 cannot be reconciled with the notion that nominal values were autonomous. Instead, the monetary system was based on a silver standard, supplemented by gold coins whose money of account values were determined by this silver standard.;1996;“Imaginary” or “Real” Moneys of Account in Medieval Europe?

Simulations show that farm marketings would have been substantial and growth would have been rapid if the investment boom of the 1930s had been pursued within the marketing framework of the NEP. However, collectivization did accelerate industrialization by increasing the rate of rural–urban migration.;1997;Agricultural Marketing and the Possibilities for Industrialization in the Soviet Union in the 1930s;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Allen, Robert C.;In Egypt, state formation occurred much more rapidly after the adoption of farming than in many other parts of the ancient Near East. Furthermore, the Egyptian state lasted longer and was more stable than most Empires established elsewhere. This paper argues that successful states in the ancient world depended on the ability of elites to extract a surplus from farmers and other producers. This ability was greatest when the population was immobile. The success of the Pharaohs was due to the geography of Egypt—the deserts bordering the Nile meant that habitation was confined to the valley. Farmers could flee tax or rent collectors only along the river. The population control problem was, thus, simpler than elsewhere and was the reason a unified state was created and lasted for millenia.;1997;Agriculture and the Origins of the State in Ancient Egypt;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Benjamin, Dwayne; Brandt, Loren";Drawing on a unique household-level data set from northeast China in the 1930s, this paper explores the connections between the distribution of land, factor markets, and income distribution. We test whether patterns of income inequality were consistent with the predictions of a market-clearing, neoclassical model linking land and labor endowments, through factor markets to household income. While the model is consistent with some features in the data, we reject the hypothesis that factor markets worked perfectly and find support for the historian's intuition regarding the disproportionate impact of land inequality in the countryside. Nevertheless, where markets were more active, especially land rental markets, excess returns to land were diminished and inequality was lowest. This suggests that factor market development played a positive role in reducing inequality in rural China.;1997;Land, Factor Markets, and Inequality in Rural China: Historical Evidence;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Booth, Alan; Melling, Joseph; Dartmann, Christoph";This article reviews Mancur Olson???s ideas concerning the impact of institutions on growth rates and national competitive performance. We suggest that Olson???s ???ideal typical??? methodology limits the usefulness of his approach and that institutional structures and strategies can be dependent variables. In comparing the performance of three European countries in the postwar period, we argue (contrary to strict Olsonian principles) that changing market and political environments helped to determine the kind of institutional forms that emerged. We question the weight that Olson places on the role of institutional structures and strategies on long-run economic performance.;1997;Institutions and Economic Growth: The Politics of Productivity in West Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, 1945???1955;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Boyer, George R.;This paper examines the determinants of migration from 19 southern counties to six major destinations in England and Wales from 1861–70 to 1891–1900. I find that, while the size of origin-destination wage gaps and the distance between origin and destination areas were important determinants of migration flows, as expected, migration was also strongly influenced by the number of previous migrants from an origin county living in a destination. The assistance provided by previous migrants to friends and relatives contemplating migration led to a perpetuation of earlier migration patterns, and helps to explain the continued dominance of London as a destination for migrants in the 1890s.;1997;Labour migration in southern and eastern England, 1861-1901;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Boyer, George R.;This paper presents new evidence concerning the importance of poor relief as a source of income assistance for unemployed operatives during the Lancashire cotton famine. My comparison of weekly data on the number of relief recipients in 23 distressed poor law unions with estimates of weekly cotton consumption for the period November 1861 to December 1862 suggests that the average length of time between becoming unemployed and receiving poor relief was less than 2 months. This result is shown to be consistent with available evidence on working class saving. Given the meager amount of informal assistance available to them, most operatives were forced to turn to the poor law for income assistance within 4 to 8 weeks of becoming unemployed.;1997;Poor Relief, Informal Assistance, and Short Time during the Lancashire Cotton Famine;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Boyer, George R.; Hatton, Timothy J.";This article examines the magnitude and direction of migration flows and the effects of migration on labour market integration in Victorian England and Wales. Migration is shown to have been determined largely by economic incentives and the availability of information. A model of wage determination in agriculture is developed and estimated, showing that economic conditions in urban areas had a strong influence on short-run wage changes in agriculture. Trends in regional wage dispersion are examined, and a model of the degree of labour market integration between regions is estimated. Results show that regional labour markets were fairly loosely integrated in the short run.;1997;Migration and Labour Market Integration in Late Nineteenth-Century England and Wales;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Brinkley, Garland L.;Per capita agricultural output sharply declined in the ???Confederate States??? between 1860 and 1880. This article asserts that the decline in agricultural output was partially the result of increased disease (hookworm) brought about by substandard living conditions suffered by the Southern population during the Civil War. Skeletal remains and mortality data, ubiquitous hookworm symptoms among the Southern population, and regression analysis support this hypothesis. The econometric results strongly suggest that emancipation and increased hookworm infection were responsible for the income decline while an increase in the percentage of sharecropping tenancy arrangements increased southern productivity.;1997;The Decline in Southern Agricultural Output, 1860???1880;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Broadberry, Stephen N.;This paper sets out the evolution of Anglo-German comparative labour productivity levels since 1870, using a nine-sector disaggregation. Germany caught up with and overtook Britain in terms of aggregate labour productivity largely by shifting resources out of agriculture and improving her relative productivity position in services rather than by improving her position in manufacturing. The key role attributed by many economic historians and growth economists to technology transfer in manufacturing as a major factor driving convergence of productivity and living standards is called into question.;1997;Anglo-German productivity differences 1870-1990: A sectoral analysis;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Bryer, R. A.;"It is widely agreed that the coming of limited liability in the Joint-Stock Companies Act of 1855 marked a revolutionary change. However, this change is hard to explain because it appeared to serve no particular interest.

It argues that the commission's report presented parliament with competing analyses of limited liability from the perspectives of two very different theories of political economy: one which followed Adam Smith in arguing that unlimited liability was necessary to sustain a world fit for individual capitalists; and another which, anticipating Marx's critique of Adam Smith, argued for limited liability to create a world fit for social capital.";1997;The Mercantile Laws Commission of 1854 and the Political Economy of Limited Liability;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Campbell, Bruce M. S.;Manorial accounts allow detailed investigation of the market involvement of medieval seignorial demesnes. Production decisions taken locally emerge as strongly, if indirectly, influenced by the market. Disposal decisions, in contrast, were much more a matter of estate policy and therefore of institutional factors. Probably because of differential transaction costs, many lords preferred to provision their households directly from their estates rather than sell the bulk of their produce and purchase most of their provisions. The forces promoting commercialization within the seignorial arable sector appear to have been stronger at the opening than the close of the fourteenth century.;1997;Matching Supply to Demand: Crop Production and Disposal by English Demesnes in the Century of the Black Death;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Cherry, Steven;This article draws upon extensive data to illustrate changes in the financing of English provincial, Scottish, and London voluntary hospitals. Traditional sources of funds other than investment earnings declined, although 'windfalls' and major benefactions remained important. Among new sources, central and local government aid was limited. Workplace collections, contributory schemes, and patient payments secured the hospitals' financial position more firmly than is generally recognized,but they could not resolve longer-term problems. These new sources illustrated the changed character of voluntary hospitals, as their original philanthropic focus upon the sick poor was largely replaced by quasi-insurance arrangements and forms of payment from a wider social clientele.;1997;Before the National Health Service: Financing the Voluntary Hospitals, 1900-1939;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Clay, Karen;Within economics there has been a mounting interest in institutions. Virtually all the work to date on institutions has examined a single institution. The problem is that in many settings the performance of the institution under examination is affected by other, unexamined institutions. This paper examines the relationship between two types of private-order institutions that facilitated trade in a specific setting—Mexican California during the 1830s and 1840s. The surviving evidence suggests that a multilateral institution enabled merchants to extend credit to their retail customers, and a similar multilateral institution enabled the merchants to extend credit to one another. The relationship between these institutions makes them of particular interest. This relationship arose because local communities imposed costs on merchants that affected their trade with one another. The barriers to entry and exit posed by these costs, in turn, facilitated the operation and persistence of the institution that supported intermerchant trade. They also precluded other organizational forms such as the vertical integration of wholesalers.;1997;Trade, Institutions, and Credit;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Crafts, Nicolas F. R.;The article sets out estimates for various aspects of well-being during British industrialization. Judgements about changes in living standards are shown to be sensitive to weighting procedures. It is argued that recent participants in the famous standard of living controversy have assigned undue importance to trends in heights and that concern for quality of life rather than real wages need not imply a pessimistic view of changes in aggregate well-being during the industrial revolution. Urban mortality experience is shown to be the least satisfactory aspect of well-being and it is suggested that this reflects difficulties of financing local public goods.;1997;Some Dimensions of the 'Quality of Life' during the British Industrial Revolution;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Crafts, Nicolas F.

It is argued that relatively low life expectancy implies that the high income countries of 1870 had lower living standards than most of today's Third World but that since 1870 imputations for reductions in market work time have added more to growth than decreases in mortality. Overall, it seems clear that conventional measures of economic growth seriously understate the rate of improvement in living standards since 1870.;1997;The Human Development Index and changes in standards of living: Some historical comparisons;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Di Matteo, Livio;Wealth and asset holding in late-nineteenth-century Ontario are examined using a new data set of census-linked probated decedents. Hump-shaped wealth-age profiles are found, supporting the importance of demographic and life cycle forces in late-nineteenth-century financial asset accumulation. With financial asset holding more pronounced in Ontario than Quebec, the implication for Canadian economic development is that the differences in capital formation and industrialization across Ontario and Quebec are partly rooted in saving behavior. The results show that urbanization, occupational status, literacy, the number of children, and region of residence are important determinants of wealth and asset holding.;1997;The Determinants of the Wealth and Asset Holding in Nineteenth-Century Canada: Evidence from Microdata;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Esteban, Javier Cuenca;Ongoing research on British overseas trade does not support supply-side explanations of British industrialization. Contrary to widely publicized views, the share of British industrial exports in alternative measures of industrial output rose almost continuously throughout the period 1723 to 1851. This finding rests on the official values of British domestic exports, and it is confirmed by new annual estimates of Britain's domestic export, and it is confirmed by new annual estimates of Britain's domestic export values at current an constant prices form 1772 to 1821. Further research on prices, and on Britain's strikingly underutilized trade records, may lead to a more balanced perception of supply and demand forces during the Industrial Revolution.;1997;The Rising Share of British Industrial Exports in Industrial Output, 1700???1851;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Estevadeordal, A.;Trade policy constitutes one of the most important chapters in any economic history account of the early years of this century. To assess its impact on the economic development of individual countries we need comparative measures of protection at the sectoral level. This paper offers what appears to be the first attempt to construct such measures for 1913 based on the Heckscher-Ohlin trade model. It uses a newly constructed data set on net trade flows and factor endowments covering fourteen ‘old world’ and four ‘new world’ economies. In contrast to previous studies, the measures suggested here are, first, objective in the sense of not attempting to classify a priori the trade regime of some country based only on its tariff legislation. Second, they reflect all types of trade interventions. Third, they are constructed as continuous measures. Finally, and most importantly, they are comparable across countries and sectors.;1997;Measuring protection in the early twentieth century;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Frieden, Jeffry A.;The battle over gold is typically explained as driven by proinflation debtors. However, going off gold would also have caused a depreciation, raising tradable prices relative to nontradables prices and helping producers of exportable primary products. An analysis of Congressional votes on monetary legislation indicates that higher constituency debt levels were not associated with opposition to gold, whereas mining and agricultural production were. This suggests that gold politics was at least as much about the impact of the exchange rate on relative prices as it was about inflation of the overall price level.;1997;Monetary Populism in Nineteenth-Century America: An Open Economy Interpretation;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The effect on farm employment was to reduce it by about 54,000 (6.5 per cent) in 1929 up to a peak of 97,000 (13.3 per cent) in 1937. The minimum wage lifted out of poverty many families of farm labourers who remained employed, but it significantly lowered the incomes of farmers, particularly during the 1930s.;1997;The Origins and Early Impact of the Minimum Wage in Agriculture;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Cross-county data show that the ratio of emigration to deaths was higher in richer than in poorer counties. Another key feature of the Famine emigration was that it was irreversible. The Famine thus had a permanent impact on Ireland's population in a transitory fashion.

"Greasley, David; Oxley, Les";The return of growth theory to center stage in mainstream economics provides opportunities for historians to reconsider the forces shaping longer-term economic development. A key motivation for developing new growth modeling strategies lay in the desire to reestablish contact between theory and the empirics of economic growth. By postulating diminishing returns to capital, the traditional neoclassical paradigm precludes the sustaining of per capita growth in the absence of exogenous technological progress. Since historical records of economic development offer scant evidence for declining per capita growth, disenchantment grew with a theoretical perspective that leaves the crucial part of the empirical record unexplained, prompting a search for alternative modeling strategies.;1997;Endogenous Growth or ???Big Bang???: Two views of the First Industrial Revolution;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Using parsimonious methods, we propose an alternative view that the output series have alternating stochastic properties. Specifically we distinguish the period 1780 to 1851 as an Industrial Revolution epoch during which shocks had long-term effects. Out model simplifies to help understand the complexities of the Industrial Revolution, and we agree with Clive Granger and Zhuanxin Ding, that ???While it is correct to search over a specific set of parsimonious models ??? the model so achieved is, at best, an approximation to the truth???.;1997;Endogenous Growth, Trend Output, and the Industrial Revolution: Reply to Crafts and Mills;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Heckelman, Jac C.; WALLIS, JOHN JOSEPH";Nineteenth century state and local governments continued to invest in railroads and other internal improvement projects long after it was clear that these projects were financially very risky. This paper provides a motivation for public involvement in internal improvements by estimating the effect of railroad construction on property values from 1850 to 1910. Using Census data on true and assessed valuations, we find that the increase in property values associated with railroad construction, would, at typical levels of taxation, pay for a substantial share, if not all, of the construction costs solely on the basis of property tax revenues. The effect of construction on property values declined with mileage up to several thousand miles, which may explain why state governments typically were involved in construction of the initial systems. The effect, however, was nonlinear and increased at higher mileages, consistent with the persistent participation of county and municipal governments.;1997;Railroads and Property Taxes;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Existing price series and the price evidence as it appeared to farmers and landlords at the time are re-examined and shown to be neither clear nor consistent.

We argue that the decline in heights was caused by such economic factors as an increase in inequality, a shift to cotton production, and a rise in the relative price of nutrients, which induced households to substitute carbohydrates for animal proteins.

The observed features of disease-specific mortality and timing of death suggest that the different degrees of exposure to disease prior to enlistment were probably the main determinant of the wartime mortality differentials. Wealth had a significant effect only for diseases on which nutritional influence is definite.

We try to adjust for biases in the sources by estimating a formal model using data on industrial firms.

In explaining this development welfare provision by unions has been seriously underrated. The benefits workers expected from membership in the various insurance schemes offered were of prime importance in decisions to join or leave a union. Dutch and British unions offered a variety of welfare provisions. They were efficient suppliers of insurance-probably the most efficient in the case of unemployment insurance. When state insurance became obligatory, a prime incentive to join a union was lost, and this, in part, explains the decline in membership.;1997;Trade Unions and the Provision of Welfare in the Netherlands, 1910-1960;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Millward, Robert;This article aims to account for the 1940s nationalizations and to develop a general theme which embraces the whole of British industry. It argues that natural monopoly and externalities go a long way towards explaining why transport and fuel were taken into public ownership and why manufacturing was not. The neo-marxist characterization of capitalist society plays only a limited role. Similarly the presence of a Labour government accounts for many of the institutional arrangements, but the shift to public ownership was ultimately determined by economic factors present throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.;1997;The 1940s Nationalizations in Britain: Means to an End or the Means of Production?;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Motomura, Akira;This article presents previously unpublished Spanish Monarchy mint output and seigniorage data for the period 1597 to 1643. Spain dominated western European minting with silver and gold outputs that equaled or exceeded those of the late 16th century. After 1624, output and market share fell to lower means with greater fluctuations, apparently for war-related reasons. The Monarchy episodically issued petty money which pushed silver and gold money out of Castile. Thus, petty money issues after 1624 were mainly inflationary. The Monarchy collected significant seigniorage from both types of money. The data seem consistent with a modern quantity view of the Spanish Price Revolution.;1997;New Data on Minting, Seigniorage, and the Money Supply in Spain (Castile), 1597–1643;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Nielsen, Randall;In 1587 the English Privy Council issued its first Book of Orders for the relief of dearth, a program of grain-market control that included forced delivery of private stocks to local markets in crisis periods. The policy has been described as an effective response to irrational hoarding and credited for a significant reduction in English grain-price variance. In contrast, I find support for an alternative profit maximizing model of storage. The occurrence of similar price stabilization in other European markets in the early seventeenth century is also demonstrated, suggesting English policy was not the cause.;1997;Storage and English Government Intervention in Early Modern Grain Markets;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
O’Rourke, Kevin Hjortshøj;The article quantifies the impact of cheap grain on the European economy in the late nineteenth century. Falling transport costs led to dramatic declines in Anglo-American grain price gaps, but price convergence was less impressive between the U.S. and other European economies, and within Europe. Cheaper grain meant lower rents throughout Europe, and protection boosted rents, but the magnitudes involved differed between countries. Similarly, cheap grain increased real wages in Britain, but lowered them elsewhere. The grain invasion implied different shocks across countries, and this partly explains the varying trade policies pursued in Europe during this period.;1997;The European Grain Invasion, 1870???1913;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"O’Rourke, Kevin Hjortshøj; Williamson, Jeffrey G.";On average, the poor European periphery converged on the rich industrial core in the four or five decades prior to the First World War. Some, like the three Scandinavian economies, used industrialization to achieve a spectacular convergence on the leaders, especially in real wages and living standards. Some, like Ireland, seemed to do it without industrialization. Some, like Italy, underwent a less spectacular catch-up, and it was limited to the industrializing North. Some, like Iberia, actually fell back. What accounts for this variety? What role did trade and tariff policy play? What about emigration and capital flows? What about schooling? We offer a tentative assessment of these contending explanations and conclude that globalization was by far the dominant force accounting for convergence (and divergence) around the periphery. Some exploited it well, and some badly.;1997;Around the European periphery 1870-1913: Globalization, schooling and growth;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
O'Brien, Anthony Patrick;Producing and selling mechanically complex and expensive consumer durables involves a number of difficulties, especially if the products are manufactured in high volume. This paper focuses on the problem that companies employing high volume production methods are extremely vulnerable to the consequences of the variance in final sales across the business cycle, unless they devise methods for adjusting production to sales. Evidence is presented that it was the Ford Motor Company that first developed the methods required to ensure that production was kept in line with sales. These methods played a heretofore overlooked role in the success of Ford during its early years. General Motors was able to overtake Ford for leadership of the automobile industry only after it began to adopt similar methods, beginning in 1924.;1997;The Importance of Adjusting Production to Sales in the Early Automobile Industry;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
OFFER, AVNER;'The great transformation' from customary exchange to impersonal markets is incomplete. Reciprocal exchange pervades modem societies. It takes the form of 'gifts', reciprocated without certainty. Reciprocity is driven by the pursuit of 'regard'. Money is avoided in regard exchanges, because it is impersonal. Instead, regard signals are embodied in goods, in services, or in time (attention). The personalization of gifts authenticates the signal. Reciprocal exchange persists in family formation, in intergenerational transfers, in labour markets, in agriculture, the professions, in marketing, entrepreneurship, and also in corruption and crime. Reciprocal exchange is constrained by time and psychic energy, but is likely to persist as a preferred source of regard.;1997;Between the Gift and the Market: The Economy of Regard;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Ojala, J.;Finland offers a good opportunity to study how international trade contacts were established and how they developed. Having been denied trading rights, several Finnish ports were granted direct access to foreign trade in 1765. The hypothesis is that the old business relations with Stockholm traders, the role played by the shipmaster and the government-based consulate networks were crucial in the development of the merchant network abroad during the eighteenth century. Business networks developed from interpersonal contacts towards interorganisational relationships during the nineteenth century. The business networks were in many cases, especially in the home town and with neighbouring towns, based on kinship or family relations, and they were long-term by nature.;1997;Approaching Europe: The merchant networks between Finland and Europe during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

For almost two decades during the seventeenth century, debased European coinage circulated widely in Ottoman markets at values far above their specie content.

PEARSON, ROBIN;There has been a recent shift in the historiography of the modern British economy towards an emphasis on the success of the service sector. This article examines one criterion of success, namely innovation, in British insurance between 1700 and 1914. Factors determining innovation are surveyed and comparisons drawn with European insurance. The relevance of existing models of industrial innovation is challenged and a new model is constructed for insurance. This model suggests that insurance innovation ran broadly counter-cyclical to innovation in industry during this period, and was relatively undynamic. The article concludes by speculating about the relationship between industrial growth, liquidity constraints, and innovation in insurance.;1997;Towards an Historical Model of Services Innovation: The Case of the Insurance Industry, 1700-1914;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Quinn, Stephen;During the second half of the 17th century, London's goldsmith-bankers formed a system of banking through mutual debt acceptance and interbanker clearing. Widespread acceptance of bank notes, orders, and bills created positive externalities for member bankers and promoted the use of bank supplied media of exchange during the Financial Revolution in England. Mutual acceptance by goldsmith-bankers arose endogenously as a dominant strategy Nash equilibrium. The bilateral clearing of these acceptances produced incentive compatible co-monitoring between goldsmith-bankers. The responsiveness of co-monitoring is supported by statistical analysis of the accounts of the Restoration era goldsmith Edward Backwell. Systemic cohesion was further reinforced by the screening of new members through apprenticeship.;1997;Goldsmith-Banking: Mutual Acceptance and Interbanker Clearing in Restoration London;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Schulze, Max-Stephan;Adopting a sectoral perspective, this article is concerned with the pattern of economic growth in the late nineteenth-century Habsburg empire. The timing and extent of changes in machinery output and investment support the notion of a great depression in Austria after the 1873 stock market crash and match with the direction of capital flows. The post-1873 outflow of capital from Austria to Hungary, which was eventually reversed in the early 1890s, hampered industrial investment in the western part of the empire, and stimulated expansion in the eastern part. The evidence casts doubt on the revisionist view which postulates steady and uninterrupted growth of the Austrian economy between 1870 and 1913.;1997;The Machine-Building Industry and Austria's Great Depression after 1873;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Seltzer, Andrew J.;The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 imposed a binding minimum wage on the southern seamless hosiery and lumber industries. However, the process of adjusting to the new minimum differed across the two industries. Seamless hosiery firms substituted capital for labor and converted or replaced old machinery. Southern lumber firms employed fewer workers relative to northern and western firms, however, changes in their resource base and war-related government purchases prevented an absolute decrease in employment levels. Numerous southern lumber firms continued to pay less than minimum rates by illegally evading the act or taking advantage of the intra-stage exemption.;1997;The Effects of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 on the Southern Seamless Hosiery and Lumber Industries;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Siddle, D. J.;Migration from the mountain areas of pre-industrial Europe has been seen as the product of poverty. While hardship controlled the strategies of the more marginalized households, better placed families used their migration experience to establish themselves in commerce. Over generations they used contacts and kinship systems to develop important informal trading networks. It is difficult to establish the effects of this hidden activity on local mountain economies, but dowry payments and post mortem inventories are used to expose the impact of inflowing capital and its circulation.;1997;Migration as a Strategy of Accumulation: Social and Economic Change in Eighteenth-Century Savoy;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Simpson, James;This paper challenges the widely held view that tariff protection was the major factor in explaining the poor performance of Spanish agriculture in the half century prior to the 1936 Civil War. After examining the general level of tariffs, it is argued that these were not sufficient in themselves to explain either the poor diets or weak demand for manufactured goods. Secondly, farmers were slow to switch resources out of cereals, not so much because of the tariffs, but rather because of the limited export opportunities for alternative crops, especially olive oil and wine. Finally, the evidence suggests that those areas which saw a significant increase in the area of cereals were just as likely to see a decline in the agricultural population as those that did not, suggesting that the rural exodus was determined by factors other than the tariff.;1997;Did tariffs stifle Spanish agriculture before 1936?;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Sokoloff, Kenneth L.; Dollar, David";The greater flexibility associated with workers being able to choose the time and circumstance of their work allowed cottage manufacture to compete with technically more productive manufactories by rendering it more effective at harnessing a part time or offpeak workforce whose opportunity cost was low. Not only did this mean that cottage manufacture was better suited to the employment of women and children, who preferred flexibility in their hours and place of work, but also that the greater seasonality of labor supply in England led that economy to rely more on cottage manufacturing than did the United States during early industrialization.;1997;Agricultural Seasonalily and the Organization of Manufacturing in Early Industrial Economies: The Contrast Between England and the United States;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Sokoloff, Kenneth L.; Tchakerian, Viken";We employ the 1860 Census of Manufactures to study rural antebellum manufacturing in the South and Midwest, and find that manufacturing output per capita was similar across regions in counties specialized in the same agricultural products. The southern deficit in manufactures per capita appears to have been largely attributable to the very low levels of output in counties specialized in cotton production. This implies that it was the South's geographical suitability for highly profitable cotton production, not the existence of slavery per se, that was responsible for the region's limited industrial development—at least in rural areas. The other major finding is that in both the South and the Midwest measured total factor productivity was significantly lower in counties specialized in wheat (the most seasonal of agricultural products with respect to labor requirements). This result is consistent with suggestions that agricultural districts where the predominant crops were highly seasonal tended to support manufacturing enterprise during the off-peak periods.;1997;Manufacturing Where Agriculture Predominates: Evidence from the South and Midwest in 1860;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Spoerer, Mark;For fifteen years economic historians have discussed whether the German economy suffered from a ‘crisis before the crisis’ during 1925–29, and if so, why. Apart from wages, the most widely debated issue is Weimar's investment record. The contributions so far have relied on the database of Walther Hoffmann which allows a comparison of Weimar's net investment and net product with the pre-World War I period. In this paper, alternative time series for gross fixed investment and gross national product are compiled for the period 1901–32. These data confirm Weimar's poor overall economic growth. However, it appears that Weimar's aggregate investment ratio was quite ‘normal’, if compared both intertemporally with the late Empire and internationally with other major economies in the 1920s. It is argued that further discussion of Weimar's investment record should focus on the productivity of private and especially of public investment rather than on its aggregate level.;1997;Weimar's investment and growth record in intertemporal and international perspective;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Stone, David;Despite a dearth of evidence, the relative efficiency of free and unfree labour is a theme of considerable historical importance, not least for seigneurial agriculture in medieval England. This article presents new data, from the manorial account rolls of a medieval demesne farm, which suggest that the forced labour of customary tenants was significantly less productive than hired labour. It is suggested that this finding, if generally applicable, would have broad implications for our understanding of agricultural productivity, both within medieval England and in comparing medieval yields with those of later centuries.;1997;The Productivity of Hired and Customary Labour: Evidence from Wisbech Barton in the Fourteenth Century;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Taylor, Alan M.;"The Argentine economy was transformed in the late nineteenth century by the mass migration of millions of Europeans. Various ideas have surfaced concerning the likely impact of this labor inflow: that it favored the wheat revolution on the pampa; that it promoted urbanization and the rapid growth of Buenos Aires; that it paved the way for Argentine industrialization; that it caused slack in the labor markets, lowering wages. This paper attempts an analysis of the impact of migration on the scale and structure of the Argentine economy and tries to resolve various competing hypotheses. The paper presents a new social accounting matrix (SAM) for Argentina and uses it to calibrate a CGE model. My results suggest that immigration enhanced Argentina's comparative advantage as a cereal producer and exporter, encouraged extensive growth on the pampa, and markedly lowered real wages.";1997;Peopling the Pampa: On the Impact of Mass Migration to the River Plate, 1870–1914;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Taylor, Alan M.; Williamson, Jeffrey G.";"Between 1870 and 1913 economic convergence among present OECD members (or an even wider sample of countries) was dramatic, about as dramatic as it has been over the past century and a half. What were the sources of the convergence? One prime candidate is mass migration. This paper offers some estimates which suggest that migration could account for very large shares of the convergence in labour productivity and real wages, though a much smaller share in GDP per capita. One might conclude, therefore, that virtual cessation of convergence in the interwar period could be partially explained by the imposition of quotas and other barriers to migration.

The exportation of labourers and capital from old to new countries, from a place where their productive power is less to a place where it is greater, increases by so much the aggregate produce of wealth of the old and the new country.… Colonization, in the present state of the world, is the best affair of business, in which the capital of an old and wealthy country can engage.

-John Stuart Mill1

It must be emphasized that without the change in the proportions of the factors of production that occurs as a result of migration or population growth, differences in factor prices in various countries will persist, and the factors of production of the world as a whole will not be used to their best advantage.

A simulation model is used to determine the importance of three distinctive Soviet institutions/policies - the concentration of investment on heavy industry, the collectivisation of agriculture, and the use of ambitious output targets in conjunction with soft budget constraints to guide business activity. It is shown that the investment strategy and the planning system were responsible for rapid industrialisation, including a significant rise in the standard of living.

Clark, Gregory;Common property rights were widespread in English agriculture for at least 600 years. Since privatizing common fields allegedly produced huge profits in the eighteenth century, common land owners seemingly squandered 15 percent of potential income for generations. Ingenious explanations have been produced for this market failure. This article argues for a simple, brutal resolution. Common fields survived because enclosure was generally unprofitable before 1750, when changing relative prices made private property rights marginally more efficient. Then people responded quickly to modest profits. The rich gains from enclosure existed only in the imaginings of wild-eyed eighteenth century agrarian reformers.;1998;Commons Sense: Common Property Rights, Efficiency, and Institutional Change;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

They prospered for more than half a millennium because they sustained interregional specialized labor markets and contributed to technological invention by stimulating technical diffusion through migrant labor and by providing inventors with temporary monopoly rents. They played a leading role in preindustrial manufacture because their main competitor, rural putting out, was a net consumer rather than producer of technological innovation.

"Federico, Giovanni; Tena, Antonio";This paper aims at measuring as precisely as possible the changes in the level of protection in Italy from the 1870s to the 1920s - i.e. during the first phase of the country's industrialisation. It shows that, contrary to conventional wisdom, protection was quite low - with the possible exception of a short spell of time in the late 1880s–90s. Therefore the static welfare losses were small, but also the alleged dynamic role of protection in fostering industrialisation seems small as well. In the last section of the paper we speculate on the implications of these findings for other countries. This evidence is not conclusive, but it does cast some doubts on the relevance of protection in 19th century Europe.;1998;Was Italy a protectionist country?;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Feinstein, Charles H.;New estimates of nominal earnings and the cost of living are presented and used to make a fresh assessment of changes in the real earnings of male and female manual workers in Britain from 1770 to 1870. Workers' average real earnings are then adjusted for factors such as unemployment, the number of their dependants, and the costs of urbanization. The main finding is that the standard of living of the average working-class family improved by less than 15 percent between the 1780s and 1850s. This long plateau is shown to be consistent with other economic, political, and demographic indicators.;1998;Pessimism Perpetuated: Real Wages and the Standard of Living in Britain during and after the Industrial Revolution;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Field-Hendrey, Elizabeth B.;Differential treatment of men and women in nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century labor markets casts doubt on the common practice of adding male and female labor to create a single ???labor??? variable in the production function. This article shows that men and women must be disaggregated in the production function, and investigates the effects of inappropriate aggregation on the debate over the Habakkuk-Rothbarth labor scarcity hypothesis. With disaggregation, a female-using bias and an overall labor-using bias is found for the period 1850 through 1919. Technical change was male-neutral through 1900 and male-using thereafter.;1998;The Role of Gender in Biased Technical Change: U.S. Manufacturing, 1850???1919;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Fishback, Price V.; Kantor, Shawn Everett";Most members of the key economic interest groups with a stake in workers' compensation anticipated gains. Despite their general agreement on the superiority of a no-fault system of accident compensation, the various interest groups fought over the level of accident benefits the new law would provide. These legislated benefit levels were important because they determined each group's share of the rents that workers' compensation created. The disputes were ultimately settled by state legislators who responded to pressures from both employer and worker groups. An empirical analysis of the workers' compensation benefit parameters that emerged from the political process shows that employers in high-accident risk industries succeeded in securing relatively lower benefits, while those in high-wage industries succeeded in keeping benefit levels in check. Employers' successes in lobbying for their optimal benefits were tempered in states where organized labor was strong, where political reform movements led to political shifts in the state legislature, and where bureaucratic agencies administered the workers' compensation system.;1998;The Political Economy of Workers' Compensation Benefit Levels, 1910–1930;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Fohlin, Caroline;This study presents new evidence on the influence of German-style relationship banking on investment patterns of Italian firms. Bank-affiliated firms were larger than independent firms but invested at lower rates. All firms, particularly newly public firms, demonstrate liquidity sensitivity of investment. Bank attachments apparently yielded no consistent amelioration of these effects. Further, the findings on performance offer little support for the idea that universal banks provide important screening services to investors. The results parallel the German experience and thus, formalized banking relationships appear to have made limited impact on firms' investments in the pre-World War I period.;1998;Fiduciariand Firm Liquidity Constraints: The Italian Experience with German-Style Universal Banking;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Foreman-Peck, James; Boccaletti, E.; Nicholas, Tom";A popular explanation for the supposed ‘delayed industrialisation’ of the nineteenth century French economy has been the inappropriate attitudes and actions of the managerial classes and family firms. To address these claims we model the supply and demand for entrepreneurship and also management success. We analyse a data set of 244 nineteenth century French businessmen, showing that on the demand side textiles offered greater, and iron and steel less, than average opportunities. On the supply side, secondary and university education were negatively associated with starting a successful firm, as was a father already in business. Surprisingly, Protestantism made no difference to the chances of setting up a firm. In the business performance model, the longer the period the businessman was active, the greater the accumulation - not consistent with life-cycle models of saving. Second, those who started their own business, compared with entering an existing firm, left less wealth at death than they could have expected to acquire over a normal lifetime, other things being equal. Unlike formal education, training - mainly apprenticeship - was associated with greater wealth at death. The pace of wealth accumulation suggests a dynamic sector during the Second Empire, at least where larger businesses were concerned.;1998;Entrepreneurs and business performance in nineteenth century France;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Goodwin, Barry K.; Grennes, Thomas J.";Russian grain trade, production, and consumption during the Tsarist period (1861–1914) is empirically evaluated. Russia was the world's largest wheat exporter during this period. Tsarist Russian agriculture is often characterized in the literature as having been “backward” and not well-integrated with international markets. In contrast to this view, this analysis finds that the Russian grain trade was significantly influenced by international prices and was well-integrated with the international commercial wheat trade. Our results indicate that after 1880 regional wheat markets in Russia were linked and that a strong connection had been established between Russian ports and cities at the center of the world wheat trade. Deviations from equilibrium price relationships were found to be eliminated more rapidly for trade between Odessa and England than for wheat trade between New York and England. In addition, grain trade is shown to have been positively influenced by the development of the rail system.;1998;Tsarist Russia and the World Wheat Market;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

We report evidence in favor of segmented convergence processes for GDP per capita and real wages. In contrast, the industrial output per worker gap between the two economies appears nonstationary, and divergent during the century after 1870. The evolution of distinct industrial systems precludes an important role for industrial technology transfer in GDP per capita convergence.

Herscovici, Steven;Research on nineteenth-century economic and social mobility has concentrated on occupational change among men who remained in the same community for ten or more years, although fewer than half of any community's residents persist that long. This article uses a data set created specifically to compare the experiences of men who migrated from Newburyport, Massachusetts in the mid-nineteenth century with those of men who persisted. It finds that blue-collar migrants were more successful than were their counterparts who did not move.

"Hollis, Aidan; Sweetman, Arthur";Hundreds of independent, local, quasi-charitable microcredit societies, or “loan funds,” were lending to as many as 20% of Irish households in the mid-19th century. Their goal was to relieve poverty by providing credit to the “industrious poor” at competitive interest rates without public funding. They successfully mitigated informational, moral hazard, and enforcement problems, and operated at a surplus in a market where intermediation by the banks seems not to have been profitable. Loan fund activity offers new insights into capital formation in the 19th-century Irish economy and challenges traditional notions regarding the economic activities of the Irish poor.

The Republicans proposed higher tariffs to reduce imports and customs revenues. This article attempts to determine the revenue effects of the proposed changes. Given the height of the tariff and the price elasticity of U.S. import demand, the actual tariff was below the maximum revenue rate, and therefore a tariff reduction would have reduced customs revenue.;1998;Higher Tariffs, Lower Revenues?

Kelly, Trish;The paper explores sovereign debt repayment during the late 19th and early 20th centuries within the context of an ability and willingness to pay approach. The paper's ability to pay hypothesis is that state interventions which promoted national economic development fostered repayment by directing borrowing to productive use. The paper's willingness to pay hypothesis is that repayment was enhanced by debtors' trade ties with Britain, the principal creditor during the period. Bolstered by Britain's status as the world's preeminent power, the British bondholders' organization, the Corporation of Foreign Bondholders, employed a variety of enforcement strategies to increase the costs of default. Using a new data set, derived principally from Corporation of Foreign Bondholders' records, the paper presents an econometric test of the two central hypotheses.;1998;Ability and Willingness to Pay in the Age of Pax Britannica, 1890–1914;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Economic integration, as we as long-run secular changes in the economic structure associated with economic growth, played an important role in determining U.S. regional industrial structures. Moreover, although differences in regional industrial structures do not explain all the variations in regional income per capita, they played an important role in causing U.S. regional incomes to diverge and converge between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.;1998;Economic Integration and Convergence: U.S. Regions, 1840???1987;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Family reconstitution data from 60 villages provide evidence of considerable excess female mortality among married adults. The empirical findings are consistent with a bargaining approach to understanding intrahousehold resource allocation and suggest that women's survival disadvantage is related to their positions in the remarriage market, the perceived value of their work, as well as differences in altruism. Agricultural change appears to be one factor responsible for the emergence of this disadvantage.;1998;Marriage, Bargaining, and Intrahousehold Resource Allocation: Excess Female Mortality among Adults during Early German Development, 1740???1860;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Klovland, Jan Tore;"Evidence from newly constructed monthly indices of manufacturing production shows that differences between the Scandinavian countries regarding business cycles in the interwar years were closely related to monetary policy decisions. In the 1920s Sweden made an early return to gold, while Denmark and Norway experienced large fluctuations in nominal and real exchange rates before restoring the gold standard at the prewar parity in 1927–28. The differences in monetary policy were mirrored in the business cycle history; Denmark and Norway being alone in having a particularly severe contraction period in the years 1925–27, referred to as the gold-parity depression. The nominal depreciation of the effective exchange rates following the abandonment of the gold standard in September 1931 led to a significant real depreciation in all three countries. Econometric evidence confirms the view that the decision to leave gold was instrumental in dampening the contractionary business cycle impulses from abroad during the years of the Great Depression.";1998;Monetary policy and business cycles in the interwar years: The Scandinavian experience;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Lindert, Peter H.;An eclectic array of quantitative data sketches public and private poor relief in the century before 1880, and invites new interpretations. Church and secular charity was meagre in the eighteenth century, and probably earlier. While richer countries transferred a higher share of national income to the poor than did poorer countries, the trend in this share failed to march upward with income across the nineteenth century. Some explanations are proposed for the differences between countries and the decline in poor relief's share of national income in England-Wales and the Low Countries before 1880. It may be that the newly franchised had stronger reasons to oppose tax-based relief than the elites who had voice at the start of the century. Changes in voice partly explain the movements of English poor relief over time and space. So do movements in the chances that the disenfranchised would exit from cooperating and supplying labour.;1998;Poor relief before the Welfare State: Britain versus the Continent, 1780-1880;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Maloney, Thomas N.;Personnel records of the A. M. Byers Company indicate that, during the 1910s and 1920s, black workers left this firm for health reasons much more frequently than white workers did. The purpose of this paper is to determine whether this racial gap in health-related turnover reflected the concentration of black workers in particularly hazardous jobs. Estimated hazard rates for health-related turnover indicate that almost none of the racial gap was due to differences in observable individual characteristics, but about half can be accounted for by the segregation of black workers into departments with particularly high rates of health-related turnover.;1998;Racial Segregation, Working Conditions, and Workers' Health: Evidence from the A.

The data pertain to Elche, a town in the Valencia region of southeastern Spain that witnessed early and rapid industrial development in the context of Spain's delayed industrialisation and experienced strong immigration during the twentieth century. Thus, the relationship between biological standards of living and industrialisation and urbanisation is explored. The data suggest that the first stages of industrialisation in the late nineteenth century did not bring much improvement to workers' living conditions. The consequences to health and nutrition of Spain's Civil War and its aftermath are also examined. Finally, we comment on the process of general convergence in height that took place at the end of the period considered.;1998;Height and standards of living during the industrialisation of Spain: The case of Elche;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Millward, Robert; Bell, F. N.";Although mortality in Britain showed a long term decline from as early as the eighteenth century, it stagnated in the nineteenth century under the pressures of urbanisation and industrialisation. This paper examines the economic factors which lay behind the resumption of the mortality decline in Britain 1870–1914. A framework of analysis is developed which distinguishes factors in the physical environment (like population density) which affected mortality directly, from price and income movements which affected decisions about expenditure on sewers, water supplies, food, medical staff. A regression analysis of mortality in a sample of 36 towns in England and Wales suggests increases in the incomes of households and town council tax revenues were instrumental in the decline of mortality. This allowed extra spending not only on food, as McKeown emphasised, but also on a wide range of health-enhancing goods and services. The major improvement in the physical environment was the housing stock which rose faster than the population whilst its quality and dimensions were increasingly regulated by central and local government.;1998;Economic factors in the decline of mortality in late nineteenth century Britain;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Neldner, M.;Free banking in Switzerland lasted from 1826 to 1907. Although the system was reasonably successful, the Swiss experience has been almost entirely neglected in the debate over free banking. In its more advanced state of development, the stability of the Swiss free banking system deteriorated, since (1) all assumptions underlying the so-called law of adverse clearings were more or less violated, and (2) the note-issuing banks were prevented by their non-issuing rivals from increasing their discount rates, even if some of them were faced with heavy losses of specie. In 1907, therefore, free banking had to be abandoned.;1998;Lessons from the free banking era in Switzerland: The law of adverse clearings and the role of the non-issuing credit banks;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Only after 1880 did metropolitan networks form around new wholesale distribution centers, notably Atlanta and Dallas. Unlike coastal ports, these cities mediated more diverse commercial and financial transactions and attracted more correspondent banks.

Olney, Martha L.;Black families included in the 1918/19 BLS Consumer Purchases Survey used installment credit more frequently and merchant credit less frequently than White families. Economic and demographic characteristics explain the racial difference for installment but not for merchant credit. I argue greater demand for installment credit by Black families was satisfied because repossession of collateral upon buyer default overcame merchants' personal prejudice with regard to creditworthiness, but absence of tangible collateral impacted the availability of merchant credit. Low use of merchant credit can account for relatively high interwar saving rates for low-income Black families.;1998;When Your Word Is Not Enough: Race, Collateral, and Household Credit;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Pammer, Michael;This article examines private Austrian investment in the Hungarian economy as an example of private financial investment in a backward foreign economy in the late nineteenth century. The main finding is the dominant role of Austrian investment in institutional securities such as Hungarian state bonds and bank securities, which comprised a steadily rising proportion in the portfolios of investors. The only other important sector of the Hungarian economy that was invested in directly was the transport system, which depended on the fluctuations in the development of the Hungarian economy rather than on long-term trends. Securities of the manufacturing sector did not attract the interest of most Austrian investors. Banks and the state thus constituted an element of stability in the Hungarian economy and helped it to acquire funds that could not be provided by the domestic market.;1998;Austrian private investments in Hungary, 1850-1913;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Though the exchanges existed for nearly a century, critics argued that exchange rate fluctuations exacerbated financial panics. We find, using cointegration analysis over the period from 1899 to 1908, that differences in growth rates across regions caused predictable movements in rates. We conclude that the exchanges promoted efficiency in the payments system. This supports the view that the private sector might have developed a unified national system had the Fed not abolished the exchanges.;1998;Domestic Exchange Rates and Regional Economic Growth in the United States, 1899???1908: Evidence from Cointegration Analysis;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

During the second half of the eighteenth century, they expanded greatly their production in response to a dynamic market. This success was achieved not through the adoption of new methods or the expansion of enterprises but through subcontracting practices. This article explores the conditions that fostered such strategies.

Ritschl, Albrecht O.;This paper examines the effects of Germany's inter-war reparation agreements in the framework of the Keynesian transfer problem. According to conventional wisdom, with free capital mobility reparation transfers are necessarily under-effected. I argue that while this is true for the Dawes Plan period between 1924 and 1929, the Young Plan for German reparations after 1929 created an external credit constraint such that during the depression, no counteracting capital flows could come forth and reparations were fully (or over-) effected. This is consistent with the so-called Borchardt hypothesis, which claims that stabilisation policy in Germany during the Great Depression was credit constrained and that lack of budgetary discipline during the preceding years was instrumental in creating this constraint. Accounting for the foreign credit restriction created by the Young Plan, Germany's deflationary policies during the slump can be interpreted as the austerity reaction to an imminent foreign debt crisis. The balance of payment stabilisation required by the Young Plan explains most of the decline in German national product during the depression if Keynesian import functions are assumed and suitably parameterised. Simulation of various different transfer profiles suggests that with tighter macroeconomic policies during the Dawes Plan period after 1924, a large part of the income contraction after 1929 could have been avoided. The results imply that both parts of Borchardt's hypothesis hold up even under plainly Keynesian assumptions.;1998;Reparation transfers, the Borchardt hypothesis and the Great Depression in Germany, 1929-32: A guided tour for hard-headed Keynesians;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The use of strikebrekers was not correlated with business cycle and did not vary appreciably by region or city size, but employers located outside the Northeast or in smaller cities were more likely to use replacement workers recruited from other places.

Rosés, Joan Ramón;The article argues that for a region adopting a technology from elsewhere, an existing stock of (relevant) human capital was essential to the rapid and successful adoption of the technology. But once the technology has been fully assimilated, increments to human capital would not be expected to be important in its further growth. Thus, Catalan industrialisation was possible because the level of human capital present in industry was enough to adopt and modify new technologies. Human capital stock was mainly the result of past investments in on-the-job training, and children's informal education took place in the workplace rather than the schoolroom. Therefore, the level of human capital present in the workforce was higher than literacy and schooling rates showed. However, evidence is also presented on the low contribution made by human capital to growth rates.;1998;Measuring the contribution of human capital to the development of the Catalan factory system (1830-61);European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Schenk, Catherine R.;The Eurocurrency market is arguably the most dramatic financial innovation in the post-war period yet very little is known about its origins. This paper examines two facets of the Eurodollar market: why it happened and why London kept most of the business. Using archival evidence, this article reveals that Eurodollars were accumulated earlier than has hitherto been thought. This has important implications for how we interpret the factors prompting the innovation. High interest rates, self-regulation by banks, and changes in access to the forward exchange market combined in mid-1955 to encourage innovation by the Midland Bank. The major source of competitive advantage for London was the regulatory environment which combined tight money in the domestic economy with relative freedom in international finance.;1998;The Origins of the Eurodollar Market in London: 1955–1963;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The Whiskey Trust distilled alcoholic spirits and bribed distributors not to carry competing brands of spirits. For the Whiskey Trust, exclusive dealing was an ineffective predatory strategy. Despite the trust's market dominance and manifold predatory strategies, it failed to preempt entry. The trust failed, in part, because its rivals could vertically integrate at low cost. Competition disciplined the trust more effectively than did numerous antitrust suits.;1998;Exclusive Dealing and the Whiskey Trust, 1890???1895;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Voth, Hans-Joachim;Witnesses' accounts are used to analyze changes in working hours between 1750 and 1800. Two findings stand out. The article demonstrates that the information contained in witnesses' accounts allows us to reconstruct historical time-budgets and provides extensive tests of the new method. Estimates of annual labor input in 1749/63 and 1799/1803 are presented. It emerges that the number of annual working hours changed rapidly between the middle and the of the eighteenth century. These findings have important implications for the issue of total factor productivity during the Industrial Revolution.;1998;Time and Work in Eighteenth-Century London;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
WALLIS, JOHN JOSEPH;During the New Deal the federal government initiated a policy of massive grants to states for support of social welfare and other programs. Since that time scholars have debated whether the allocation of these grants between the states during the New Deal was motivated primarily by political or social and economic objectives. This paper shows that, during the 1930s, both political and economic effects were important determinants of grant allocation. The importance of all the political variables is dramatically affected by the inclusion or exclusion of Nevada. The “Nevada” effect seems to be the result of the state's very small population. An alternative specification of the grant process produces new results that overturn some of the results in the existing literature.;1998;The Political Economy of New Deal Spending Revisited, Again: With and without Nevada;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Wegge, Simone A.;Chain migration was an important factor in European migrants' decisions in the nineteenth century. This article demonstrates that previous migrations have long-run effects and continue to impact the decisions of future migrants for many years. Chain migration produces not only more migration but different migrants. Migrants from over 1,300 different German villages are classified as networked and non-networked. The most definitive results from comparing the two types of migrants are the figures on cash assets because they support the model's prediction that socially networked migrants needed less cash than non-networked migrants to accomplish their migration goals.;1998;Chain Migration and Information Networks: Evidence From Nineteenth-Century Hesse-Cassel;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Williamson, Jeffrey G.;If we have learned anything from the recent outpouring of empirical growth equations, it is that life is far too complex to expect “unconditional” convergence among all countries and at all times. For example, when treated properly, both demography and globalization can be shown to have a significant impact on GDP per capita growth. Similarly, no economist should expect an “unconditional” Kuznets curve to emerge from the inequality experience of all countries and at all times. The industrial revolutionary forces that are thought to have an impact on inequality can be offset or reinforced by demography and globalization. This essay assesses the role of globalization and demography on inequality and growth experience in the Old World, the New World, and Asia over the past century and a half.;1998;Growth, Distribution, and Demography: Some Lessons from History;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Winegarden, C. R.; Murray, John E.";The causes of the historical decline in European mortality rates are still vigorously debated. Our contribution is to examine a previously neglected aspect, the role of the early government-sponsored health-insurance programs in widening access to medical care. We construct and test fixed-effect models of mortality rates, using data for a panel of five European countries over the 1878–1913 period. After diagnostic tests of our results, we conclude that the expanding population coverage of these health-insurance programs contributed significantly to the observed declines in mortality.;1998;The Contributions of Early Health-Insurance Programs to Mortality Declines in Pre-World War I Europe: Evidence from Fixed-Effects Models;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

I demonstrate that the geographic relationship inside France between agricultural product mix and voting behavior helps to explain French governmental conduct during three major episodes of international agricultural policymaking.

Arnold, A. J.;This article provides new information on profitability, taxation, and capital accumulation across the transwar period, based on an analysis of the accounting records of 30 companies in a range of industrial sectors. The main findings, that apparently high profitability in the war period was largely an illusion, and that the subsequent slump was very severe in its effects on business profitability, are consistent with views of the period as one of low capital accumulation. In effect, the generosity of the state's negotiating position towards capital owners during the war was cancelled out by the combined effects of inflation and of the severe postwar slump.;1999;Profitability and capital accumulation in British industry during the transwar period, 1913–1924;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Atack, Jeremy; Rousseau, Peter L.";Using annual data, this paper develops new indexes of price performance, dividend yields, and total returns for bank stocks and industrial equities traded on the Boston stock market between 1835 and 1869, a time when it was the nation's premier market for industrials. Using these new series and a set of vector autoregressive models, we conclude that disturbances in the banking sector, as manifested by declines in total returns to bank stockholders, led to increases in short-term lending rates which in turn led to declines in the price performance of traded industrial firms. There is no evidence of feedback from industrial stock returns to bank stock prices via lending rates. The findings are consistent with a key role for banks in 19th-century business fluctuations.;1999;Business Activity and the Boston Stock Market, 1835–1869;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Baker, Mae; Collins, Michael";Internal bank archives are used to examine the nature of English bank/firm relationships during periods of business distress in the decades before 1914. The performance of the banks is examined in the context of theoretical assertions regarding relationship and transaction banking and bank response to the problems of adverse selection and moral hazard. New estimates of bank losses on industrial accounts are made. The results indicate that the banks supported their industrial clients during periods of distress by continuing with existing loans but rarely became deeply involved with clients' business. Effective screening of loan applications, the use of short-term loans and of sample collateral stipulations safeguarded against moral hazard and minimised losses for the banks, even with such high risk accounts.;1999;English industrial distress before 1914 and the response of the banks;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Bodenhorn, Howard;This paper provides some insights into the microeconomics of antebellum banking practice. The surviving records of the Black River Bank of Watertown, New York include two discount books for the period 1844 to 1859. These loan records report the borrowers' names, loan maturities, loan amounts, interest rates, and several other characteristics. Combining this information with data from city directories and manuscript censuses, a picture of one banker's lending practice emerges. While the practices of one banker cannot be taken as representative of an entire industry, the findings suggest that early American bankers may have served the dual (and not incompatible) roles of a real-bills mercantile bank and an innovation-inducing Schumpeterian bank.;1999;An Engine of Growth: Real Bills and Schumpeterian Banking in Antebellum New York;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Collins, William J.;I use district-level wage and food price data for the period 1873 to 1906 to investigate the impact of improvements in transportation on the price of labor in late 19th century India. Falling transport costs could have promoted regional wage convergence by facilitating both labor mobility and interregional commodity trade. There is, however, only qualified evidence of wage convergence in late 19th century India, and it appears that the steady-state dispersion of wages was not compressed by the forces of “globalization.” Relatively low rates of internal migration, weak Heckscher–Ohlin factor price convergence forces, and high climatic variability all contribute to this result.;1999;Labor Mobility, Market Integration, and Wage Convergence in Late 19th Century India;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Costa-Gomes, M.; Tavares, J.";"The Portuguese Republic of 1910–1926 was characterised by extreme instability in the political and economic spheres. The authoritarian regime that succeeded the Republic claimed legitimacy asserting that democracy naturally implied fiscal and monetary instability. In this article we study the Republican period and the Monarchy that immediately preceded it, in order to test three hypotheses as to the roots of instability during the Republic: exceptionally high public expenditure made necessary by participation in World War I, the Fiscal Hypothesis; expansion of the money supply and increase in its variability, the Monetary Hypothesis; social and political unrest, facilitated by greater freedom in expressing grievances, the Democracy Hypothesis. Using standard econometric techniques we find strong evidence in favour of the Monetary and the Democracy Hypotheses but not in favour of the Fiscal Hypothesis. Moreover, our results support the view that political and monetary instability were mutually reinforcing phenomena. The examination of the two periods, Monarchy and Republic, reveals a strong positive association between political and economic cycles in the later, more democratic period.";1999;Democracy and business cycles: Evidence from Portuguese economic history;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Easterlin, R. A.;A short answer is, not very. In contrast to economic growth, where the free market is commonly viewed as a prime mover, mortality in the last two centuries has not been greatly helped by market forces. The classic sources of market failure - information failures, externalities, public goods, principal-agent, and free rider problems - have been pervasive. Nor has economic growth itself been behind the worldwide improvement in life expectancy. In the primitive state of nineteenth century health knowledge, the immense rise in urbanisation engendered by economic growth largely vitiated any positive level-of-living effects by increasing exposure to disease. Instead, public policy initiatives, based on new knowledge of disease and new institutions, have been essential to the improvement of life expectancy, both in urban areas and nationwide.;1999;How beneficent is the market?

"Engelbrecht-Wiggans, Richard; Nonnenmacher, Tomas";The completion of the Erie Canal traditionally receives primary credit for the rapid growth of trade through the Port of New York relative to trade through other East Coast ports. This credit ignores the dramatic increase in imports through New York prior to the completion of the canal. We examine an alternative explanation for this earlier growth. Specifically, in 1817, the New York legislature changed the law regarding auction of imports. In developing a theory to demonstrate the benefits of the new auction design, we give credence to claims that the change in the auction law contributed to New York's rapid growth.;1999;A Theoretical Basis for 19th-Century Changes to the Port of New York Imported Goods Auction;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Fohlin, Caroline;German-style universal banks are widely believed to improve capital mobilisation and utilisation by stimulating savings, matching savers and investors, and offering business and investment advice to entrepreneurs. Using aggregate and firm-level evidence on deposit taking and branching, banks' liability structure, interlocking directorates between banks and industrial companies, and industrial investment patterns, this article investigates the role of universal banks in two European latecomer economies: Germany and Italy. Comparing the impact of these banks permits some distinction between institutional effects and country-specific effects. The findings suggest that universal banking took on differing forms in Germany and Italy, implying that apparently similar institutions can yield divergent economic outcomes depending on the context in which they develop. For both countries, the results also indicate that the universal banks made a modest impact on capital mobilisation, industrial investment, and economic growth.;1999;Capital mobilisation and utilisation in latecomer economies: Germany and Italy compared;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Fohlin, Caroline;This paper underscores the influence of political and legal environments and historical accident in shaping financial systems and in determining their ability to promote growth. The study suggests that many widely cited characteristics of the German banking system emerged only to a limited extent during industrialization. Many features that did appear were unrelated to the banks' universal structure, and provided no exceptional impetus to growth. I hypothesize that institutional banking design generally has little impact on capital mobilization or risk diversification. I conclude by questioning the usefulness of the Gerschenkronian framework for understanding problems of financial system design and by proposing an alternative agenda structured around theoretical principles.;1999;Universal Banking in Pre-World War I Germany: Model or Myth?;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

It uses an options-based model to establish that deposit rates should have varied systematically with bank asset return volatility, capitalization, and liability structures. The model's predictions are borne out in regressions using data from 1889, 1894, and 1899.

Grantham, George W.;"The Ricardian model that inspires the conventional account of pre-industrial economic history assumes that productive opportunities are fully exploited, and that economic growth and fluctuations reflect the interaction of technological improvement, diminishing returns to labour and capital, and homeostatic demographic responses to changes in per capita income. This article argues that the long swings in output and productivity were the consequence of endogenous variation in trading costs affecting the profitability of undertaking specialised investment in market production. Because its markets were often ‘thin’, the pre-industrial economy possessed latent reserves of productivity that were not fully exploited. A search-equilibrium model is developed to demonstrate how such an economy could experience swings in output and productivity in the absence of technological or other ‘fundamental’ changes. The argument is supported by evidence indicating that the level of output in the second century may have approached that of the early eighteenth century.

Using annual data for 1870 to 1939, a vector autoregression is estimated and used to analyze the contributions of innovations to the GNP growth over the wheat boom period. The most striking result is the substantial impact of innovations in population. Exports also played an important role and the investment boom that occurred is seen as arising endogenously from the dynamics of the model. Comparing the results with those of Chambers and Gordon (1966,Journal of Political Economy74,315–332), the estimated impact on per capita income is much larger and highlights the importance of economies of scale, which are neglected in their analysis.;1999;Population Growth and the Dynamics of Canadian Development: A Multivariate Time Series Approach;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Groote, P.; Jacobs, J.; Sturm, J.-E.";"Economic historians have always assigned a large role to infrastructure in the process of economic growth. For instance, it is commonly agreed that infrastructure endowments made the Netherlands the economic superpower in the pre-industrial era, but depressed economic growth in the first half of the nineteenth century, and then again enabled modern economic growth in the second half of the nineteenth century. However, this hypothesis has never been tested quantitatively, mainly because of the lack of reliable data. A new database on infrastructural investments allows us to confirm the hypothesis for the second half of the nineteenth century. Our main conclusion is that the investments in new infrastructure (mainly railways and waterways), clearly paid off. However, these positive effects lasted only temporarily; the Dutch economy did not switch to a permanently higher growth path. Also, it was some time before entrepreneurs fully reaped the potential benefits of a better infrastructure.";1999;Infrastructure and economic development in the Netherlands, 1853-1913;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Grossman, Richard S.;"This article examines the bank amalgamation movement in England between 1870 and 1914. I assemble data on all publicly traded English bank equities and use a simple finance model to estimate the effects of concentration. Holding returns on English bank stocks declined steadily over the period, which I attribute to a negative demand shock resulting from banks' declining importance relative to other financial intermediaries. Once this decline is accounted for, increased concentration appears to have bolstered bank returns. This suggests that increased concentration may have rendered English banks less efficient as allocators of capital and may have contributed to Britain's industrial decline.

[The amalgamation] movement appears to have by no means reached its limits, and it is neither safe nor easy to predict with any confidence the eventual outcome of a movement of which the development is incomplete. Whether or not … in the course of a few more years all banking business in this country will be monopolised by some half dozen powerful institutions, there seems little reason to doubt that many of the old inducements to amalgamation still operate, and that the closing years of the century will witness a further reduction in the number of existing banks. In any event, conjecture as to the ultimate outcome of the tendency must be mainly based on past experience, and in light of that experience the question of whether the movement is likely on the whole to be a beneficial one must be discussed";1999;Rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic: English banking concentration and efficiency, 1870-1914;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

HENRIKSEN, INGRID;The paper investigates the initial phase of the cooperative organisation of agricultural processing firms in Denmark. It argues that the variations observed can be explained within the framework of the theory of industrial organisation. The focus is on the success of cooperative creameries. In 1903, twenty years after the first establishments, the owners of about 80 per cent of all Danish milch cows supplied their product to a cooperative. The success of cooperatives within other fields of production was smaller by comparison. The point is that dairying cooperatives, given the existing technology of gathering information and of preserving and transporting a perishable product, were ideally suited to overcome the problems of potential lock-in and of asymmetric information.;1999;Avoiding lock-in: Cooperative creameries in Denmark, 1882-1903;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

We find that internationals did not weaken Canada's union movement; nor did the two union types act in concert.

Lee, Chulhee;This study explores the effect of farm value on retirement decisions of farm owners in the early twentieth century. The average farm value per acre of county, as of either 1900 or 1910, and the growth rate over the decade had a strong positive effect on the probability of retirement of farm owners in 1910. Farm owners were more responsive to a change in farm value if it was not produced by a shift in the farmland productivity, which raised the opportunity cost of retirement. I argue that the rapid growth in the value of farm properties between 1900 and 1910 was a major force behind the decline in the labor force participation rate of males ages 65 and over during the same period.;1999;Farm Value and Retirement of Farm Owners in Early-Twentieth-Century America;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

By mapping movements in both foreign and Australian revealed technological advantage in Victoria in this period, this article demonstrates that this faster rate of foreign patenting was due not to the technological weaknesses of the Australian colonies, but rather to the nature and timing of their economic development.;1999;Technological Development and Foreign Patenting: Evidence from 19th-Century Australia;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

I use a “difference-in-differences-in-differences” procedure to isolate the effects of the laws from the effects of other forces influencing the demand and supply of child labor. I find that minimum age limits had relatively little effect on the occupation choices of children at the turn of the century and conclude that these restrictions contributed little to the long run decline in child labor.;1999;State Child Labor Laws and the Decline of Child Labor;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Nicholas, Tom;This article analyses the proportions of personal to real estate wealth for a group of 295 businessmen profiled in the Dictionary of business biography.

Low levels of social mobility are identified as a function of land purchase, and new insights are given into the relationship between wealth, status, and land ownership. Any integration of business and landed wealth in this period was not a consequence of businessmen becoming landowners.;1999;Businessmen and land ownership in the late nineteenth century;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Nilsson, A.; Pettersson, L.; Svensson, Patrick";Did the relatively high level of literacy in Sweden prior to 1850 play any role in agrarian change and economic growth? According to influential scholars, such as Carlo Cipolla and Lars Sandberg, this was not the case. In this article, however, the authors put forward literacy as a transaction technology. Freeholders in the agrarian economy that expanded during the early nineteenth century used it as such and empirical evidence is presented for its significance during the enclosure movement and in the expansion of the rural credit market. The authors also discuss the use of literacy as a proxy-variable for ‘human capital’ or ‘knowledge’ in growth accounting and stress the existence of different literacy cultures. They maintain that the functional literacy of the Swedish freeholders - reading and writing - can be used as a proxy-variable for human capital. That is not necessarily the case with the mere reading ability more typical for women, tenants on manorial land, and the lower agrarian classes. The Swedish example indicates that the literacy variables used in international comparisons actually mirror very different kinds of literacy.;1999;Agrarian transition and literacy: the case of nineteenth century Sweden;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

van Zanden, Jan Luiten;It is argued that the study of the development of the living standard of large segments of the European population between 1500 and 1800 should make use of the available evidence on prices and wages. On the basis of wage data for about twenty European cities and regions, the geographical patterns in silver and grain wages and their development over time are studied. This leads to the conclusion that there is no clear relationship between economic development (measured for example by the urbanisation ratio) and changes in the standard of living in Europe in this period. This also has implications for the hypothesis that an ‘industrious revolution’ occurred in Western Europe during this period. Alternative explanations for the fact that the per capita consumption of certain market goods increased in this period (such as changes in relative prices and an increase in labour effort as a result of falling real wages) are suggested.;1999;Wages and the standard of living in Europe, 1500-1800;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

They also affect individuals' occupational choice and personal wealth, and ultimately the incentive to migrate. Individuals found important reasons to leave under both systems, but the impartible institution encouraged more emigration.

"Ackerberg, Daniel A.; Botticini, Maristella";Historians have advanced various hypotheses regarding the spread of sharecropping in late medieval Italy and early modern France. The risk-sharing hypothesis argues that, in times of labor shortages following the Black Death, landlords used share contracts to attract risk-averse tenants. The moral-hazard/multitasking hypothesis asserts that sharecropping was an ideal contract for monitoring a tenant's effort and protecting valuable assets on the farm. The imperfect capital market hypothesis maintains that imperfect capital markets favored the expansion of share contracts.

"Alexander, Barbara J.; Libecap, Gary D.";The Agricultural Adjustment Act and the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) were cornerstones of the early New Deal, designed to cartelize agriculture and industry. When the Supreme Court annulled both acts, agricultural regulation was reinstalled within 6 weeks, following organized lobbying by farming interests, but broad industrial regulation was not reinstated. There was no corresponding lobby effort by industry to return the NIRA. To explain these differences we analyze the effect of farm/firm cost heterogeneities within commodity programs and industries on the ability of the parties to agree to and adhere to collusive regulations. We find that in the case of agriculture, because agricultural pricing and production policies were designed and implemented by low-cost producers, they were relatively self-enforcing and long-lasting. In contrast, high-cost firms in industry played a major role in setting prices and output within many of the NRA industrial codes. Consequently, these collusive policies were not self-enforcing and failed to create an effective lobby for their reinstatement.;2000;The Effect of Cost Heterogeneity in the Success and Failure of the New Deal's Agricultural and Industrial Programs;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Boulton, Jeremy;This article presents a new price series for seventeenth-century London and uses the data to construct the first cost of living index for the capital for that period. Comparison with the Phelps Brown Hopkins (PBH) series suggests that although short-term variations were very similar, there is some suggestion that prices in London were more inflationary after the middle of the seventeenth century than in the PBH series. A new London real wage series, also presented, is consequently less buoyant than that constructed by PBH for their southern building craftsmen.;2000;Food prices and the standard of living in London in the ‘century of revolution’, 1580-1700;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Cantwell, J.;Since technology is localised and context-specific, the technological trajectories of large firms tend to lock-in to particular national configurations. This article examines evidence on the industrial patterns of technological development in the largest firms originating from the US, Germany, the UK, France, Switzerland and Sweden, through their corporate patenting in the US since 1920. It is shown that in each national group the profile of development is path-dependent, but with some selected convergence between groups leading to the formation of three clusters of groups (the US and UK, German and Swiss, and French and Swedish) that share common characteristics.;2000;Technological lock-in of large firms since the interwar period;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Cunningham, Hugh;This survey of the ?adulting? of national and family economies argues that understanding of the segmentation of labour markets and of the male breadwinner has been impoverished by a failure to consider age alongside gender, and that we are at best in a situation where contextualized studies may provide some insight into reasons for the decline of child labour. With respect to family economies, there has been very little study of the timing or cause of the diminution of children's contributions, or of how, if at all, that decline is related to the rise in married women's participation in the labour force.;2000;The decline of child labour: labour markets and family economies in Europe and North America since 1830;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"EJRNÆS, METTE; Persson, Karl Gunnar";This article argues that the appropriate standard for the analysis of commodity market integration is the transport cost adjusted law of one price. A threshold error correction model that incorporates that property is developed and applied to French wheat prices in the 19th century. This type of modeling acknowledges the fact that error corrections only take place when price differentials between markets exceed transport costs. The method used produces estimates of implied transport costs, which are quite close to observed costs, and generates more accurate estimates of the adjustment speed to equilibrium price differentials between markets. Unlike previous studies this article shows that French wheat markets were well integrated by the middle of the 19th century.;2000;Market Integration and Transport Costs in France 1825–1903: A Threshold Error Correction Approach to the Law of One Price;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Fremdling, Rainer;It took the British iron industry a hundred years to transform from a small producer at high cost in the early eighteenth century, to become the leading supplier of iron products for the world market by switching from charcoal fuel to coal fuel techniques. In a long-drawn transition, the coal-using techniques were transferred to Belgium, France and Germany, in part indirectly with British iron exports embodying the new technology. Behind protective walls in Belgium and France, new ironworks imitated the British model. Traditional ironworks succeeded in integrating only parts of the new technology (i.e. puddling) and increased their productivity by applying modern fuel-saving strategies. Thus old and new coexisted for a long time. The demand for low quality railway iron made most of the British-type ironworks on the continent profitable. From 1860 on, coal iron was produced in ever better qualities which left only niches for the high quality charcoal iron.;2000;Transfer patterns of British technology to the Continent: The case of the iron industry;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The results suggest that the primary poverty head-count in York was considerably lower, at 5 to 6% of the population compared to Rowntree’s 10%.

Gilbert, R.Alton;This paper investigates whether the services of the Federal Reserve System improved the efficiency of the system in the United States for collecting checks relative to the efficiency of the system used by banks just prior to the formation of the Federal Reserve. There are two types of evidence that the Fed's services improved efficiency. First, the Reserve Banks quickly became major processors of interregional checks, even though banks could have continued to use the prior payments arrangements. The timing of the growth in Reserve Bank collection services was not consistent with the view that banks simply took advantage of a subsidy provided by the Fed. The share of checks collected by the Reserve Banks increased rapidly during the period when the Fed charged banks fees to cover their collection expenses. Second, declines in the ratios of cash to total assets of banks can be attributed to the development of the Fed's check-collection services.;2000;The Advent of the Federal Reserve and the Efficiency of the Payments System: The Collection of Checks, 1915–1930;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The ways in which a society's institutions mitigate this fundamental problem of exchange determine its efficiency and distribution. This article calls attention to the need, ability, and promise of studying the historical evolution of institutions that mitigated the fundamental problem of exchange. It elaborates on the essence of this problem and the related institutions, and demonstrates the ability and importance of studying them by drawing on various studies of historical institutions.

Grubb, Farley;Statutory laws in colonial America required that servants be given a particular set of goods upon contract completion. These laws were innovative and unprecedented. Their purpose has been interpreted as an effort to discourage servants from premature departure and to prevent ex-servants from taxing poor relief funds. These interpretations are shown to be inadequate, and an alternative explanation based on incomplete-contract theory is presented. Testable implications are developed regarding differences in end-of-contract payments by contract length, by the presence of money wages, and among indentured, convict, and apprentice contracts. The results support the incomplete-contract explanation.;2000;The Statutory Regulation of Colonial Servitude: An Incomplete-Contract Approach;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Hatton, Timothy J.; Bailey, Roy E.";In his third social survey of York carried out in 1950, Seebohm Rowntree reported a steep decline since 1936 of the percentage of households in poverty.

This article re-examines the survivingrecords from the 1950 survey, using a revised poverty line and looking more closely at the measurement of income. It also re-assesses the impact of welfare reforms on working-class poverty, and finds that poverty in York was significantly higher, and the contribution of welfare reform substantially less, than was originally reported.;2000;Seebohm Rowntree and the postwar poverty puzzle;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Horrell, Sara; Oxley, Deborah";A survey of industrial households conducted in 1889–90 is used to investigate participation in self-help organisations, such as sickness and death benefit clubs and friendly societies, and to examine whether payouts were important in seeing families through earnings crises. Formal self-help has been hypothesised to underpin the male breadwinner family form, reducing the risk incumbent in reliance on one source of earnings. The results here show that those households with multiple earners took out most insurance and also had recourse to informal strategies, such as eliciting greater labour force participation from other family members and economising on rent, when adversity carried male earnings down. Those reliant on a male breadwinner were left vulnerable. They insured less, benefits were insufficient to make up earnings shortfalls and they were unable to compensate for deficits through labour market strategies. Formal self-help was a complement to, not a substitute for, family employment.;2000;Work and prudence: Household responses to income variation in nineteenth-century Britain;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Irwin, Douglas A.;An unresolved question concerning post-Civil War U.S. industrialization is the degree to which import tariffs protected domestic manufacturers from foreign competition. This paper considers the impact of import tariffs on the domestic pig iron industry, the basic building block of the entire iron and steel industry. After reviewing the contentious political debate surrounding the pig iron duties and estimating the elasticity of substitution between domestic and imported pig iron, a standard trade model provides estimates of how tariff reductions would affect domestic prices, production, imports, and welfare. The results suggest that, had the tariff been eliminated in 1869, domestic output would have fallen by about 15% and the import market share would have risen from about 7% to nearly 30%. These relatively modest effects suggest that a substantial portion of the domestic industry could have survived a significant tariff reduction.;2000;Could the United States Iron Industry Have Survived Free Trade after the Civil War?;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Keay, Ian;Canadian income per capita has been, and continues to be, lower than American income per capita. The search for convergence opportunities, and scapegoats, has focused on perceived weaknesses within the Canadian manufacturing sector. In this paper quantitative evidence is presented which indicates that a sample of Canadian manufacturing firms have traditionally responded to changes in their input prices in a manner consistent with cost minimization and theories of induced innovation. These findings are inconsistent with claims of weakness and failure within the Canadian manufacturing sector.

Kowaleski, Maryanne;"This article argues that the expansion of marine fishing in south-western England from the late fourteenth century to the early sixteenth was part of the maritime sector's critical, but unappreciated, contribution to the rising prosperity of the region. Revenues from fishing represented a substantial supplement to the income of the fisher-farmers who dominated the industry; promoted employment in ancillary industries such as fish curing; improved the seasonal distribution of maritime work; and stimulated capital investment in ships, nets, and other equipment because of the share system that characterized the division of profits within fishing enterprises. In offering what was probably the chief source of employment within the maritime sector, fishing also provided the ?nursery of seamen? so prized by the Tudor navy, and built the navigational experience that underpinned later voyages of exploration.";2000;The expansion of the south-western fisheries in late medieval England;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Krause, W.; Puffert, Douglas J.";Before 1880, the British soda industry dominated world export markets and held a substantial share of the German domestic market. After 1880, the German soda industry displaced British imports and then became a leading exporter. We investigate the contribution to these developments of German tariffs, particularly the decline in tariffs on soda in 1873 and the increase in 1880. We develop a model, based on developments in the ‘new trade theory’, of oligopolistic competition in the German soda market, we calibrate this model using historical data, and we then apply the calibrated model in simulating the effects of counterfactual tariff rates. Results show that the 1880 tariff increase promoted, but was not decisive for, the rise of the German industry. More important were the decline in German input prices and the shift to the ammonia process for producing soda.;2000;Chemicals, strategy, and tariffs: Tariff policy and the soda industry in Imperial Germany;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Lew, Byron;The diffusion of tractors during the late 1920s proceeded more slowly than predicted by the threshold model. This lag is reinterpreted as a failure of the threshold model to incorporate farmers' expectations of future prices. Volatility in wheat prices and falling tractor prices are shown to make delaying a tractor purchase a rational decision for wheat farmers in Saskatchewan in the late 1920s. The pattern of diffusion is better explained by a threshold model modified to include uncertainty.;2000;The Diffusion of Tractors on the Canadian Prairies: The Threshold Model and the Problem of Uncertainty;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Minns, Chris;How did turn-of-the-20th-century immigrants perform in the American economy relative to native-born Americans? This article reassesses this question using data from the 1900 and 1910 American census files. I find in both cross sections that American immigrants perform well in blue-collar and white-collar occupations, with either faster growth in earnings or an outright earnings advantage over native-born Americans in the same occupational sector. Estimates of within-cohort growth reveal that the cross-sectional results do not overstate immigrant progress due to cohort effects. Immigrants also exhibit a high degree of mobility into the well-paid white-collar sector of the American economy, and the progress of the immigrant population as a whole was not slowed by the emergence of the “new” immigration.;2000;Income, Cohort Effects, and Occupational Mobility: A New Look at Immigration to the United States at the Turn of the 20th Century;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Morrisson, C.; Snyder, Wayne";France presents an unusual case because, unlike several other European countries, there are no estimates of the income distribution for the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. This is a serious deficiency because it limits the ability to understand how an important dimension of the socio-economic fabric changed during the years preceding and coinciding with the beginning of France's industrial development. In this article we provide estimates that use tax data and the social tables of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. While this data does not provide a basis for a perfectly accurate assessment of the income distribution, it does permit an evaluation of the general magnitude of inequality and how it varied in that period. The results suggest that inequality during the eighteenth century was large but decreased during the revolutionary period (1790–1815). Afterwards, and in accordance with Kuznets' hypothesis, when industrialisation began about 1830, inequality increased until sometime in the 1860s when it began its slow decline towards greater equality that characterises the twentieth century.;2000;The income inequality of France in historical perspective;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Prados De La Escosura, Leandro;"In this paper a new set of current price estimates of per capita income, adjusted for each currency's purchasing power, is presented for a sample of mainly OECD countries during more than one and a half centuries. A short-cut method is used to derive current price comparisons for countries and periods in which aggregate PPPs are not available. Current price estimates of PPP-adjusted GDP appear to be more economically sound than constant price figures, as economic agents react to current, not to constant, prices, and, therefore, would allow more appropriate cross-country comparisons of productivity and welfare. Country rankings in the new data set are different from those provided by earlier cross-country comparisons; among the new findings earlier U.S. leadership and the closer relative position of Britain and France over the 19th century can be highlighted.";2000;International Comparisons of Real Product, 1820–1990: An Alternative Data Set;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Reynard, Pierre Claude;When deployed on a large and rational scale and committed to high throughput levels, early modern manufacturing methods inevitably yielded a substantial proportion of non-standard and defective items. This proportion could only increase as the pace of work accelerated in the eighteenth century. Manufacturers regained a degree of control over their marketing strategies through the more or less rigorous sorting of this output, in a pattern suited to their markets. In so doing, they forged a transitional definition of quality that moved away from the linear pursuit of excellence that motivated their predecessors towards a relative understanding of the needs of diverse groups of buyers.;2000;Manufacturing quality in the pre-industrial age: finding value in diversity;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Ristuccia, Cristiano Andrea;This article assesses the hypothesis that the implementation of sanctions on the export of coal and oil products to Italy by the League of Nations in 1935–36 would have forced Italy to abandon her imperialistic war against Ethiopia. An analysis of the data on coal consumption in the industrial census of 1937–38 shows that Italian industry would have survived a League embargo on coal, provided that Germany continued her supply to Italy. However, the counterfactual on oil and oil derivatives proves that Italy was vulnerable to an oil embargo which included oil residuals (the main input for the petrochemical industries using oil cracking as a refining method), and fuel oil. Therefore, a solitary attempt at such an embargo by the League could have been successful even with only a limited collaboration by the United States in the form of maintaining exports to Italy at ‘peacetime levels’ for each commodity embargoed by the League.;2000;The 1935 Sanctions against Italy: Would coal and oil have made a difference?;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Schön, L.;Electricity and electrotechnical industry have taken a central position in Swedish industrial development ever since the breakthrough of the high-voltage technique in the 1890s. Some reasons for the importance of electricity are quite obvious. Due to her natural resources, Sweden had at an early stage developed many energy intensive industries such as iron and steel works and pulp and paper mills. She lacked, however, deposits of fossil fuels while the supply of water power was abundant. Hence, early on there was a strong stimulus to develop a system of generation and transmission of electrical power as well as to invest in electrotechnical equipment. Similarly, there was a strong stimulus to the development of a domestic electrotechnical engineering industry. This industry became a backbone of the more sophisticated manufacturing that spurred Swedish industrialization from the 1890s onwards.;2000;Electricity, technological change and productivity in Swedish industry, 1890-1990;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Schulze, Max-Stephan;This article addresses two issues that feature prominently in the recent historiography. First, how does the Habsburg Empire's economic performance compare to the record for other European economies in terms of levels and growth of national income? Second, to what extent was the Austrian economy subject to prolonged stagnation after 1873? These questions are examined on the basis of new annual estimates of GDP for Austria and Hungary for 1870 to 1913. The article argues, first, that over the whole period under review Austrian per capita income failed to expand at a pace broadly commensurate with the country's relative income position. The Austrian economy did not catch up with the leaders and failed to keep pace with other ‘followers’. Second, the Hungarian economy recorded a markedly higher rate of per capita income growth, placing it about mid-range in a European growth comparison. Third, the new evidence supports the notion of a ‘great depression’ in the western half of the empire (Austria) after 1873. The distinct periodicity and differential rates of Austrian and Hungarian growth are consistent with the argument that the outflow of Austrian capital to Hungary after the 1873 Vienna stock market crash was crucial in prolonging economic stagnation in Austria, whilst fuelling the first widespread wave of industrialisation in Hungary. The reversal of this capital outflow in the early 1890s was associated with an increase in Austrian economic growth and a decrease in Hungary's rate of expansion.;2000;Patterns of growth and stagnation in the late nineteenth century Habsburg economy;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Smits, J. P.;In this article time series on labour productivity in the manufacturing sector are the starting point of the analysis. Using a growth accounting framework (Cobb-Douglas production function) we try to assess to what extent increases in labour productivity are due to rises of total factor productivity or to a growth of capital intensity. The results of this accounting exercise seem to contradict the views expressed by a great number of historians who have written on this subject. By relaxing some of the strong assumptions regarding perfect competition, a new view on the determinants of long-term industrial growth can be developed. The increase in the capital/labour ratio — which undoubtedly has been the engine in the process of industrial growth — cannot be explained exclusively by changes in relative factor prices. Also changes in institutional arrangements as well as demand shocks (resulting in economies of scale) play an important role. By taking imperfect competition (and non-equilibrium prices) into consideration, the puzzling results of the Cobb-Douglas accounting experiment can be reconciled with traditional literature on this subject.;2000;The determinants of productivity growth in Dutch manufacturing, 1815-1913;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Solomou, Solomos; Catao, L.";This article constructs nominal and real multilateral effective exchange rates for Britain, France, Germany and the US during the period of the classical Gold Standard, 1879–1913. The new data indicate that the major industrial countries saw trend variations in their nominal effective rates, which appear to have been stochastic in nature, and reflected a significant exchange rate variation with non-gold countries. The movements of nominal effective rates display common trend patterns across the major industrial countries, reflecting similar trading structures in the pre-1914 period. In contrast, the movements of the real effective rates reflect national-specific influences. The implications of the new data with regard to business cycles and the international adjustment mechanism under the Gold Standard are considered.;2000;Effective exchange rates 1879-1913;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Tunzelmann, G. N. von;Technological change is often measured by economists and economic historians through productivity growth, but this article argues that technological change and productivity change are conceptually different. This proposition is demonstrated by considering the diffusion of technologies first within industries, and second across industries. In both cases, economic growth reaches higher levels when the technology becomes diffused, not when it is being generated via major technological breakthroughs. This emerges through high ratios of patents (as a measure of technological change) to industrial production when countries undergo their industrial revolutions. Finally I compare across countries, to show that leader countries developed the technologies before they developed education systems to extend them, whereas some catching-up countries probably drew on their depth of human capital to absorb new technologies from the leaders.;2000;Technology generation, technology use and economic growth;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

A vector autoregression analysis of the war debt prices indicates that an increase in the price of cotton can largely account for the large upward movement in cotton bond prices during this period.

Yousef, Tarik M.;The optimal tariff was a central concern to economists and policymakers in interwar Egypt. The government took the position that Egypt conformed to the small-country assumption in world cotton markets. Using time-series and panel data for the period 1895–1939, this article demonstrates that Egyptian long-staple cotton commanded significant market power in international markets. An optimal export tariff would have encouraged economic diversification and generated huge government revenues, making it possible to finance industrialization plans. However, the burden of taxation would have been shared by Egyptian landlords and British interests.

"Brown, J. C.; Neumeier, G.";As recent commentaries on Western European unemployment have noted, high unemployment, limited worker mobility, and a limited creation of jobs characterise the current inflexible labour market structures. This article uses a new source, extracts from the Arbeiterbücher of eight German firms found in textiles and heavy industry during the period of high industrialisation, to identify key features of the labour markets of pre-1914 Germany. The results are consistent with neo-classical economic models of labour markets.

"Capie, Forrest H.; Billings, M.";It is well-known that clearing banks in Britain did not publish their true profits until 1969. This article sets out to establish from sources in the banks' archives reliable and consistent estimates of the true profits and profitability of the major English clearing banks during the period 1920–68. The methods used and problems encountered are explained, and the results discussed, together with possible sources of data outside the banks. The impact of inflation on rates of return is considered. The question of ‘smoothing’ of published profits by the banks is addressed. The results are discussed in the context of economic theory and the perceived cartel nature of banking and some comparisons made to estimates of profitability in the wider UK economy. Finally, some interesting questions raised by the results, and which require further study, are identified.;2001;Profitability in English banking in the twentieth century;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Christodoulaki, Olga;This article challenges the established orthodoxy concerning industrial growth in Greece during the interwar period. A Paasche quantity index weighted by value-added shares for 1938 is constructed and then compared to earlier estimates. The new index indicates rapid growth though not free of interruptions in the 1920s, an early and robust recovery from the Great Depression and high rates of growth in the 1930s. By contrast with earlier estimates which imply that Greece escaped the Great Depression unscathed, the new index shows that industrial output plummeted after 1929. These findings, backed up by alternative tests, suggest that the new index gives the best possible assessment of industrial production in Greece in the interwar period. The article also explores mechanisms that stimulated industrial activity and provoked cyclical collapses of industrial output in Greece in the interwar period.;2001;Industrial growth in Greece between the wars: A new perspective;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Clark, Gregory;By the 1820s, as a result of the protracted struggle with France, the market value of the British Government debt was twice British GDP. It has been argued that this debt represented a huge institutional failure by the government, significantly slowing growth in the Industrial Revolution period by crowding out private investment. This article constructs measures of private rates of return in the years 1725–1839 and shows these imply that neither the government deficits nor the mounting debt are associated with much higher private rates of return on capital. The reason the government could issue so much debt without raising rates of return is unclear. One possibility is that crowding out was occurring, but population growth in 1770–1839 was reducing rental income as a fraction of GDP, creating a demand for other asset income so that we do not observe tightness in capital markets.;2001;Debt, deficits, and crowding out: England, 1727-1840;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Collins, William J.; Margo, Robert A.";This paper uses census IPUMS data to analyze trends in racial differences in home ownership and housing values and to examine the connection between residential segregation and the housing status of blacks relative to whites. A widening in the ownership gap between 1940 and 1960 is explained largely by the increasing concentration of blacks in central city areas, whereas a narrowing in the ownership gap between 1960 and 1980 is explained only partly by changes in the relative characteristics of the black and white populations. Residential segregation did not widen the racial gap in home ownership rates in 1940 or 1980, but it did widen the gap in housing values after 1940.;2001;Race and Home Ownership: A Century-Long View;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Using the theories of religious behavior proposed by economists and sociologists of religion and the data from the enumeration schedules of the U.S. Population censuses, we focus on the Shakers during the period between 1850 and 1870 to examine membership decisions in a religious commune. We identify trends in the changing distribution of communal membership, factors affecting the likelihood of persisting as a Shaker, and the contributions of these factors to the numerical decline of the Shakers.;2001;Membership in a Religious Commune: The Shakers, 1850–1870;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Feliciano, Zadia M.;This study estimates wage differentials between Mexican immigrants and native whites in 1910, using data not previously analyzed from the Immigration Commission Report. They are compared to estimated wage differentials from 1940 to 1990, derived from U.S. Census PUMS data. Earnings of Mexican immigrants with 6 or more years in the United States declined relative to natives from 1910 to 1990. Relative earnings of immigrants with 0 to 5 years in the United States declined after 1970. The deterioration in economic performance can be linked to a decline in the schooling of Mexican immigrants relative to the U.S. population. Changes in the education gap between the United States and Mexico and in the education of immigrants have driven this development.;2001;The Skill and Economic Performance of Mexican Immigrants from 1910 to 1990;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Fishback, Price V.; Haines, Michael R.; Kantor, Shawn Everett";The New Deal led to unprecedented involvement by the federal government in the provision of relief. Although New Deal officials argued that they sought to be nondiscriminatory in providing access to programs, various scholars have suggested that blacks received fewer benefits than whites. One method for testing the effectiveness of the New Deal at reaching households with low incomes is to examine its impact on infant mortality. In this paper we use county-level data from three subperiods during the 1930s to examine the relationship between several New Deal spending programs and black and white infant mortality in the South. Some New Deal programs contributed to a reduction in infant mortality, but other factors may have been strong contributors to a long-term secular decline in infant mortality. Meanwhile, some of the New Deal programs appear to have been nondiscriminatory or even more beneficial for blacks than for whites, while others appear to have had differential effects that favored whites.;2001;The Impact of the New Deal on Black and White Infant Mortality in the South;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Fratianni, Michele; Spinelli, Franco";Fiscal dominance, the extent to which government deficits condition the growth of the money supply, has been the prevailing regime in Italian monetary history since political unification in 1861. The nature of the institutional structure linking budget deficits to monetary base creation has changed over time. In the early days, the profit-seeking banks of issue intermittently exceeded the legal ceiling on their outstanding currency in order to lend to the government. Public finance exerted stronger influence on monetary policy, first in the 1930s and later in the 1970s, when fiscal dominance reached its high point. In the 1990s fiscal dominance held but in the opposite direction. To meet the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty and qualify for the European Monetary Union, Italian policy makers had to grant independence to the central bank and drastically curtail budget deficits.;2001;Fiscal Dominance and Money Growth in Italy: The Long Record;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Galassi, Francesco L.;This article presents a quantitative test of the oft-repeated view that Italy's backward and poor South suffered from low ‘social capital’, a tendency to defect from co-operative engagements. The problem with such assertions is that they run the risk of taking as evidence in favour of the hypothesis the very observations that need to be explained. The analysis carried out in this work tries to break out of this impasse by analysing the conditions under which it was ex ante welfare-improving for farmers in early twentieth century Italy to join an unlimited liability rural co-operative bank which would give them access to cheaper credit, but also exposed them to the risk of their neighbours' defection. These ‘co-ops’ are a prime testing ground for the cultural explanation in that they spread rapidly throughout Northern Italy in the late nineteenth century, but never gained a similar popularity in the South. I estimate the switching function for these co-ops in different parts of the country to test whether Northern and Southern farmers faced significantly different choice sets when making the decision to join. Identical choice sets but differential responses would of course favour the cultural explanation of the South's backwardness. The results suggest that for the same parameter values, the choice sets for North and South were indeed different.;2001;Measuring social capital: culture as an explanation of Italy's economic dualism;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Greasley, David; Madsen, Jakob B.; Oxley, Les";Romer's (1990) influential hypothesis argues that uncertainty associated with the stock market crash in October 1929 caused a collapse in durable goods spending in 1930. On the basis of alternative indicators of uncertainty, new measures of expenditures, and two models of consumption, we contend that income uncertainty also reduced nondurable spending and had powerful detrimental effects beyond 1930. Income uncertainty peaked in the year following the gold standard crisis of September 1931 and contributed substantially to the more severe durable and nondurable spending declines of 1932.;2001;Income Uncertainty and Consumer Spending during the Great Depression;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Green, Alan G.; MacKinnon, Mary";Using a new sample of individual-level data compiled from the manuscript returns of the 1901 Census of Canada, this article examines the assimilation of male wage-earning immigrants (mainly from the UK) in Montreal and Toronto. Unlike studies of post-World War II immigrants to Canada, and some recent studies of 19th century immigration to the United States, we find slow assimilation to the earnings levels of native-born English mother-tongue Canadians. While immigrants from the UK were about as likely as the Canadian-born to be in craft jobs, they were much less likely to work in the clerical sector. Within the blue-collar sector, English and Scottish immigrants were at little disadvantage.;2001;The Slow Assimilation of British Immigrants in Canada: Evidence from Montreal and Toronto, 1901;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Haines, Robin; McDonald, John; Shlomowitz, Ralph";Using a newly published database on the transatlantic slave trade prepared at Harvard University's W. E. B. Du Bois Institute and a new methodology, this article reevaluates the relationship between slave mortality and the length of the middle passage on nine routes during the 18th and 19th centuries. For each route, interactive regressions are used to estimate the influence of factors such as crowding on-board, season of departure, and whether stopovers were made on a voyage. Death rates that track the average time pattern of deaths on the voyages of each route are calculated. These rates indicate whether deaths mainly occurred in the early part, middle section, or latter part of a voyage. Hence we are now closer to understanding whether deaths on individual routes largely resulted from preboarding or on-board conditions or an interaction between preboarding and on-board conditions. The relationships between mortality during three phases of the voyage, the coasting period, the middle passage, and the postarrival period, are also assessed as are the connections between slave and crew deaths.;2001;Mortality and Voyage Length in the Middle Passage Revisited;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Hart, Robert A.;On their intensive margins, firms in the British engineering industry adjusted to the severe falls in demand during the 1930s Depression by cutting hours of work. This provided an important means of reducing labor input and marginal labor costs through movements from overtime to short-time schedules. Nominal basic wage rates dropped relatively modestly while their real wage equivalents continued to rise throughout the trough years of the recession. This paper provides detailed labor market and empirical analysis of the hours and wage adjustment processes.

"Harver, Barbara; Oeppen, Jim";A comparison between secular hospitals and monastic infirmaries introduces a discussion of the duration and seasonality of the illnesses of the monks of Westminster in two periods: 1297/8 to 1354/5 and 1381/2 to 1416/17. A change in the duration of illnesses is related to change in the conventions of treatment after the Black Death of 1348/9. The resemblance between the seasonal pattern of morbidity in this sample and that of mortality among male adults in the early modern period is discussed. It is suggested that the latter pattern may extend into the late middle ages.;2001;Patterns of morbidity in late medieval England: a sample from Westminster Abbey;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Hefeker, C.;This article revisits the German system of fiscal federalism between unification in 1871 and hyper-inflation in 1923. I argue that the ill designed fiscal system led to systematically excessive debt for the Reich. The system was the outcome of overlapping distributional conflicts between centre and states, and between capital and labour. It was also responsible for the debt problems arising in World War I and the unsuccessful attempts at fiscal reforms during and after the war. Ultimately, these distributional conflicts contributed to the hyper-inflation in Germany. The German example also has implications for the debate about fiscal federalism in the European Union.;2001;The agony of central power: Fiscal federalism in the German Reich;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Horrell, Sara; Humphries, Jane; Voth, Hans-Joachim";A model illustrates the intergenerational transmission of poverty through the effects of shocks to family income on children's general education and health and subsequently on their capacity to work and earn as adults. Evidence for 19th-century Britain shows that being fatherless, and so likely poor, had an adverse effect on children's human capital acquisition. However, policy intervention in the form of the Old Poor Law blocked the transmission of poverty and avoided permanent pauperism. Even at an early stage of development, redistribution emerges as a positive contribution to economic growth, not a luxury that poor countries can ill afford.;2001;Destined for Deprivation: Human Capital Formation and Intergenerational Poverty in Nineteenth-Century England;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Huff, W. G.;This article uses an entitlements approach to analyse the divergent impacts of the 1930s great depression on the diverse population groups of Singapore and its Malay Peninsula hinterland. Contrary to a revisionist argument in the literature that the depression had comparatively little effect on South-east Asia, Singapore was considerably affected. This arose more from the externality of migration of unemployed hinterland workers to the city than from a shift in the terms of trade against Singapore producers. Only the ?safety valve' of mass emigration, promoted by colonial policy, enabled Singapore to escape the depression with a sharp, if relatively brief, drop in welfare and serious distress for its inhabitants.;2001;Entitlements, destitution, and emigration in the 1930s Singapore great depression;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Hunt, E. H.; Pam, S. J.";This article focuses upon the neglected role of agriculture in Britain's relative economic decline. Landlords and farmers stand accused of responding inadequately to the flood of American cereal imports. Land-use changes are analysed by soil type and access to urban markets, revealing a range of opportunities and restraints, and an appropriate variety of responses. Other aspects of agriculturalists' responses to depression remain to be examined, but this exercise finds no evidence of significant managerial shortcomings. Rather, the interim verdict is similar to that on the performance of those British industrialists whose once-savaged reputations have been partly redeemed by the researches of McCloskey, Sandberg, et al.;2001;Managerial failure in late Victorian Britain?: Land use and English agriculture;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Irwin, James R.; O'Brien, Anthony Patrick";The extent of economic gains by African Americans in the decades after slavery is in dispute. Using a newly constructed data set, compiled from the manuscript census schedules and other sources, we find that African Americans in the Mississippi Delta experienced substantial income gains between 1880 and 1910. These gains can be attributed partly to African Americans moving into higher paying occupations—in particular, moving from being farm laborers to being farm operators—and partly to an increase in the incomes received from given occupations.;2001;Economic Progress in the Postbellum South?

Kaukiainen, Y.;It is commonly believed that not much happened in the transmission of information before the introduction of the electric telegraph. This article, however, argues that this was not the case, that quite a substantial improvement in the speed of information transmission had already taken place a few decades before this technical breakthrough. Between 1820 and 1860, global dispatch times diminished remarkably, on average to about a third of what they had been around 1820. This implies that on most routes the improvement during these three decades amounted to more saved days than was achieved after the introduction of the electric telegraph. The development can be described as an evolution which started in Europe in the 1830s and was diffused gradually all over the world. The first transcontinental communications to benefit were those across the North Atlantic and to the Far East, with South America, Africa and Australia clearly trailing behind. The ‘take-off’ was initially connected with the introduction of steamships on coastal or short sea routes and subsequently on increasingly long ocean voyages. However, even traditional overland mail-coach connections improved as also did sailing-ship (‘packet’) connections over the North Atlantic until the late 1830s. It was only in the late 1840s and 1850s that railways started to shrink distances within Continental Europe.;2001;Shrinking the world: Improvements in the speed of information transmission, c. 1820-1870;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Klug, Adam;This article analyses three crucial elections which determined the fate of free trade in Britain and Germany. These are the elections of 1906 in the UK and 1877 and 1878 in Germany. We examine the political economy of trade policy by examining the voting patterns of the electorates in their choice of commercial policy. The underlying hypothesis to be explored is that voting behaviour was based on the economic interests of the constituents as determined by the international trade performance of the sector in which they were employed. An econometric model reveals the degree to which the support for and opposition to free trade was based on occupational characteristics and well explains the outcome for Germany in 1877. The analysis for Britain extends previous work by Irwin (1994) by assessing how considerations of turnout, religion and restricted voting rights alter the results of his original model. In 1878 in Germany religious affiliation and turnout played a significant role in the result although not in the ways assumed by historians, in particular the outcome of the election was not determined by the mobilisation of agricultural labourers on the great estates. The results of estimating the model shows that franchise restrictions contributed to the victory of free trade in Britain, but their absence had no impact on the result in Germany.;2001;Why Chamberlain failed and Bismarck succeeded: The political economy of tariffs in British and German elections;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Ransom, Roger L.; Sutch, Richard";Since One Kind of Freedom was published in 1977 there have been enormous advances in computer technology and statistical software, and an impressive expansion of microlevel historical data sets. In this essay we “reconsider” our earlier findings on the consequences of emancipation in terms of what might be accomplished using the new technology, methods, and data. We employ the entire sample of 11,202 farms collected for the Southern Economic History Project, not the subsample used to prepare One Kind of Freedom. We revisit the question of declining production of foodstuffs, examining the data this time on a farm-by-farm basis. We conclude that 30% of farms in the cotton regions were “locked-in” to cotton production and another 16% were producing too much food in an effort to avoid the trap of debt peonage. Using probit methods to control for the effects of age, farm size, literacy, family workers, and willingness to assume risk, we find that race accounts for two-thirds of the gap between black and white ownership of farms. Comparing sharecropping and renting, we find that race was much less of a factor in tenure choice. We note that these efforts only scratch the surface of what remains to be done.;2001;One Kind of Freedom: Reconsidered (and Turbo Charged);Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Ritschl, Albrecht O.;This article re-examines the hypothesis of Hirschman and Child that Nazi trade policy before the Second World War exploited the smaller European countries. Archival evidence on foreign exchange balances for 1938-40 shows that trade policies alone had only a small effect. Earlier dependence of south-eastern Europe on Germany was caused partly by the collapse of south-east European trade with the Soviet Union. Adjusted figures reveal a regional pattern similar to that of 1913. Generally, exploitation began with military occupation, but was then on a massive scale. Results again confirm Milward's findings on the westward orientation of the German war economy.;2001;Nazi economic imperialism and the exploitation of the small: evidence from Germany’s secret foreign exchange balances, 1938-1940;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Scott, Peter M.;This article explores the nature and impact of path dependence in British rail coal haulage before 1939. It examines the factors which locked Britain's railways into a system of small coal wagons with highly fragmented ownership, the cost penalties of this system, and the reasons that attempts at modernization were unsuccessful. The analysis highlights the importance of decentralized ownership of a highly durable installed base of complementary infrastructure. Technical and institutional interrelatedness blocked incremental modernization, while the political requirement to compensate private wagon owners for the loss of their wagon stock made wholesale rationalization financially unattractive.;2001;Path Dependence and Britain's “Coal Wagon Problem”;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Segers, Y.;This article presents the results of an extensive inquiry into urban consumption of foodstuffs in Flanders between 1800 and 1860. The octroi tax, an indirect tax levied on various consumer items, formed the principal source. During the initial phase of Belgian industrialisation the inhabitants of the eight cities under study (Antwerp, Bruges, Brussels, Courtrai, Ghent, Lokeren, Leuven and Mechelen) experienced a sharp decrease in the consumption of bread grains, meat, fish, beer, wine and gin. A number of other indicators suggest at the same time an accelerated widening of the gap between rich and poor. This process of impoverishment and pauperisation, which occurred in all cities (small or large, industrial or merchant centre), is explained as a result of Malthusian tensions. The rapid population growth, which started around 1750, generated the division of arable land and a sharp increase in land prices. The growing demand for food, stagnating agricultural output, and the trade and agricultural policy of the government led to a significant increase in the price level of foodstuffs.

Finally, it is argued that these practices were motivated by efficiency and attracted quality workers, reduced turnover, screened workers, and promoted honesty and effort.;2001;Salaries and Career Opportunities in the Banking Industry: Evidence from the Personnel Records of the Union Bank of Australia;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Stogbauer, C.;This article analyses the impact of the onset of the Great Depression on voting patterns at the local level in the final years of the Weimar Republic. A special pooled longitudinal/cross sectional, fixed-effects approach with spatial autocorrelation (EGLS) is used in order to simultaneously estimate the popularity determinants for the entire system of political parties for each of the 830 localities in our data set. By analysing the determinants for the vote shares of all major parties/party blocs we demonstrate unequivocally that the economic crisis was the crucial prerequisite for the political collapse of the Weimar Republic. In contrast to other empirical studies in this field, we use an essentially longitudinal approach by which we can completely avoid the problems associated with ecological inference and show that unemployment had a strong positive effect in favour of the National Socialists. Because of using aggregated data, we cannot, however, distinguish between egotropic and sociotropic voting behaviour.;2001;The radicalisation of the German electorate: Swinging to the Right and the Left in the twilight of the Weimar Republic;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Sundstrom, William A.;The extraordinary unemployment rates of black women during the Great Depression caused a sizeable number to leave the labor force as “discouraged workers.” Consequently, while married white women entered the labor force in increasing numbers, the participation rate of married black women stagnated.

This article adds support to the view of black economic progress as episodic in nature, with the Depression as a period of relative retrenchment for African Americans.;2001;Discouraging Times: The Labor Force Participation of Married Black Women, 1930–1940;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

However, reparations played a useful role in the construction of earlier peace treaties. This article examines the payment of reparations by the French after the Napoleonic Wars. By most measures, these reparations were the largest ever fully paid; and they imposed a high cost on the economy in terms of lost output, consumption, and diminished capital stock.

The hypothesis is tested by examining the structure of the rules and then contrasting them with the rules governing privateers, the army, and the navy over time.

"Alston, Lee J.; Dupré, Ruth; Nonnenmacher, Tomas";Anti-smoking legislation in North America reached its peak early in the last century. In 1903, the Canadian Parliament passed a resolution to prohibit the manufacture, importation, and sale of cigarettes. Fifteen states in the United States banned the sale of cigarettes and 37 states considered prohibitory legislation. In both the United States and Canada, prohibition was part of the Progressive Movement. Cigarette prohibition was special interest regulation, but it was also the means by which crusaders sought to alter public behavior. In the United States, the cigarette lobby opposed cigarette prohibition while in Canada the French-Canadians offered the most vociferous opposition.

These are the earliest comprehensive estimates available on this topic. Although the typical manufacturing plant operated full-time, part-year operation was not uncommon. Indeed, the likelihood of part-year operation varied across industries and location and with plant characteristics, and workers in such plants received higher monthly wages than those in firms that operated year-round, compensating them for the loss of work and possible inconvenience.;2002;PART-YEAR OPERATION IN NINETEENTH-CENTURY AMERICAN MANUFACTURING: EVIDENCE FROM THE 1870 AND 1880 CENSUSES;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

It focuses on product innovation in manufactured commodities as this engages with economic, technological and cultural theories. Recent theories of consumer demand are applied to the invention of commodities in the eighteenth century; special attention is given to the process of imitation in product innovation. The theoretical framework for imitation can be found in evolutionary theories of memetic transmission, in archaeological theories of skeuomorphous, and in eighteenth-century theories of taste and aesthetics. Inventors, projectors, economic policy makers, and commercial and economic writers of the period dwelt upon the invention of new British products.

Bodenhorn, Howard;In the early nineteenth century, the Suffolk Bank established a regional banknote clearing network. Despite the benefits offered, many of the system's member banks were unhappy with it and quickly affiliated with an alternative clearing network as soon as it appeared. The reason for the quick abandonment of the Suffolk system was that it failed to price its network clearing services efficiently. Pressured by large Boston banks to shift the costs of the system to small country banks, the Suffolk engaged in inefficient cross-subsidization. Once a competitor emerged that priced efficiently, it drove the Suffolk from the market.;2002;MAKING THE LITTLE GUY PAY: PAYMENTS-SYSTEM NETWORKS, CROSS-SUBSIDIZATION, AND THE COLLAPSE OF THE SUFFOLK SYSTEM.;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Bordo, Michael D.; Choudhri, Ehsan U.; Schwartz, Anna J.";"The recent consensus view that the gold standard was the leading cause of the worldwide Great Depression 1929–1933 stems from the two propositions: (1) Under the gold standard, deflationary shocks were transmitted between countries and, (2) for most countries, continued adherence to gold prevented monetary authorities from offsetting banking panics and blocked their recoveries. In this article we contend that the second proposition applies only to small open economies with limited gold reserves. This was not the case for the United States, the largest country in the world, holding massive gold reserves. The United States was not constrained from using expansionary policy to offset banking panics, deflation, and declining economic activity. Simulations, based on a model of a large open economy, indicate that expansionary open market operations by the Federal Reserve at two critical junctures (October 1930 to February 1931; September 1931 through January 1932) would have been successful in averting the banking panics that occurred, without endangering convertibility. Indeed had expansionary open market purchases been conducted in 1930, the contraction would not have led to the international crises that followed.";2002;Was Expansionary Monetary Policy Feasible during the Great Contraction?

"Broadberry, Stephen N.; Ghosal, Sayantan";The United States overtook Britain in comparative aggregate productivity levels primarily as a result of trends in services rather than trends in industry. This occurred during the transition from customized, low-volume, high-margin business organized on the basis of networks to standardized, high-volume, low-margin business with hierarchical management from the 1870s. This transformation from the counting house to the modern office was dependent on technologies that improved communications and information processing. The technologies were slower to diffuse in Britain as a result of lower levels of education and stronger labor-force resistance to intensification.;2002;From the Counting House to the Modern Office: Explaining Anglo-American Productivity Differences in Services, 1870–1990;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Broadberry, Stephen N.; Marrison, Andrew";This article provides three types of evidence for external economies of scale in the Lancashire cotton industry. Anglo-American productivity differences are used to demon-strate external economies at the industry level. Econometric evidence of dynamic (Marshall-Arrow-Romer) external economies of localization in spinning and weaving is provided using individual earnings data. A case study of a merchant firm demonstrates the build-up of dynamic (Jacobs) externalities of urbanization. It is argued that the persistence of a large merchant community generating external economies of scale helped to delay Britain's loss of comparative advantage to low wage producers.;2002;External economies of scale in the Lancashire cotton industry, 1900–1950;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Carlos, Ann M.; Moyen, Nathalie; Hill, Jonathan";Price bubbles provide a unique opportunity to test whether investors act rationally and have sufficient knowledge of the economic environment in which they trade. We focus our attention on the 1720 South Sea bubble episode as experienced by a company not involved in governmental debt financing—the Royal African Company. Following the example of the South Sea Company, the Royal African Company lent its funds to equityholders at a preferential rate. Recognizing this benefit along with the announced dividends explains a large portion of the bubble. Furthermore, the unexplained residual does not behave like an exploding bubble, casting doubt that speculative excess motivated market participants in 1720. Our findings are indeed consistent with investor rationality, and the unexplained residual suggests that we are missing information that was available to the British financial market in 1720.;2002;Royal African Company Share Prices during the South Sea Bubble;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Chandra, Siddharth;Movements in wages for subjects of the Netherlands Indies for the period 1908–1917 are analyzed. The analysis reveals a sharp increase in inequality between the ethnic indigenous and Chinese communities between 1910 and 1916, the period of the birth and rise of the anti-Chinese Sarekat Islam movements in Java. It also reveals that this inequality was most severe in a number of residencies of Java, where the movements first took hold. While there is statistical evidence of a link between interracial wage differentials and anti-Chinese violence, there is no link between absolute wages and violence. This evidence suggests that “relative deprivation” is important in understanding ethnic tension.;2002;Race, Inequality, and Anti-Chinese Violence in the Netherlands Indies;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Clark, Gregory;I use the rents and prices of land held by charities in England to estimate statistically nominal and real farmland rental values, including payments for tithe and taxes, from 1500 to 1912. The series measures rental values when land was rented in a competitive market, not the average rents paid by land occupiers which would often be lower because of customary leases. An advantage of the methods used here over older ones is that the sampling error in the series can be calculated. The series show rapid shifts of income toward landowners and away from wages around 1600 and 1800, but back toward wages after 1870. Land rental values are much higher before 1820 than in the recent series of Michael Turner, John Beckett and Bethany Afton. This implies that agricultural productivity was high before 1800: higher than could be consistent with an agricultural revolution either alongside or before the Industrial Revolution.;2002;Land rental values and the agrarian economy: England and Wales, 1500-1914;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Clark, Gregory;Housing was a major item of English consumer expenditure. Yet little is known of its average quality or rental cost. I estimate average rents, constant-quality rents, and housing quality from 1550 to 1909. Constant-quality rents rose substantially relative to other costs of living during the Industrial Revolution. This probably explains why, despite rising real wages, housing quality appears to have declined from 1760 to 1860. There were, however, substantial quality gains in the eighteenth century prior to the Industrial Revolution. The implications of these new series for measurement of growth during the Industrial Revolution are briefly explored.;2002;Shelter from the storm: housing and the Industrial Revolution, 1550-1909;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Della Paolera, Gerardo; Taylor, Alan M.";Argentina’s money and banking system was hit hard by the Great Depression. Banks were awash with bad assets when gold convertibility was suspended in December 1929. We argue for an explanation of the crisis that focuses on the inside–outside money relationship in a system of fractional-reserve banking and gold-standard rules with a tension between internal and external convertibility. After financial fragility appeared in the 1914–1927 suspension, resumption in 1928 was probably unsustainable due to the problems of the financial system and a dynamic model illustrates the point well. When the state bank became insolvent, the currency board started bailing out the system using high-powered money. Thus, came about the demise of the currency board and the creation of a central bank in 1935. As one of its first substantive actions, the central bank engineered a bailout of the banking system at a massive social cost. The parallels with recent developing-country crises are remarkable and the implications for the institutional design of monetary and banking systems are considered.;2002;Internal versus external convertibility and emerging-market crises: lessons from Argentine history;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Di Matteo, Livio; Herbert Emery, J. C.";Our analysis of the life insurance holdings of male probated decedents in Ontario in 1892 demonstrates a negative correlation between the level of personal wealth and the demand for life insurance. Consistent with the theoretical literature on the demand for life insurance, and counter to the findings in much of the empirical literature, self-insurance was a substitute for market purchases of life insurance where self-insurance capabilities are a by-product of wealth accumulation. Our evidence suggests that households primarily demanded life insurance when they lacked accumulated reserves, or wealth, for self-insurance, often early in the life cycle. The growth of the life insurance industry reflected the growth of urban population relative to farming and an increased dependence on the head of household’s earnings.;2002;Wealth and the demand for life insurance: evidence from Ontario, 1892;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Dimitri, C.;Between 1890 and 1930, the development of refrigerated rail transportation enabled a national U.S. apple industry to emerge. Apples were shipped over long distances, and sold in the terminal market on consignment or FOB, or in the auction market. There were frequent disputes over quality, caused by the long distances between buyers and sellers, the natural decline in apple quality over time, and because farmer and railroad moral hazard could accelerate quality deterioration. By 1930, apple transactions relied on government quality standards and inspection services. Evidence suggests that these institutions emerged in response to contract-enforcement and quality problems.;2002;CONTRACT EVOLUTION AND INSTITUTIONAL INNOVATION: MARKETING PACIFIC-GROWN APPLES FROM 1890 TO 1930.;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The evidence suggests, first, that the predominance of southerners among Democrats who opposed the FLSA resulted in part from the widespread disfranchisement of low-wage workers in the South and, second, that Democratic opposition to the FLSA in the House of Representatives reflected a weakening of the coalition that had passed so much legislation during the earlier years of the New Deal.;2002;DEMOCRATIC OPPOSITION TO THE FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT OF 1938;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Fohlin, Caroline;Previous researchers argue that the legal and regulatory environment helped shape the German financial system in the nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, with particular emphasis on the damaging effects of the stock exchange law of 1896. This article finds that the stock exchange law of 1896 exerted little measurable impact on the growth and concentration of the universal banking system or on the business turnover of universal banks relative to securities markets. The article also shows that the English commercial banking sector and the German universal banking sector underwent similar movements toward concentration between 1884 and 1920 (both accelerating after 1912), despite no corresponding regulatory changes in England — further suggesting that consolidation of universal banking resulted from factors other than the 1896 law.;2002;Regulation, taxation and the development of the German universal banking system, 1884-1913;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

We also examine spatial and temporal aspects of market integration. Specifically, we examine seasonal fluctuations in prices and analyze regional integration of markets for butter. We test the null hypothesis of no integration before and after the advent and adoption of refrigerated shipping and warehousing using 31 years of monthly data. We find strong evidence of spatially integrated markets after adoption. Our results indicate that the adoption of mechanical refrigeration brought about a significant dampening of seasonal fluctuations of butter prices and a tightening of spatial price linkages. We conclude that the adoption of mechanical refrigeration had a significant impact on both temporal and spatial butter price relationships.;2002;Mechanical Refrigeration and the Integration of Perishable Commodity Markets;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Hausman, William J.; Neufeld, John L.";We provide evidence that the problem of raising capital in the early days of the U.S. electric-utility industry motivated industry leaders to embrace state rate-of-return regulation in return for a secure territorial monopoly. Utility executives anticipated that this would lead to a reduction in borrowing costs. Using firm-level bond data for 1910–1919, we estimate a model and find that state regulation led to lower borrowing costs but that the magnitude of the reduction was small.

Hiscox, Michael J.;Interindustry factor mobility is a crucial determinant of the income-distribution effects of exogenous changes in relative commodity prices. This examination of interindustry variation in wages and profits using data from manufacturing industries from 1820 to 1990 suggests that interindustry factor mobility may be strongly related to the processes of industrialization. Development in the nineteenth century produced a sharp rise in mobility (a decline in interindustry wage and profit differentials) due to rapid improvements in transportation and the introduction of factory production. Twentieth-century industrialization, involving greater reliance on specialized equipment and knowledge, reduced levels of interindustry mobility.;2002;INTERINDUSTRY FACTOR MOBILITY AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE: EVIDENCE ON WAGE AND PROFIT DISPERSION ACROSS U.S. INDUSTRIES, 1820–1990;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The purchasing powers of different income classes depend on how relative prices move. Relative prices affected real inequality more strongly in earlier centuries than in the twentieth. Between 1500 and about 1800, staple food and fuels became dearer, while luxury goods, especially servants, became cheaper, greatly widening the inequality of lifestyles.

Increases in loan concentrations followed declines in capitalization at insured state banks. However, we find no statistically significant relationship between loan concentrations and capitalization at uninsured national banks or at state banks before the introduction of deposit insurance.

Houpt, Stefan Oliver;By contrasting the optimal with the actual location of Spain's main production centre in Bilbao, we have tried to resolve the enigma that mislocation introduced an important welfare loss in Spain's industrialisation. This analysis considers the optimal location for integrated steel mills in Spain from their origins (1880s) until the Spanish Civil War (1936–39). The first part of this article introduces the relevant aspects for formalising a model, while Section 2 applies the methodology. The numerical results show how the major technical change — the reduction of coal consumption — affected each of the alternative sites. They also allow us to identify ‘the overall optimum site’, which was not Bilbao. Our final conclusions confirm that the actual centre of iron and steel production during the period considered was a second-best location. The cost in terms of direct welfare loss, in terms of captive markets and rent-seeking used to maintain this second-best solution, and the ultimate consequences of mislocation, point to an inefficiency which has changed the course of modern Spanish industrialisation.;2002;Putting Spanish steel on the map: The location of Spanish integrated steel, 1880-1936;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Huberman, Michael; Young, Denise";"The received view is that, across countries and time, strike dimensions trace an empirical regularity. The incidence and duration of contract strikes move in opposite directions over the business cycle: incidence is procyclical and duration countercyclical. The Canadian experience in the interwar years was different. Strike incidence was independent of the business cycle and strike durations fell steadily over the period. A distinct pattern emerged. The 1920s saw a decline in strike activity and steady losses for workers; in the 1930s strike activity gained momentum and there were more worker wins. Our interpretation of this extraordinary episode is based on a new data set collected for the period 1920 to 1939. We evaluate strikes in the context of a war-of-attrition model and estimate the probability of strike outcomes (success, failure, or compromise) and capitulation times (for firms and workers) as functions of firm and striker characteristics. We find that workers capitulated first in the 1920s because firms used replacement workers as part of a larger strategy to break the union movement. In the 1930s, it was firms' turn to capitulate first because they had cut back on resources to fight strikes, even as workers became more belligerent.";2002;Hope against Hope: Strike Activity in Canada, 1920–1939;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The most important of these commercial links were the grain routes from Mecklenburg, Pomerania, and Prussia to Norway, England, and the Netherlands established on a regular basis c . 1300.

Kanzaka, Junichi;What factors played the principal role in determining the level of villein rents in thirteenth?century England? Historians have assumed three factors: economic and demographic forces, seigneurial power, and custom. This analysis of the Hundred Rolls of 1279?80 for Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire, Oxfordshire, and Warwickshire indicates that community custom was the most important factor. It is only on ecclesiastical estates in Huntingdonshire that seigneurial power had a decisive influence in imposing heavy labour services on villeins. Furthermore, since villeins were protected by custom, the level of their rents was usually lower than that of competitive freehold rents, which reflected market forces.;2002;Villein rents in thirteenth–century England: an analysis of the Hundred Rolls of 1279–1280;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The provision of these subsidies had negative effects on the market by maintaining the purchasing power of households for consumer goods and by increasing the budget deficit.

Lee, Chulhee;"The labor-force participation rate (LFPR, hereafter) of older males in the United States has fallen dramatically over the last 120 years.For the discussions of the long-term trend of the labor force participation rate of older males prior to 1940, see Durand, Labor Force; Long, Labor Force; Ransom and Sutch, “Labor” and “Trend”; Moen, Essays and “Labor”; Margo “Labor Force Participation”; Carter and Sutch, “Fixing the Facts”; and Lee, “Long-Term Unemployment.” In 1880 nearly four out of five men 65 and older were gainfully employed. Today, only 15 percent of males at those ages participate in the labor market. Such a sharp decline in the labor market activity of older men has been regarded as one of the most marked changes in the U.S. labor market that the twentieth century witnessed. In addition to the secular rise in retirement, the sharp increase in the share of the aged population has made this retirement behavior a major social issue in the post–World War II era. Many economists have attributed this phenomenon to the implementation and expansion of social insurance programs, especially Social Security.See Boskin, “Social Security”; Parsons, “Decline” and “Male Retirement Behavior”; Hurd and Boskin, “Effect”; and Gruber and Wise, Social Security. See Krueger and Pischke, “Effect”; and Lee “Rise” for some evidence against this argument. However, about half of the fall in the LFPR of older men took place prior to 1940, when the public programs for old-age security were not as yet well developed. Though a number of factors have been suggested, including rising retirement incomes and a changing industrial environment, it is not entirely clear what caused the exit of older workers from the work force during this period.Costa, Evolution.";2002;SECTORAL SHIFT AND THE LABOR-FORCE PARTICIPATION OF OLDER MALES IN THE UNITED STATES, 1880–1940;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Libecap, G., & Hansen, Z.;"The weather-information problem faced by settlers of semi-arid regions of the Great Plains hindered their attempts to adapt their crops, techniques, and farm sizes. Episodes of homestead settlement and collapse in western Kansas in 1893–1894 and in eastern Montana in 1917–1921 are examined. A Bayesian learning model indicates how new climate information was incrementally incorporated to revise views of agricultural prospects. Primary data show homesteaders' lagged response to new drought information and illustrate drought's differential impact on small farms. Dryfarming doctrine, despite its optimistic claims, was an imperfect response to drought. Indeed, some dryfarming practices hastened homestead failure.

"Lindmark, Magnus; Vikstrom, P.";In this article we investigate the relationship between structural change — defined as the distribution of value added between the industrial branches — and transformation pressure in Swedish industry 1870–1993. The objective is to investigate signs of a change in this relationship during the 1970s. Quite surprisingly, the investigation showed the change occurred in the early 1950s. The rate of structural change is estimated by using an angle measure and is then compared with the dispersion of gross profit shares (GPS) between nine branches of Swedish industry. The dispersion of GPS is used as an indicator of the transformation pressure. A good correlation was present until the early 1950s, when a change in the relationship between GPS dispersion and actual structural change was observed. Furthermore, we suggest that the change in the relationship may be understood either as the result of institutional factors affecting the resource allocation or as an outcome of growth itself, supported by the hypothesis that a higher capital intensity led to market concentration and natural barriers to entry, possibly reinforced by a higher degree of specialisation;2002;The determinants of structural change: Transformation pressure and structural change in Swedish manufacturing industry, 1870-1993;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

This article analyzes a rare source of historical wage data for nonwhite populations. An American labor-market survey of Manila in 1900 revealed that average Chinese wages were about a third higher than Filipino wages. This differential appears to have been in large part an overtime premium that compensated Chinese for their longer workdays; partly it reflected Chinese segregation into higher-paying industries.

"Murray, John E.; Herndon, Ruth Wallis";After beginning as a kind of outdoor poor relief, long-term indenture of poor children evolved into a specialized form of craft apprenticeship. Analysis of indenture terms indicates that relationships between end payments (“freedom dues”) and education and training clauses varied by region. In Boston, education and training clauses were associated negatively with freedom-dues clauses, but in Rhode Island and Charleston the relationship was positive. Variation in freedom dues to suit the needs of the master or overseer of the poor, without reference to the worker-child's own interests, resulted from the child's lack of advocacy during contract formation.;2002;MARKETS FOR CHILDREN IN EARLY AMERICA: A POLITICAL ECONOMY OF PAUPER APPRENTICESHIP;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Ó Gráda, Cormac; Chevet, Jean-Michel";"How—and how well—do food markets function in famine conditions? The controversy surrounding this question may benefit from historical perspective. Here we study two massive famines that struck France between 1693 and 1710, killing over two million people. In both cases the impact of harvest failure was exacerbated by wartime demands on the food supply; we ask whether the crises were exacerbated yet further by a failure of markets to function as they did in normal times. The evidence, we conclude, is most consistent with the view that markets in fact helped alleviate these crises, albeit modestly.

"O’Rourke, Kevin Hjortshøj; Williamson, Jeffrey G.";This study documents the boom in Europe's imports from Asia and the Americas between 1500 and 1800 and explores its causes. There was no commodity-price convergence between continents, suggesting that declining trade barriers were not the cause of the boom. Thus, it must have been caused by some combination of European import demand and foreign export supply. The behavior of the relative price of foreign importables in European cities should tell us which mattered most and when: we provide the evidence and offer a model which is used to decompose the sources of Europe's overseas trade boom.;2002;AFTER COLUMBUS: EXPLAINING EUROPE'S OVERSEAS TRADE BOOM, 1500–1800;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"O’Rourke, Kevin Hjortshøj; Williamson, Jeffrey G.";"Some world historians attach globalisation ‘big bang’ significance to 1492 and 1498. Such scholars are on the side of Adam Smith who believed that these were the two most important events in recorded history. Other world historians insist that globalisation stretches back even earlier. There is a third view which argues that the world economy was fragmented and completely de-globalised before the early nineteenth century. None of these three competing views has distinguished explicitly between trade expansion driven by booming import demand or export supply, and trade expansion driven by the integration of markets between trading economies. This article makes that distinction, and shows that there is no evidence supporting the view that the world economy was globally integrated prior to the 1490s; there is also no evidence supporting the view that this decade had the trading impact that world historians assign to it; but there is abundant evidence supporting the view that a very big globalisation bang took place in the 1820s.

Officer, Lawrence H.;A new monetary base series is presented for the United States from 1789 to 1932, when the country was on an actual or potential specie standard. The series builds on the Friedman–Schwartz monetary base series and extends it back in time. Monetary balance of payments series are generated, consistent with the monetary base. The time span 1792–1932 is divided into subperiods primarily based on the identification of a monetary authority, also including the greenback period and classic gold standard. Results for the monetary base, exchange market pressure, and economic performance are presented on that basis. The classic gold standard (1879–1913) is undeniably superior to all other periods.;2002;The U.S. Specie Standard, 1792–1932: Some Monetarist Arithmetic;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Olmstead, Alan L.; Rhode, Paul W.";Standard treatments of U.S. agriculture assert that, before the 1930s, productivity growth was almost exclusively the result of mechanization rather than biological innovations. This article shows that U.S. wheat production witnessed wholesale changes in varieties and cultural practices during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Without these changes, vast expanses of the wheat belt could not have sustained commercial production and yields everywhere would have plummeted due to the increasing severity of insects, diseases, and weeds. Revised estimates of Parker and Klein’s productivity calculations indicate that biological innovations contributed roughly half of labor-productivity growth between 1839 and 1909.;2002;The Red Queen and the Hard Reds: Productivity Growth in American Wheat, 1800–1940;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Pinilla, Vicente; Ayuda, María Isabel";At the end of the nineteenth century some of the less developed countries of Southern Europe often faced major problems when they sought to increase their exports of primary products. Such problems were a consequence of the tariff policies implemented by a number of their trading partners. In this article we analyse the case of the Spanish exports of ordinary table wine during the period 1890–1935. The expansion of wine production outside Europe meant that some countries in the American continent raised their tariffs to protect national production, which caused serious damage to exporters. Much more serious was the discriminatory trade policy initiated by France in 1891 which gave priority to the tariff-free importing of Algerian wine, as against the high tariffs that had to be paid by other exporters. This policy, as well as protecting French production, aimed to support her colonial policy in Algeria and seriously affected Spanish exports, as shown by our data and the econometric analysis we have carried out. The Spanish response resulted in a greater penetration of other European markets, thanks to the competitiveness of Spanish wine, but this did not prevent a serious crisis in the sector.;2002;The political economy of the wine trade: Spanish exports and the international market, 1890-1935;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Pomfret, R.;When Soviet central planners began to mechanize the cotton harvest in earnest in 1958, they expected more rapid diffusion than the market-driven process that had begun in the United States a decade earlier. But despite high output of cotton-picking machines, the share of the crop harvested mechanically grew more slowly than in the United States. The factor proportions in Central Asia did not justify mechanization: although planners could enforce introduction of the new technology, investment in cotton-harvesting machines was largely a waste of resources.

In Dijon, where the Estates of Burgundy’s debt amounted to nearly half of all bonds in that small market, there was limited need for intermediaries. In the 1740s the borrowing needs of the province expanded, and the estates began to borrow in Paris, where their debt remained a small fraction of the market, and where they relied on notaries to place their bonds and to create a secondary market.

These pressures led to a considerable increase in the proportion of new investment devoted to corporate securities, including ordinary shares.

Sutherland, D.;This article investigates the distributional impact of the abolition of “feudalism” during the French Revolution. Landlords ostensibly benefitted from laws permitting them to raise rents by the equivalent of the former tithe. Increasingly, however, the state appropriated this windfall by raising land taxes. Tenants ultimately shouldered a double burden of higher rents and heavier taxes, and they often responded with acts of evasion. But the new financial pressures on tenants and landlords were often offset—and occasionally overbalanced—by substantial productivity gains, which cushioned their disposable incomes in the face of these new obligations.;2002;PEASANTS, LORDS, AND LEVIATHAN: WINNERS AND LOSERS FROM THE ABOLITION OF FRENCH FEUDALISM, 1780–1820.;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Suzuki, Masao;This article examines the determinants of Japanese immigrant economic achievement in the continental United States before World War II. Japanese immigrants to the United States were a select group in terms of their occupational background and education relative to the Japanese population as a whole because of the restrictions imposed on Japanese immigration by both the Japanese and U.S. governments. Furthermore, the selective nature of Japanese immigration contributed to the economic achievement of Japanese Americans before World War II, when their occupational position underwent a dramatic improvement.

Temin, Peter;I reconsider the growth of Western Europe during the Golden Age of European Economic Growth after the Second World War. The preceding thirty years of conflict and depression impeded the normal path of industrialisation in these countries, and they had too much labour in agriculture for their level of income and stage of development at the end of the war. The disequilibrium added to other more ordinary forces to produce unusually rapid economic growth.

Thomasson, Melissa A.;This paper explores the institutional development of health insurance in the United States. By combining a qualitative history of the development of the market with an empirical analysis of a panel of health insurance data from 1931–1955, the paper identifies a number of factors that influenced the growth of the health insurance market. While demand factors such as increasing income and improvements in medical technology certainly contributed to the growth of the market, supply side factors were also important. There is evidence that hospitals may have contributed to the growth of health insurance as a means of smoothing revenues during the Great Depression. State-level policies that allowed the Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans to operate as nonprofits also spurred market growth, as did federal government policies that promoted the link between employment and health insurance.;2002;From Sickness to Health: The Twentieth-Century Development of U.S. Health Insurance;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

A'Hearn, Brian;New estimates of mean stature indicate declining heights in Northern Italy from 1730 to 1860, corroborating recent findings of a deterioration in per capita GDP and real wages—though possibly calling into question its severity. The level of heights in the 1830s is respectable in international comparison. Estimated geographic and occupational effects show the influence of the disease environment, malnutrition, and income. Declining living standards suggest a Malthusian interpretation of the economy, in which even a relatively flexible agricultural sector was not quite able to keep up with the growing pressure of population on resources.John Komlos arranged the collection of the data analyzed here and made them available to me.

"Alexopoulos, M.; Cohen, J.";There is a general consensus among scholars that centralised wage bargaining played a key role in the ability of Sweden to maintain wage moderation in the early post-World War II period. Conventional wisdom suggests that it worked through one of two mechanisms: internalisation of the negative externalities associated with excessive wage settlements or implicit contracts that favoured cooperation between capital and labour over conflict. We contend, instead, that centralised wage bargaining was introduced because Swedish firms and unions adopted the Rehn-Meidner plan. In this environment, centralised wage bargaining was used to facilitate wage compression from below and promote labour release. Wage moderation then was a result of shifts in the labour supply. In the final section of the article we argue that excessive wage compression in the 1970s sapped the morale and effort of skilled workers, pushed down productivity and profits and eventually led to the demise of centralised wage determination.;2003;Centralised wage bargaining and structural change in Sweden;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The model explores the impact of population, enclosure, empire, representative government, technology, and literacy on urbanization, agricultural productivity, proto-industry, and the real wage. Simulations show that the main factors leading to economic success in north-western Europe were the growth of American and Asian commerce and, especially, the innovations underlying the export of the new draperies in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The enclosure of the open fields, representative government, and the spread of literacy did not play major roles.;2003;Progress and poverty in early modern Europe;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

We use the dual technique and argue that the estimates we derive from factor prices are of similar quality to quantity-based calculations. Our results provide further evidence, calculated on the basis of an independent set of sources, that productivity growth during the British Industrial Revolution was relatively slow. The Crafts–Harley view of the Industrial Revolution is thus reinforced. Our preferred estimates suggest a modest acceleration after 1800.;2003;Factor prices and productivity growth during the British industrial revolution;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Holding labor and capital inputs constant and controlling for days of operation per month and months per year, this elasticity was positive but less than one, indicating diminishing returns. We also find diminishing returns to days per month and months per year, but these elasticities were significantly larger. Thus, decreases in daily hours coupled with an offsetting rise in annual days of operation would increase productive efficiency—precisely the kinds of changes then actually taking place.;2003;Productivity in manufacturing and the length of the working day: evidence from the 1880 census of manufactures;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Baker, Mae; Collins, Michael";The article examines the behaviour of two leading English clearing banks, the Midland and Westminster, during periods of financial distress suffered by a sample of business clients during the early postwar decades. Such periods provide valuable insight into the nature of bank—business relationships at that time for, in a sense, bank reaction during periods of financial difficulty for client firms helps define the limits to bank support and commitment to such firms. The article examines the banks' behaviour within the context of a transaction bank model (as opposed to what might be termed a relationship bank model) and the results are compared with those of an earlier study by the authors of pre-First World War bank practice. The results show that the banks did operate many of the control mechanisms associated with transaction banking and that the proficiency of such controls ensured that the banks' interests remained reasonably secure even for the high risk loans under study. Importantly, however, the evidence also shows that the banks did not exercise a stark choice between, on the one hand, supporting clients while relying upon traditional control mechanisms, and, on the other, withdrawing support. In a significant number of cases, the banks were prepared to invest in gathering more information on a client's business, and in trying to influence the direction of that business. This suggests a more informed and interventionist approach by the banks in these cases compared to the findings in the pre-1914 study. For the sample of cases examined, it seems that while much of the behaviour of the two banks remained consistent with the transaction bank model, compared to our pre-1914 findings there was also a greater tendency towards a more flexible, ‘hands-on’ approach in extremis. In these cases, English bank behaviour was similar in some respects to that of the more interventionist European banks, and less like that predicted by the transaction bank model.;2003;English commercial banks and business client distress, 1946-63;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Bateman, Fred; Taylor, Jason E.";While a multitude of New Deal “relief, recovery, and reform” agencies were created in response to the 1930s economic shock, many of these same agencies were subsumed by the Federal Works Agency and played key national defense roles during the 1940s. We examine the wartime expenditure patterns of these agencies, as well as spending on war supply contracts and war-related industrial facilities, to determine whether Depression-era economic goals were addressed during the Second World War. We find that some specific aspects of the New Deal economic agenda were carried out during the war. Furthermore, wartime spending by the alphabet agencies was significantly correlated with the expenditure patterns of those agencies during the 1930s, suggesting that the transition from economic to military objectives may not have been as pointed as the Roosevelt Administration often asserted.;2003;The New Deal at war: alphabet agencies’ expenditure patterns, 1940–1945;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Baten, Jörg;A rapidly growing literature in industrial economics and regional economics uses data sets of individual firms or regional firm creation rates to answer the central question: what makes entrepreneurs? Which factors encourage some people to set up their own business and create jobs, and what prevents potential entrepreneurs from doing so? This contribution explores the determinants of regional differences in firm creation rates by using a new data set of 4,036 individual firms from Southwest Germany around 1900. Agglomeration effects and earlier firm creations stimulate current firm creation. In addition, a small and medium firm environment allows the formation of specific human capital — another favourable factor for a dynamic firm creation process in some regions.;2003;Creating firms for a new century: Determinants of firm creation around 1900;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Bekar, Cliff T.; Reed, Clyde G.";Why were open fields pervasive in the middle ages? Our findings support the general contention that behavior towards risk explains the persistence of open fields, but we reject the mechanism of diversification via scattered landholdings. Simulation analysis is used to estimate the relative efficiency of alternative forms of insurance available to peasant households. We find that, for the vast majority of peasants, self-insurance through land accumulation was a superior risk management/wealth accumulation strategy, but only if land could be transacted in small parcels. Scattering existed because it transformed land into a divisible savings instrument.;2003;Open fields, risk, and land divisibility;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Bessen, James;"In 1842 Lowell textile firms increased weaving productivity by assigning three looms per worker instead of two. This marked a turning point. Before, weavers at Lowell were temporary and mostly literate Yankee farm girls; afterwards, firms increasingly hired local residents, including illiterate and Irish workers. An important factor was on-the-job learning. Literate workers learned new technology faster, but local workers stayed longer. These changes were unprofitable before 1842, and the advantages of literacy declined over time. Firm policy and social institutions slowly changed to permit deeper human-capital investment and more productive implementation of technology.";2003;Technology and Learning by Factory Workers: The Stretch-Out at Lowell, 1842;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Blum, U.; Dudley, Leonard";Traditional explanations for Western Europe's demographic growth in the High Middle Ages are unable to explain the rise in per capita income that accompanied observed population changes. Here, we examine the hypothesis that an innovation in information technology changed the optimal structure of contracts and raised the productivity of human capital. We present historical evidence for this thesis, offer a theoretical explanation based on transaction costs, and test the theory's predictions with data on urban demographic growth. We find that the information-technology hypothesis significantly increases the capacity of the neoclassical growth model to explain European economic expansion between 1000 and 1300.;2003;Standardised Latin and medieval economic growth;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

We construct an annual index of UK financial conditions for 1790–1999 and use a dynamic probit model to estimate the effect of shocks on the index. We find evidence that price level shocks contributed significantly to financial instability during 1820–1931 and that inflation rate shocks contributed to instability during 1931–1999. While affecting the stability of the financial system, both the nature of aggregate price shocks and their impact depend on the existing monetary and financial regime.;2003;Aggregate price shocks and financial stability: the United Kingdom 1796–1999;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Brunt, Liam;Variations in levels of embodied technology generated variations in English plough prices in 1770. Using plough prices as a quality index, this article explains size and daily output of plough teams. It shows that variations in plough technology were due to technological change?not static optimization?and village plough technology was influenced by neighbouring villages. But technological advance was not constrained on the demand size: farmers purchased the best ploughs available. Rather, local supply of technology was the limiting factor. Technological change, urbanization, and information networks are rejected as explanations of local supply of technology. The key factor was market density.;2003;Mechanical innovation in the industrial revolution: the case of plough design;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Brunt, Liam;Summary Young was the most prolific and quantitative agricultural writer in England in the eighteenth century. Generally highly regarded by his contemporaries, his reputation among British agricultural historians is at an all-time low. This article charts and explains Young's fall from grace. It rebuts the criticisms made of his methods and writings, and shows that Young is a well-informed, accurate, reliable, and reasonable historical source. It demonstrates that the Farmer's tour is based on a broadly representative sample of English farms during the industrial revolution and argues that modern techniques of data analysis can overcome any errors or biases in Young's data.;2003;Rehabilitating Arthur Young;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Caruana, Leonard; Rockoff, Hugh";During World War II the United States attempted to prevent Germany from acquiring wolfram (tungsten ore) in Spain by buying it in the open market. Preemptive buying forced the Germans to pay more for and to consume less tungsten, a material crucial for the production of machine tools and armor-piercing shells. The income provided an important incentive for Spain to remain neutral. The naval blockade and the relatively low elasticity of the supply of wolfram contributed to the success of the wolfram-buying campaign.;2003;A Wolfram in Sheep's Clothing: Economic Warfare in Spain, 1940–1944;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The contribution of his policy measures however remains to be rigorously measured, with proper control of other forces also driving the recovery. Structural vector autoregression analysis of previously unexploited monthly data confirms the pivotal role of Takahashi's debt-financed fiscal expansion. Monetizing the public debts, the Bank of Japan maintained a neutral stance.

"Chenny, Shirley; St-Amour, Pascal; Vencatachellum, Désiré";We construct a unique data set from succession and bankruptcy sales in Mauritius to investigate the determinants of slave prices between 1825 and 1827. We find that males, females sold with children, skilled slaves and slaves sold during the peak sugar cane harvest season all fetched higher prices. In comparison, handicapped and non-native slaves were sold at a discount. Moreover, the young child premium increased over the period. This may indicate that slave owners did not anticipate that slavery would be abolished in the near future or thought that they would be compensated in such an event.;2003;Slave prices from succession and bankruptcy sales in Mauritius, 1825–1827;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Collins, William J.;This paper explores the political economy of anti-discrimination legislation during the ascendancy of the Civil Rights Movement. It traces the diffusion of state-level fair employment laws and evaluates the relative importance of various demographic, political, and economic factors in promoting such legislation. Activism by Jewish organizations, the NAACP, and unions (particularly the CIO) were key factors in securing the adoption of fair employment legislation. Less unemployment, a larger Catholic population, more competitive political systems, and Democratic governorships appear to have been less important. Predicted times for the adoption of fair employment laws by the southern states underscore the necessity of federal intervention to establish legal protection from job market discrimination.;2003;The political economy of state-level fair employment laws, 1940–1964;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Dribe, M.;Preindustrial society was characterised by vast uncertainties due to harvest failures and fluctuations in prices of basic commodities. These economic fluctuations had severe effects on the standard of living, especially for the poorer segments of the population, as shown for instance, by the increased mortality following economic crises. This article examines the extent to which migration could be used as a measure to deal with economic stress by sending individual family members away, or relocating the entire family. A micro-level approach is taken, where a longitudinal dataset at the individual level is used in the analysis of a rural community in southern Sweden for the period 1829–1866. The results show that landless people did not move in response to economic stress, most likely because of the lack of available alternatives and prohibitively high costs of long-range migration. Thus, migration does not appear to have been an effective way of dealing with economic stress in this preindustrial rural community.;2003;Dealing with economic stress through migration: Lessons from nineteenth century rural Sweden;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

After explaining the distribution dynamics approach, the empirical analysis examines both the observed period dynamics and the unique long-run equilibrium associated with three periods. This study suggests persistence and stratification, not convergence, characterized the pre-1914 regime, whereas convergence was the key feature of the post-war regime. However, a larger sample of OECD economies in the post-war period indicates that convergence was primarily a feature of the Golden Age and in the post-Golden Age period separation, polarization, and divergence came to the fore.;2003;Distribution dynamics: stratification, polarization, and convergence among OECD economies, 1870–1992;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Esteves, Rui Pedro;The history of public finances in Portugal from the middle of the nineteenth century to World War I is distinguished by the pursuit of an ambitious programme of public investment in infrastructure, and by the negative financial consequences this elicited, culminating in the 1892 default. In this article we approach the Portuguese financial history of this period with a relatively new methodology for evaluating financial sustainability, which emphasises the inter-temporal nature of government budgeting. The results obtained allow us to quantify the distance that separated Portuguese finances from a sustainable path throughout the period. Although the generational imbalance of Portuguese finances at the time seems massive in the context of today's benchmarks, its economic and financial impact should have been more limited, given the government's relatively low weight in the economy and the favourable demographic pattern.;2003;Looking ahead from the past: The inter-temporal sustainability of Portuguese finances, 1854-1910;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Falch, T.; Tovmo, P.";The evolution of the welfare state in the twentieth century has changed local public finance considerably. This article investigates determinants of local public spending in Norway since the 1930s with an emphasis on the fiscal year 1934–35. We document huge variation in local government spending in 1934–35. The disparities initiated several reforms in the 1930s with the aim of reducing the inequality. The changes in regional policy over time are illustrated by correlation coefficients between municipal spending and private income. The correlation is strongly positive in 1934–35, but is reduced over time, and has been negative since the 1970s. We find that the variation in spending between local governments is reduced over time mainly for two reasons. First, while the elasticity of municipal spending with respect to private income is fairly constant over time, the variation in private income has become smaller. Second, grants from the central government have become a larger part of the local governments' budgets and are to an increasing degree used for redistributional purposes.;2003;Norwegian local public finance in the 1930s and beyond;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
FENOALTEA, STEFANO;This article reconsiders industrial growth in post-Unification Italy in light of a new set of sector-specific production estimates. Though still in part provisional, the new series confirm that the production of durables (and related materials) was dominated by the Kuznets cycle. A similar cycle is documented in the growth rate of the residual, excluding foodstuffs, and extended by reasonable assumption to foodstuffs as well. The new series thus support the traditional view of the 1880s as a period of widespread prosperity and above-trend consumption rather than the opposite, now dominant view.This article presents the first comprehensive results of a long-term research project that owes much to the constant encouragement of Pierluigi Ciocca and Gianni Toniolo, to extended exchanges with Giovanni Federico, to the kindness of the librarians at the Bank of Italy and the Istituto centrale di statistica, and not least, for their financial support, to the Ente per gli studi monetari, bancari e finanziari “Luigi Einaudi,” the National Science Foundation, the Guggenheim Foundation, and the Ministero dell'Università e della Ricerca Scientifica e Tecnologica.

The concomitant change in the industrial rankings argues against attributing the regions' different paths to their different initial conditions; surprisingly, too, overall growth does not seem closely tied to industrial development.

FERDERER, J. PETER;With passage of the Federal Reserve Act in 1913, the institutional structure necessary to support an American market for bankers' acceptances was created. This article examines the development of the secondary market for bankers' acceptances during its first 20 years. It provides evidence that discount market liquidity increased dramatically during the 1920s and helped the dollar acceptance challenge the sterling bill as an important source of trade finance around the world. The Federal Reserve Banks played a key role by reducing the risk borne by private dealers and propelling the market to a high-liquidity equilibrium.The author thanks Mike Haupert, William Roberds, and Ellis Tallman for their useful comments and suggestions, and Susan Isaac for her excellent editorial assistance.

This article presents preliminary results drawn from a computer-based reconstruction of the copyhold land market, 1546-1750, to contest Macfarlane's reading of the family-land bond in the manor. The familial possession of land over long periods is shown to be normal, and consistent with an active land market predominantly in smaller parcels. Little consolidation took place in the manor although some growth in holding size was achieved through subtenancy.

Grant, Oliver;The decline of German emigration to the United States after 1895 was precipitate to a degree not matched by other “old immigration” sources. The paper considers possible reasons for this: the effect of land availability, relative growth rates of the US and German economies, and the impact of the so-called “new immigration” from southern and eastern Europe. It concludes that German immigration was unusually affected by competition from newer migrant sources, due to skill similarities and similar patterns of settlement. However, the more rapid growth of the German economy after 1895 and the movement of the land frontier into areas less suited to German agricultural skills also played a part. It shows that the skills possessed by migrants were an important factor in migrant earnings. The arrival in the US of large numbers of immigrants with similar skill endowments and lower reservation wages made emigration to the United States a less attractive option for potential German migrants after 1895.;2003;Globalisation versus de-coupling: German emigration and the evolution of the Atlantic labour market 1870–1913;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Grove, Wayne A.; Heinicke, Craig";Following World War II millions of cotton workers, especially African-Americans, left the fields forever, and farmers mechanized the cotton harvest. Prevailing empirical studies argue that high factory wages lured farmhands away. Based on newly reconstructed data, we estimate the causes of the demise of harvest employment in 12 major cotton-producing states from 1949–1964 and find important roles for mechanization, government farm programs, higher nonagricultural wages, and falling cotton prices. On net, our estimates indicate that factors affecting farm labor demand, not labor-supply influences, caused the disappearance of hand-picked cotton—results that reverse the best econometric work to date.For helpful comments, we thank Lee Alston, Larry Neal, Werner Baer, Bill Collins, Lee Craig, Carl Moody, Beverley Peart, Eric Hilt, Michele Knapp, the participants of the workshops at Syracuse University, Northwestern University, the University of Illinois, Colby College, Harvard University, the All-Ohio Economic History Seminar (Ohio State University Economics Department), the Social Science History Association Meeting (2001), and the Allied Social Science Meeting (2002), anonymous referees and the editor, Gavin Wright.

"Gustafsson, B.; Johansson, M.";This article aims to throw light on why inequality in the distribution of income in Sweden fell from the mid-1920s to the second half of the 1950s. A new database has been created by coding tax records and other documents for the city of Göteborg. In the analysis the Gini-coefficient and its changes are decomposed by income source. The information shows that in the mid-1920s income in urban Sweden was fairly unequally distributed. The compression of the income distribution came about as real income at the lower end increased rapidly, while the real income of the most affluent decile remained more or less constant. Much of the initial decrease in income inequality was due to capital income decreasing in average size and in addition becoming less extremely concentrated at the top of the income distribution. From the mid-1930s onward households paid ever larger shares of their income as income taxes which caused income inequality to decrease.;2003;Steps toward equality: How and why income inequality in urban Sweden changed during the period 1925-1958;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

When an industry has specific technological features that limit a government's ability to expropriate it, or when the industry is able to call on foreign governments to enforce its de facto property rights, economic agents can easily mitigate changes in formal institutions designed to reduce these property rights. We explore the Mexican oil industry from 1911 to 1929 and demonstrate that informal rather than formal institutions were key, permitting oil companies to coordinate their responses to increases in taxes or the redefinition of their de jure property rights.;2003;When the Law Does Not Matter: The Rise and Decline of the Mexican Oil Industry;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
HADEISHI, HAJIME;This study investigates the relationship between income and fertility in Nuits-Saint-Georges, a small Burgundian town. Nuits offers a rich location to study fertility because of its broad range of occupations, income, and literacy. I constructed a data set that linked fertility through 1792 for couples married between 1744 and 1779 with fiscal records tracking the families' tax payments. Controlling for occupation and literacy, my principle findings were that wealthier families had more births, changes in fertility were positively correlated with increases in income over the life cycle, and marital fertility in Nuits steadily declined over the latter eighteenth century.The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not represent the views of the Federal Trade Commission or any individual Commissioner.

"Haines, Michael R.; Craig, Lee A.; WEISS, THOMAS";Between 1830 and 1860 the United States experienced rapid economic growth but declining stature and rising mortality. Debate has centered on whether the American diet deteriorated in the mid-nineteenth century. Employing census and muster records, this article tests the hypotheses that adult height was positively correlated with local production of nutrients in early childhood and negatively correlated with local mortality conditions, urbanization, proximity to transport, and population mobility. Results indicate that antebellum economic growth was accompanied by an increasing nationalization and internationalization of the disease environment, which affected the health and longevity of the population.This article is based on two earlier papers presented at the conference “The Biological Standard of Living and Economic Development: Nutrition, Health, and Well-Being in Historical Perspective,” held at the University of Munich, Munich, Germany, 18–21 January 1997.

"Hickson, Charles R.; Turner, John D.";The 1826 Banking Copartnership Act allowed unlimited liability joint stock banks to form freely for the first time. Such banks were criticised by Walter Bagehot because he believed that impecunious individuals would own their shares. As the 1826 Act crucially contained a post-sale-extended liability restriction, Bagehot's view reduces to whether or not this restriction was effective. This article tests the effectiveness of this restriction by using a simple finance model to measure the risk of the shares of limited and unlimited banks, which traded concurrently during our sample period. Using share price data from 1873 to 1888, obtained from the Investor's Monthly Manual, our results indicate that the perceived risk of the unlimited liability banks was greater, and after the general move to limited liability in 1879, perceived risk fell. Furthermore, we also find that, after controlling for size, the unlimited liability banks tended to have a smaller number of shareholders and stickier share prices.;2003;Shareholder liability regimes in nineteenth-century English banking: The impact upon the market for shares;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Another hypothesis is that the governing bodies of these banks, constrained by special legal restrictions on share trading, acted effectively to prevent such shares being transferred to the less wealthy.

"Huberman, Michael; Lewchuk, Wayne A.";Globalisation was a fact of life in Europe before 1913, but as trade shares increased, so did wage and employment instability. Faced by growing pressure from workers, national authorities established labour compacts — a packet of labour market regulations and social insurance programmes — that defended workers against the risks they faced in and outside the factory. The labour compact provided workers with insurance because it compressed wage structures. We construct an index of labour market regulations and social insurance schemes for seventeen European countries and find that the extent of the labour compact varied with the level of openness. We conclude that the labour compact gave workers reason to support free trade because it protected them from external risk. Contrary to the received view, globalisation before 1913 was compatible with state intervention.

Huff, W. G.;Using new statistics, this article analyses financial development in Southeast Asia over the seven decades 1870?1939. The region experienced substantial, and in some instances rapid, vent-for-surplus economic growth based on a narrow range of primary commodities. But in 1939 all Southeast Asian countries still had relatively undeveloped financial infrastructures dominated by metropolitan interests, considerably reliant on informal finance, and geared towards primary commodity exports. The article suggests that a lack of opportunities and a variety of country-specific considerations were more important explanations than weak financial development for an absence of greater industrialization and agricultural modernization in Southeast Asia.;2003;Monetization and financial development in Southeast Asia before the Second World War;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

KAPLANIS, COSTAS;The debasement of the Byzantine gold coin during the reign of Constantine IX Monomachus (1042–1055) marked the end of more than seven centuries of near stability and the beginning of a sharp fall in the coin's gold content.

Komlos, John;The height of the French male population of the Ancien Régime is estimated, on the basis of military records, to have been about 162 cm in the seventeenth century. This extremely short stature implies that ‘the crisis of the 17th century’ had an immense impact on the human organism itself. The improvement in climatic conditions at the turn of the eighteenth century had an ameliorating effect on the human organism, increasing its size by nearly 4 cms within a span of 12 years. Improved weather had a beneficial impact on agricultural conditions as well as a direct effect on biological processes. The physical stature of men increased until the birth cohorts of the 1740s, to decline thereafter, in keeping with the European pattern, although the decline of the second half of the eighteenth century was not more severe than elsewhere in Europe. France was not suffering from a prolonged period of malnutrition of unusual severity, and the threat of a Malthusian crisis was mild compared to seventeenth-century conditions. Hence, the anthropometric evidence supports the notion that the French economic malaise was not a fundamental cause of the political turmoil. To be sure, there were very large social differences in the biological standard of living, which clearly fuelled the fires of revolution. The height of the French upper classes was 7 cm above average, but that, too, was standard for contemporary Europe.;2003;An anthropometric history of early-modern France;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
KURAN, TIMUR;During the second millennium, the Middle East's commerce with Western Europe fell increasingly under European domination. Two factors played critical roles. First, the Islamic inheritance system, by raising the costs of dissolving a partnership following a partner's death, kept Middle Eastern commercial enterprises small and ephemeral. Second, certain European inheritance systems facilitated large and durable partnerships by reducing the likelihood of premature dissolution. The upshot is that European enterprises grew larger than those of the Islamic world. Moreover, while ever larger enterprises propelled further organizational transformations in Europe, persistently small enterprises inhibited economic modernization in the Middle East.For useful comments on previous drafts, I am indebted to Scott Altman, Murat Çizakça, Avner Greif, Eric Jones, Daniel Klerman, Naomi Lamoreaux, ôevket Pamuk, David Powers, Kenneth Sokoloff, Jan de Vries, Dean Williamson, and three anonymous referees.

Lains, Pedro;This paper analyses the causes of Portuguese catching-up to the European core, in the 20th century, within a growth accounting framework. It concludes that investment in human and physical capital was the main driving force of economic growth and that variation in output growth rates are attributable to changes in total factor productivity growth. The paper explains the decline in TFP growth after 1973 in terms of structural change in the industrial sector.;2003;Catching up to the European core: Portuguese economic growth, 1910–1990;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Lains, Pedro;Recent studies of European agricultural history have shown that, during the early phases of economic development, agricultural growth can occur in the absence of major institutional changes. This article extends such a conclusion — of agricultural growth without major institutional change — to the case of Portugal during the period from 1850 to 1950. Based on new indices for agricultural output growth and data on the use of inputs, we show in this article that Portuguese agriculture was not stagnant in that century and that output and labour productivity expanded rapidly, in particular in the decades from 1870–1900 and 1930–50 We propose an explanation for the positive performance of the agricultural sector which is related to the changing patterns in the use of land and in the product mix, and to the growth of domestic demand for agricultural produce.;2003;New wine in old bottles: Output and productivity trends in Portuguese agriculture, 1850-1950;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
LAW, MARC T.;Why did state governments begin to regulate the food industry in the late nineteenth century? One possible explanation is that pure food regulation was the result of rent seeking on the part of traditional food producers who wanted to limit the availability of new substitutes. Another potential hypothesis is that regulation was desired because it helped solve an asymmetric information problem in the market for food products. I find the evidence to be more consistent with the latter hypothesis.;2003;The Origins of State Pure Food Regulation;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Lee, John S.;Summary Von Thünen's model of the relationship between concentrated urban demand and rural land use proposes that towns will draw agricultural produce from a series of zones of specialized production around the urban centre. Using the accounts of King's Hall and King's College, this article identifies the areas that supplied Cambridge with food and fuel during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and the persistence of such trade. Local geographical conditions meant that, contrary to von Thünen's model, firewood and charcoal were brought from more distant regions than those supplying wheat and malt barley, and Cambridge's hinterland also had to compete with demand from London.;2003;Feeding the colleges: Cambridge's food and fuel supplies, 1450–1560;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Lindert, Peter H.;The debate over whether political democracy is the least bad regime, as Churchill said, remains unresolved because history has been misread, and because statistical studies have chosen the wrong tests. This address reinterprets five key experiences to show how the institutional channels linking voice and growth are evolving with the economy. Until the early nineteenth century, the key institutional link was property-rights and contract enforcement. Since then, the human-investment channel has assumed an ever-greater role. Elite rule damages growth by underinvesting in egalitarian human capital, especially primary schooling, relative to historical norms for successful economies.This Presidential Address was delivered at the Economic History Association Annual Meeting, 12 October 2002, in St. Louis, Missouri.;2003;Voice and Growth: Was Churchill Right?;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"MacLeod, Christine; Tann, Jennifer; Andrew, James; Stein, Jeremy";It has long been recognized that counting patents offers a poor gauge of the extent and value of inventive activity, not least because the quality of patented inventions varies enormously. The Schankerman-Pakes model provides a valuable alternative gauge that utilizes the data from renewal fees which are regularly paid to keep a patent in force. This article suggests, however, that the model's application to nineteenth-century UK patents may underestimate the value of Victorian inventive activity because many patentees lacked the financial resources to implement the rational choice that the model assumes. Focusing on steam-engineering patents, it explores further problems with renewal data and the increasing rate of lapsed applications.;2003;Evaluating inventive activity: the cost of nineteenth-century UK patents and the fallibility of renewal data;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Mason, Joseph R.;This paper analyzes the role of political rent-seeking in New Deal expenditures focusing on the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC). Unlike other New Deal agencies, the RFC was not financed by government appropriations, it devolved assistance decisions, and primarily offered loans rather than grants.

MORIGUCHI, CHIAKI;This article combines a game-theoretic framework and a comparative analysis to study the impact of the Great Depression on private welfare capitalism. Recharacterizing welfare capitalism as an implicit-contract equilibrium, the article documents parallel institutional developments in the United States and Japan in the 1920s and the process of bifurcation thereafter. In the United States, the breach of contract by major employers induced by the depression led to the rise of explicit contracts and legal enforcement institutions. By contrast, the less severe depression in Japan allowed the maintenance of implicit contracts and the formation of complementary labor laws.This article is partly based on my doctoral dissertation.

"Ó Gráda, Cormac; White, Eugene Nelson";Using records of individual depositors' accounts, this article provides a detailed microeconomic analysis of two banking panics. The panics of 1854 and 1857 were not characterized by an immediate mass panic of depositors and had important time dimensions. We examine depositor behavior using a hazard model. Contagion was the key factor in 1854 but it created only a local panic. The 1857 panic began with runs by businessmen and banking sophisticates followed by less informed depositors. Evidence suggests that this panic was driven by informational shocks in the face of asymmetric information about the true condition of bank portfolios.;2003;The Panics of 1854 and 1857: A View from the Emigrant Industrial Savings Bank;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Olmstead, Alan L.; Rhode, Paul W.";Between 1928 and 1960 U.S. cotton production experienced a revolution with average yields roughly tripling while the quality of the crop increased significantly.

The story displays two phenomena germane to the recent literature: an important real-world example of Akerlof's lemons model and a case in which inventors, during an early phase of the product cycle, encouraged consumers to copy and disseminate their intellectual property.We would like to thank Shelby Baker, Dick Bassett, Fred Bourland, J.

These offer rich descriptions of individuals, including a pockmarked complexion. While pockmarks were not clearly associated with stunting in Ireland or in most of England, the connection did exist in London.

Rosés, Joan Ramón;Spain provides an opportunity to study the causes of regional differences in industrial development over the nineteenth century. As transportation costs decreased and barriers to domestic trade were eliminated, Spanish manufacturing became increasingly concentrated in a few regions. This article combines Heckscher-Ohlin and economic-geography frameworks and finds that comparative-advantage and increasing-return effects were economically very significant and practically explained all differences in industrialization levels across regions. The deficits of some regions in terms of industrialization appear to have been largely attributable to their factor endowments and the absence of home-market effects for modern industries.;2003;Why Isn't the Whole of Spain Industrialized?

Leverage had a negative effect on maintenance, within small firms only. Bankruptcy had a positive effect on maintenance and employment, within large firms only. Both leverage and bankruptcy effects were significantly larger during the worst depression years. Had all railroads been bankrupt during 1930–1933, GDP would have increased by 0.2 percent annually, and employment by 0.125 percent annually.

Selgin, George;This article challenges the claim that Great Britain solved its ?big problem of small change? (the problem of keeping decent low-denomination coins in circulation) by embracing Matthew Boulton's steam-based coining technology. Evidence from Great Britain's commercial token episode (1787?97) shows that a successful small change system depended, not on the motive power employed in coining, but on the quality and consistency of coin engravings and on having means for systematically withdrawing worn coins. The Tower Mint failed to solve Great Britain's small change problem, not because its equipment was old-fashioned, but because its policies and constitution were flawed.;2003;Steam, hot air, and small change: Matthew Boulton and the reform of Britain's coinage;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Tattara, Giuseppe;For most of the classical gold standard era, Italy was not formally committed to gold, instead the lira “shadowed” gold. The remarkable stability of the lira exchange rate raises the question of why Italy did not move to official convertibility when it could have gained gold standard benefits at a seemingly low cost. The answer to this puzzle lies in the management of the Italy’s large foreign debt. Although denominated in lire, holders of the debt had the privilege of converting their coupons into gold at the official exchange rate in Paris. This arrangement offered the government an opportunity to temporarily exploit domestic bondholders who found it difficult to circumvent the barriers to arbitrage. In times of fiscal problems, the government gained some seignorage while the lira was allowed a limited depreciation. Shadowing the official gold rate, lost some of the possible benefits of convertibility but gave the government fiscal flexibility.;2003;Paper money but a gold debt: Italy on the gold standard;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Thompson, Andrew S.; MAGEE, GARY B.";The belief that Britain's empire markets were soft is well entrenched in the literature. It is, however, a belief that has been largely untested. Indeed, the literature does not even offer an explicit definition of softness. This article attempts to fill this gap by discussing the meaning of the term and then posing the question whether between 1870 and 1914 Britain's fastest growing markets?Australasia and Canada?can in fact reasonably be labelled soft, as has often been assumed. The article concludes that the demand for British imports in these markets was driven more by considerations of income and price than by colonial sentiment or preference.;2003;A soft touch?

Variables such as the spread of the telegraph, trade volumes, and the diffusion of the ‘single currency’ fail to explain why it took 25 years for prices across regional stock exchanges to converge.

A detailed reconstruction of GDP and purchasing power parities shows that before the Industrial Revolution Java’s GDP per capita was about a third of the level of the Netherlands, confirming Angus Maddison’s estimates. Disparities in real wages were much smaller, however, for skilled laborers real wages on Java were higher than in the Netherlands. This paradox arises because the structure of the economy and the distribution of income of both countries was very different.;2003;Rich and poor before the Industrial Revolution: a comparison between Java and the Netherlands at the beginning of the 19th century;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Voth, Hans-Joachim;In May 1927, the German central bank intervened indirectly to reduce lending to equity investors. The crash that followed ended the only stock market boom during Germany's relative stabilization 1924–1928. The evidence strongly suggests that the German central bank under Hjalmar Schacht was wrong to be concerned about stock prices—there was no bubble. Also, the Reichsbank was mistaken in its belief that a fall in the market would reduce the importance of short-term foreign borrowing and improve conditions in the money market. The misguided intervention had important real effects.

Our income benchmarks depart from current estimates in four crucial respects. The United States, not the United Kingdom, led in income per capita in the 1870s. The United Kingdom kept pace with the United States through the late Victorian era. Most of the United Kingdom's relative decline occurred between 1905 and 1950.

We find that policies with economic profit as the sole objective could have saved the whales, as well as increasing the incomes of the whalers, under assumptions commonly made in fisheries models. However, the necessary assumptions are implausible. Under more historically relevant assumptions we find that regulation could not have simultaneously increased profits and preserved the stock of whales.;2004;Saving the Whales: Lessons from the Extinction of the Eastern Arctic Bowhead;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

We also find an increase in inequality in the establishment wage between 1850 and 1880.

"Betran, C.; Pons, Maria A.";In this article we analyse the differences between the wages of skilled and unskilled workers in the period 1870–1930 for five countries with different levels of development and economic integration: the USA, France, the UK, Italy and Spain. We have constructed a ratio of skilled to unskilled wages (the skill premium) in the industrial sector for all these countries with the exception of the USA, for which data were already available. We study the impact of globalisation, technological and structural change and labour movements on the skill premium growth rate. The main conclusion we obtain is that the globalisation variables (migration and trade) explain only part of this growth. Technological and structural change also had an impact on the skill premium growth rate. The main responses of governments to globalisation were trade and migration policies. But as trade and migration were and are not the only sources of inequality growth, other policies had and have to be implemented.;2004;Skilled and unskilled wage differentials and economic integration, 1870-1930;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Broadberry, Stephen N.;Germany overtook Britain in comparative productivity levels for the whole economy primarily as a result of trends in services rather than trends in industry. Britain's productivity lead in services before World War II reflected external economies of scale in a highly urbanised economy with an international orientation. Low productivity in Germany reflected the underdevelopment of services in an economy that was slow to move out of agriculture. As German agricultural employment contracted sharply from the 1950s, catching-up occurred in services. This was aided by a sharp increase in human and physical capital accumulation, underpinned by the institutional framework of the postwar settlement.;2004;Explaining Anglo-German productivity differences in services since 1870;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Environmental factors are incorporated into the model. Climate is shown to be a crucial factor in determining yields but soil quality was much less important.

A consumer price index is constructed for the period, and it reveals that prices declined until 1900 and rose thereafter. Using the two new series (per caput wheat consumption and the price index), the authors estimate a demand function for wheat and show that the per caput increase was due to the rise in the real wage.;2004;The Irish grain trade from the Famine to the First World War;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Burnette, Joyce;Using a new sample of farm accounts from 84 farms throughout England, this article provides measures of regional variation and changes over time in female wages and employment in agriculture. Female wages were not fixed, but changed over time and responded to high demand for female labour. The female-male wage ratio fell between 1750 and 1850, except in the industrial north west. In 1851 approximately 19 per cent of agricultural day-labourers were female. In the industrial north west, opportunities for factory employment reduced the supply of females to agriculture, but elsewhere the relative demand for female labour in agriculture declined.;2004;The wages and employment of female day-labourers in English agriculture, 1740–1850;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
CARNEVALI, FRANCESCA;The existence of cooperation and trust between competing economic agents is taken for granted by much of the literature on industrial districts. This article explores the structure of the Birmingham jewellery-making district and the problems created by the opportunistic behaviour of many of its members. Archival sources show that the district was plagued by endemic dishonesty and that proximity did not generate trust and cooperation. The absence of barriers to entry into the trade created a district where social sanctions could not be used to reduce moral hazard. All these factors threatened to destroy the district during the crisis of the 1880s.

Human capital matters to a state's income level and to its growth rate through technological diffusion. The South, whose overwhelmingly agricultural society relied more heavily on work experience than formal education, and whose racial discrimination in school resource allocation lowered human capital accumulation of both blacks and whites, presents a unique pattern.

Costa, Dora L.;Untreated syphilis explained one-third of the higher prematurity rates of black relative to white babies born at Johns Hopkins in the early twentieth century. Differences in prematurity rates explained 41 percent of the black-white stillbirth gap and one-quarter of the black-white birth weight gap. Black babies had lower mortality and higher weight gain than white babies during the first ten days of life spent in the hospital because of higher black breast-feeding rates.

Using the undiscounted benefit-cost ratio as a proxy for the internal rate of return, the article shows that these investments were more liquid, shorter, and more profitable than private notarized credit, without higher risk. They were safer and had a shorter duration than government bonds, without being less liquid or less profitable. The conclusion, that investment in these trades was preferable to domestic alternatives, may be explained by barriers to entry.;2004;Profitability of Slave and Long-Distance Trading in Context: The Case of Eighteenth-Century France;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
DAVIS, JAMES;This article reassesses the structure of the assize of bread and its relevance for bakers and consumers in late medieval England. It has long been thought that the laws governing the manufacture and sale of bread, although adhering to a logical relationship between weight and price, were nevertheless ill-considered in formulation, calculation, and enactment and did not, in reality, provide the stable allowance recommended for bakers. By examining the economic and moral ideology underlying the assize of bread it is possible to demonstrate that legislators were actually employing a rationale that best fitted contemporary circumstances and retail practices. There nevertheless remained one fundamental flaw in its construction, which was to have implications for its enforcement.;2004;Baking for the common good: a reassessment of the assize of bread in Medieval England;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

In this article, methods used by historians of continental Europe have been developed and applied to the Durham Priory accounting material in order to create the first series of tithe-based production indicators for medieval England. The data are manipulated, and presented, to provide insight into long- and short-term trends in aggregate levels of arable production. The series of indicators are then used to examine the evidence for falling output in the late middle ages in the light of our understanding of demographic, economic, and climatic factors.;2004;Estimating arable output using Durham Priory tithe receipts, 1341–1450;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Doraszelski, Ulrich;Were nineteenth-century French firms too small? Previous research has found either constant returns to scale throughout (Nye, 1987) or increasing returns to scale for most industries (Sicsic, 1994). This research sheds some light on these contradictory results by proposing and estimating a series of models that consider previously ignored econometric issues. My analysis of the 1839–1847 census suggests that there were increasing returns to scale for some industries and constant returns for others, while the analysis of the 1861–1865 census suggests constant returns to scale throughout. Assessing the economic implications of the estimated returns to scale, I argue that there were significant unexploited scale economies in the first half of the nineteenth century. In the second half of the nineteenth century, though, France had little to gain from scale economies.;2004;Measuring returns to scale in nineteenth-century French industry;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Dye, Alan; Sicotte, Richard";This article argues that one contributing factor to the Cuban Revolution of 1959 was the 1956 revision of U.S. sugar quotas. Its significance has been overlooked because its real economic impact was programmed to occur after 1959. Combining a statistical simulation and an event study of sugar companies' rates of return on equity, we show that the revision had adverse long-run consequences for sugar exports, and that forward-looking investors anticipated them and incorporated them into their valuation of sugar-company stocks after 1953. Further evidence shows that the Batista regime and prominent insurgents understood the vital nature of Cuba's sugar import quota.;2004;The U.S. Sugar Program and the Cuban Revolution;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Before the Famine, wages proved sticky downwards in the face of falling prices; after the Famine, money wages rose faster than prices.

"Gelderblom, Oscar; Jonker, Joost";The article analyzes the evolution of the Amsterdam capital market as a consequence of Dutch overseas expansion and the introduction of transferable VOC shares. Offering investors prospects of speculative gains without serious loss of liquidity, these instruments created a booming secondary market offering a wide range of allied credit techniques. By 1609 this market had become sufficiently strong to dictate terms for new public debt issues. These findings show that, contrary to commonly held notions about the emergence of secondary markets, private finance took precedence over public finance in the Dutch Republic.;2004;Completing a Financial Revolution: The Finance of the Dutch East India Trade and the Rise of the Amsterdam Capital Market, 1595–1612;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

We offer an alternative interpretation using a theory of money demand with differential returns on nominal units and a nonoptimum nominal money stock. Our explanation is more logically appealing and more consistent with contemporary evidence. The restrictive coinage laws of the period produced chronic shortages, and our empirical analysis provides clear evidence of these shortages.

Grubb, Farley;Market transaction data are used to estimate the quantity of specie in circulation. This estimate is used to provide the first comprehensive measure of a colony's money supply and, along with data on population and prices, to retest the quantity theory of money and measure output growth using the equation of exchange. Output growth is found to depend on periodization and the extent that rising commercialization increased the velocity of circulation. Specie was becoming relatively less scarce as the Revolution approached, and movements in specie and paper currency both offset and reinforced each other depending on the period of analysis.

Grytten, Ola Honningdal;"The present article presents a consumer price index (CPI) for Norway 1819–1913. The CPI is a spliced series of three indices. For the period 1819–1871 a new and original index based on retail prices has been constructed. This new CPI is for the period 1871–1913 spliced with two cost of living indices and thereby stretches up to 1913. Thus, we conclude with a CPI for Norway for most of the nineteenth century and up to World War I.

The CPI reflects the business cycles of the period, with growing prices during upturns and shrinking prices during downturns. The series is compared to corresponding cost of living indices from Denmark and Sweden. We trace high conformity in price movements between the countries. Given the level of economic integration within the Scandinavian Currency Union from the 1870s onwards, this conformity confirms the reliability of the new CPI for Norway.";2004;A Norwegian consumer price index 1819-1913 in a Scandinavian perspective;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Hansen, Zeynep K.; Libecap, Gary D.";Federal land policy led to the establishment of farms that were too small to be viable over the long term in the northern Great Plains. Under the Homestead Act, hundreds of thousands of 160 to 320-acre farms were founded. Settlement took place during a period of unusual rainfall, but when drought returned between 1917 and 1921, such farms failed in waves of “homestead busts.” Early efforts to revise the land laws to allow for larger allocations were resisted. We examine the political economy of the Homestead Act to show why politicians opposed major policy changes. Using primary data sources, we then provide the first statistical analyses of the characteristics of farms that survived or failed during drought. We conclude with a description of the gradual process of farm-size consolidation after 1921 that led to units more reflective of the semi-arid region’s requirements.;2004;The allocation of property rights to land: US land policy and farm failure in the northern great plains;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Hatton, Timothy J.;International migration is determined by both economic and political forces. This article examines the influence of economic, demographic and policy variables on British emigration to four principal destinations in two different eras. Before 1914 the economic and demographic forces that drove British emigration can be clearly identified. Had the same conditions applied in the post-Second World War period, mass emigration from Britain would have continued until the early 1990s. But from the mid-1960s these influences became less powerful as they were increasingly inhibited by immigration policies in the principal destination countries. The long-term decline in emigration is largely accounted for by shifts in policy, especially those that curtailed or abolished the preferences previously extended to settlers from the UK.;2004;Emigration from the UK, 1870-1913 and 1950-1998;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Hautcoeur, Pierre-Cyrille;French life insurance remained underdeveloped in comparison with other countries of similar financial development during the period between 1870 and 1939. We show that technical peculiarities of the contracts used and their interaction with macroeconomic fluctuations explain the wide fluctuations we observe in insurance operations. Nevertheless, these fluctuations are not sufficient to explain the industry’s long-term stagnation. Low returns paid to clients, resulting from very conservative investment strategies, were the main reason for that stagnation, since only those interested by the life-cycle related aspects of insurance contracts continued to put money in these institutions, while most savers invested directly in the market or through State-owned financial institutions. The main reason for such an investment (and then low-growth) strategy is the existence of a set of conservative regulations and a stable oligopoly in the industry from the 1880s onwards. We suggest that established insurance companies were able to impose regulations and barriers to entry blocking the access of competitors to their market, so maintaining a hold on a small but very profitable market.;2004;Efficiency, competition, and the development of life insurance in France (1870–1939): Or: should we trust pension funds?;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Higgs, Robert;During World War II, the U.S. government displaced private investors. According to NIPA data for the period 1942–1945, net private investment was negative $6.2 billion, and net government investment was positive $99.4 billion. Although economists have credited this government investment with various contributions to wartime and postwar economic growth, the bulk of it had little or no value beyond its immediate contribution to winning the war. This episode dramatically exposes a fundamental but false assumption that underlies official data on capital formation: that all expenditures for durable producer goods or munitions form genuine capital. There are circumstances which make the consumption of capital unavoidable. A costly war cannot be financed without such a damaging measure …. There may arise situations in which it may be unavoidable to burn down the house to keep from freezing, but those who do that should realize what it costs and what they will have to do without later on.;2004;Wartime Socialization of Investment: A Reassessment of U.S. Capital Formation in the 1940s;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
HOWLETT, PETER;An important labour market development towards the end of the nineteenth century was the rise of the internal labour market. Railway companies were pioneers in this area, and this article presents an analysis of the career histories of 848 traffic staff workers of the Great Eastern Railway Company. This large longitudinal sample provides the first detailed account of the internal labour dynamics of a pre-1914 railway company, providing a unique insight into an early internal labour market. It shows that there was a clearly structured market for unskilled entrants, that promotion and demotion were an important managerial tool, and that there was a significant wage premium for promotion.;2004;The internal labour dynamics of the Great Eastern Railway Company, 1870–1913;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

By 1913 certain continental countries approached British worktimes, and, consistent with recent findings on real wages, annual hours in Old and New Worlds had converged. Although globalization did not lead to a race to the bottom of worktimes, there is only partial evidence of a race to the top.

Irwin, Douglas A.;Alexander Hamilton's “Report on Manufactures” (1791) is a classic document of U.S. economic policy, but its fate in Congress is not well known. It is commonly believed that the report was never implemented. Although Hamilton's proposals for bounties (subsidies) failed to receive support, virtually every tariff recommendation was adopted by Congress in early 1792. These tariffs were not highly protectionist because Hamilton feared discouraging imports, which were the critical tax base on which he planned to fund the public debt. As a consequence, protectionist interests shifted their political support from the Federalists to the Jeffersonian Republicans during the 1790s.;2004;The Aftermath of Hamilton's “Report on Manufactures”;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Kander, A.; Lindmark, Magnus";This article examines the evolution of energy use and pollution emissions in Sweden over the past two centuries — a much longer period than has been investigated in the large literature on the environmental Kuznets curve. In this article we show that both energy consumption and pollution emissions in Sweden declined relative to GDP over the last two hundred years. In absolute terms both energy use and pollution increased up until 1970, after which date energy consumption stabilised and pollutant emissions declined, leading to less environmental stress. The energy intensity results are decomposed to determine the relative impact of structural changes in the output structure versus within-sector changes. For the period after 1970 another decomposition for pollution emissions is performed to separate out changes in preferences from energy-related changes. The analyses show that technical change in a broad sense has been crucial for explaining the long-term decline in both energy intensity and pollutant intensity, while the transition to the service economy had negligible effects. Changed preferences affected the decline in emissions after 1970.;2004;Energy consumption, pollutant emissions and growth in the long run: Sweden through 200 years;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
KARAKACILI, EONA;It is often suggested that an agricultural revolution, currently defined as a rise in the output of arable workers, was a necessary precursor to industrialization and improved living standards. This article provides the first direct measurement of arable workers' average labor productivity for pre-industrial England. Rates are assessed for those production conditions that it is thought resulted in the lowest agrarian labor productivity rates in the pre-industrial period: c.1300–1348. The rates for English workers before the Black Death either surpassed or met the literature's best estimates for English workers until 1800, well after industrialization was underway.;2004;English Agrarian Labor Productivity Rates Before the Black Death: A Case Study;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

We find that national capital market characteristics and firm specific characteristics were important determinants of 20th century US and Canadian steel firms’ financing decisions. We also show that, despite source-specific price differences, average capital costs were approximately equal in the two countries, and the firms’ financing decisions were important determinants of these average capital costs. We conclude that firms structured their balance sheets in an effort to exploit the idiosyncratic features of their domestic financial institutions, and thereby, minimize their average capital costs.;2004;The micro-economic effects of financial market structure: evidence from 20th century North American steel firms;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
KITSIKOPOULOS, HARRY;The existing literature on the economy of medieval England views the practice of convertible husbandry as a more efficient alternative to regular common fields. The article challenges this view by measuring the productivities of the systems, which are found to be approximately equivalent. In interpreting this finding, it is suggested that edaphic conditions and wrongful managerial practices account for the poor performance of convertible husbandry during the Middle Ages, whereas the greater productivity achieved by the system in the early modern period is attributed to the introduction of fodder legumes, such as clover, which were absent in previous centuries.;2004;Convertible Husbandry vs. Regular Common Fields: A Model on the Relative Efficiency of Medieval Field Systems;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Maurer, Noel; GOMBERG, ANDREI";All sovereign governments face a commitment problem: how can they promise to honor their own agreements? The standard solutions involve reputation or political institutions capable of tying the government's hands. Mexico's government in the 1880s used neither solution. It compensated its creditors by enabling them to extract rents from the rest of the economy. These rents came through special privileges over banking services and the right to administer federal taxes. Returns were extremely high: as long as the government refrained from confiscating all their assets (let alone repaying their debts) less than twice a decade, they would break even.;2004;When the State is Untrustworthy: Public Finance and Private Banking in Porfirian Mexico;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Millward, Robert;In this article the economic organisation of the infrastructure industries of transport, communications and energy in the period 1840–1914 is analysed and the role of government evaluated. The article attempts to explain the differences in government involvement across mainly Western European countries: Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Regulation via the concession system, municipal ownership, state guarantees of bond interest, profit sharing and nationalisation can all be found. In local networks for gas, electricity and tramways the pattern of regulation was determined by the structure and powers of local government and by fiscal considerations, such as the need to generate trading profits as a non-tax revenue for those town councils seeking funds for their mounting public health programmes. At the national level, central government objectives with respect to economic growth and political unification were pursued by the use of rate-of-return guarantees and subsidies to railway companies. State ownership was to be found only when speed in construction was paramount or when network segments were especially unprofitable or, and this applied also to telegraphs, when there was a very strong desire to control information and the flow of goods and persons. Neither a distrust of capitalism nor the advent of municipal socialism were motivating forces behind public ownership.;2004;European governments and the infrastructure industries, c.1840-1914;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Moehling, Carolyn M.;Even in the early 20th century, black children were much more likely to be living apart from one or both parents than were white children. This paper examines the contribution of these racial differences in family structure to the racial differences in children’s experiences in the American South. Living apart from one or both parents was associated with lower school attendance and greater labor market participation, particularly for blacks. However, racial differences in adult literacy, household resources, and school characteristics were much more important for explaining the racial gaps in children’s activities than were racial differences in family structure.;2004;Family structure, school attendance, and child labor in the American South in 1900 and 1910;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Our new estimates confirm the precipitous decline in real freight rates before World War I, but we also extend them to 1997, a long period of relative stability. In an effort to identify the contribution of transport revolutions to global commodity price convergence, we create route-specific deflators, rather than relying on the Sauerbeck index. Finally, using the price-dual and new factor price indices, we calculate total factor productivity growth for five global routes, and then identify the sources of productivity growth along them.;2004;Freight rates and productivity gains in British tramp shipping 1869–1950;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Murray, John E.;Using individual measures of adult and child literacy, this article examines human capital acquisition in one Southern city, Charleston, 1790–1840. White adult literacy rates differed greatly by sex and class and rose gradually over time. Mothers played a critical role in human capital transmission in early childhood and long after children had left their care. Both relatively recent literacy acquisition and early childhood family structure influenced the occupation to which children were apprenticed.

"Murray, John E.; Keith, Kristen";How might earnings of men and women have differed in poor countries a century ago? We know very little but a one-worker-in-ten labor market survey conducted in Manila in 1900 can help to establish baseline earnings patterns. In terms of raw means, women's earnings were about 30 percent less than men's, but both were distributed so that in some industries there were women who earned more than the average man. Controlling for hours, occupations and firm characteristics left female earnings discounts that varied by occupation from nothing to nearly half, ceteris paribus. Women workers concentrated in relatively skilled tobacco processing work, paid by the piece. Within this industry, productivity differentials were confounded by occupational segregation, however, in which men made the more expensive cigars and women the cheaper cigars and cigarettes.;2004;Male–female earnings differentials in early 20th century Manila;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Nicolini, Esteban A.;This paper shows that the exogenous decline of adult mortality at the end of the 17th century can be one of the causes driving both the decline of interest rate and the increase in agricultural production per acre in pre-industrial England. Following the intuition of the life-cycle hypothesis, I claim that the increase in adult life expectancy must have implied less farmer impatience and it could have caused more investment in nitrogen stock and land fertility, the increase in agricultural land, and higher production per acre. I analyze this dynamic interaction using an overlapping generations model and show that the evolution of agricultural production and capital rates of return predicted by the model coincide fairly well with their empirical pattern.;2004;Mortality, interest rates, investment, and agricultural production in 18th century England;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Nightingale, Pamela;This article examines the evidence that between 1275 and 1334 the lay subsidies provide a yardstick with which to measure the English economy.

Accordingly, from c. 1300 the lay subsidies cannot be used as a guide to the distribution of wealth in England and they can offer only a limited comparison with the wealth revealed by the Tudor subsidies.;2004;The lay subsidies and the distribution of wealth in medieval England, 1275–1334;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"ODELL, KERRY A.; Weidenmier, Marc D.";"In April 1906 the San Francisco earthquake and fire caused damage equal to more than 1 percent of GNP. Although the real effect of this shock was localized, it had an international financial impact: large amounts of gold flowed into the country in autumn 1906 as foreign insurers paid claims on their San Francisco policies out of home funds. This outflow prompted the Bank of England to discriminate against American finance bills and, along with other European central banks, to raise interest rates. These policies pushed the United States into recession and set the stage for the Panic of 1907.

OGILVIE, SHEILAGH;This article considers recent economic theories about guilds in the light of evidence from a German proto-industrial region. The empirical findings cast doubt on views that guilds existed because they were efficient institutional solutions to market failures relating to product quality, training, and innovation. However, guilds did generate a ?social capital? of shared norms, common information, mutual sanctions, and collective political action. This social capital benefitted guild members, but harmed outsiders and the wider economy. The article concludes that economic theories of collective action and interlinked markets can explain why guilds were widespread while not necessarily being efficient.;2004;Guilds, efficiency, and social capital: evidence from German proto-industry;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Persson, Karl Gunnar;The conventional view asserts that sharply falling transport costs practically closed the transatlantic price gap for grain by the end of the nineteenth century. This article challenges that view on the basis of an analysis of a new data set of weekly wheat prices and freight costs from New York to UK markets. Although transport costs fell, the fall was neither sharp nor dramatic. The extent of the decline in real terms is very sensitive to the choice of deflator. It is argued that if you are assessing the trade-inhibiting effect of transport costs, the ‘freight factor’ approach, using the price of the transported good as deflator, is the appropriate one. Port charges, insurance and marketing costs also fell by the same modest rate and since these costs were almost as large as transport costs, the price gap remained substantial. One implication is that we need to look elsewhere for the causes of the dramatic increase in New World grain exports.;2004;Mind the gap!

Due to the high level of foreign debt in the banking system, the run on the currency and the deposit withdrawals reinforced each other in a vicious circle and resulted in a banking panic and the abandonment of the gold standard.";2004;The German Twin Crisis of 1931;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Scott, Peter M.; Walsh, Peter";Greater London constituted Britain's most important interwar centre for new manufacturing plants. Using a new dataset of plants established throughout London from 1919 to 1938, this article examines intra-metropolitan location patterns, together with the factors that led to heavy concentrations of plants in particular localities. Traditional sectors characterized by batch production are shown to be concentrated in sectorally specialized inner London industrial districts, benefiting from Marshallian externalities. Meanwhile, industries experiencing a transition towards standardized production became concentrated in new industrial areas along outer London's arterial road network, encompassing a diverse range of sectors using similar production methods and mainly accruing inter-sectoral ?Jacobs? externalities.;2004;Patterns and determinants of manufacturing plant location in interwar London;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Simpson, James;Attempts to stimulate wine drinking in Britain in the early 1860s succeeded in tripling wine imports, but this increase proved short lived, and per caput consumption was no greater in 1914 than it had been in 1815. Supply volatility, together with difficulties in establishing impersonal exchange mechanisms in place of those based on the personal reputation of economic agents, made it difficult to create a mass market. Not only did consumers receive insufficient information to identify quality prior to purchase, but the high price of some wines also encouraged cheap imitations, some of which were prejudicial to the health of the drinker.;2004;Selling to reluctant drinkers: the British wine market, 1860–1914;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

STEAD, DAVID;This article scrutinizes the claim that the residual claimant in English agriculture was the fixed rent tenant farmer rather than the landlord. Examination of methods of agricultural insurance and risk management indicates that the income risks of farming were sizable, not straightforward to manage, and largely borne by the tenant. Thus the farmer's profit appears to have fluctuated by more over time and space than did the rent paid to the landlord. Attempts are made to assess changes over time in the nature and size of the production and price risks to which farmers were exposed.;2004;Risk and risk management in English agriculture, c. 1750–1850;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Stockwell, Sarah;Recent studies have shown convincingly that no ?neocolonialist? conspiracies were hatched to perpetuate British commercial dominance in the former colonies after independence, and that relations between individual firms and policy-makers were frequently troubled. In acknowledging the force of this general proposition, however, there is a risk of neglecting the still significant place of commercial considerations in state policy making. By relocating the relationship of trade and empire in the 1950s in an examination of a hitherto neglected dimension of British taxation policy, this article demonstrates that the Conservative government sought to assist British business with colonial interests at a time when these firms faced new uncertainties.;2004;Trade, empire, and the fiscal context of imperial business during decolonization;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Stogbauer, C.; Komlos, John";The Great Depression in Germany led to the radicalisation of the electorate, leading the country and then the world into the darkest days of Western civilization. Could it have been otherwise? This article explores whether the NSDAP takeover might have been averted with a fiscal policy that lowered the unemployment rate in those parts of Germany where their support rose most rapidly. A counterfactual simulation model based on estimates of the relationship between unemployment and the radical vote at the electoral district level provides a framework for considering how much lower unemployment would have to have been in those districts to prevent the NSDAP from becoming a formidable political force in Germany. Budget neutrality is maintained, so that the simulations do not depend on an expanded fiscal policy. The results indicate that such a policy could well have averted the NSDAP's seizure of power, and the catastrophe that followed in its wake.;2004;Averting the Nazi seizure of power: A counterfactual thought experiment;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Suzuki, Masao;Opposition to Japanese immigration led to Alien Land Laws that barred Japanese immigrants from buying or leasing farmland. Although there is general agreement that the 1913 California Alien Land Law had little impact, historians and social scientists have differed over the effectiveness of the 1920 initiative, which closed loopholes in the earlier law. Census data show a decline in Japanese American agriculture over the short and long run, which cannot be fully explained by the agricultural downturn of the 1920s.

The combination of high wages in this frontier economy with increasing difficulties in arable agriculture as a result of the subsidence of peat soils, and the absence of feudal restrictions in production and marketing, resulted in the rise of capital-intensive industries, benefiting from converging wages and increasing market integration.;2004;The jump-start of the Holland economy during the late-medieval crisis, c.1350–c.1500;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

WEISS, THOMAS;"This article surveys the history of tourism in America from colonial times to World War II. In that time there were substantial increases in the numbers of tourists, in the extent to which middle-income classes participated, and in the number and type of tourist destinations; but most of that growth may have been confined to the period after World War I. The growth of income and reduced costs of travel no doubt explain most of the growth, but some cultural factors helped to shift out the demand curve. The industry also possesses characteristics that should make further study of interest to economic historians. “I am moved to confess that day by day the mass of my memories of the excursion have grown more and more pleasant as the disagreeable incidents of travel which encumbered them flitted one by one out of my mind.”Mark Twain, Innocents Abroad, p. 488.Mark Twain";2004;Tourism in America before World War II;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

While Britain is considered a pioneer, France has been treated as a laggard because of continued reliance on tax farming. Focusing on the largest tax farm, France's late transition from private to government tax collection is explained in a principal-agent context by the difficulties of monitoring employees and borrowing at low cost in the capital market. Tax farmers continued to earn high returns, absorbing the risk of fluctuating collections, leaving the Crown with lower revenue.;2004;From privatized to government-administered tax collection: tax farming in eighteenth-century France;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"ASTORGA, PABLO; BERGES, A. R.M.E.; FITZGERALD, VALPY";New and consistent series for Latin American real incomes, life expectancy and adult literacy over the twentieth century reveal that living standards rose most rapidly between the 1930s and 1970s, a period characterised by increased state intervention and reduced trade openness. Within the region, Brazil and Mexico advanced most over the century as a whole despite the early start made by Argentina and Chile, although convergence between larger countries was accompanied by divergence from smaller ones. There was no sustained narrowing of the income gap with the US at all between 1900 and 2000 but some convergence in living standards due to improved life expectancy. Our new estimates of regional per capita income also permit a clearer comparison with both Europe and Asia. The major advances in living standards achieved in the middle decades of the century were closely related to early industrialization, rapid urbanization, and the extension of primary health and education. Subsequent economic volatility and fiscal fragility limited further increases in living standards, undermining social consensus on development strategy.;2005;The standard of living in Latin America during the twentieth century;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Repartimiento has been depicted as a coercive system of production and consumption designed by Spaniards to draw reluctant Amerindians into the market. An examination of repartimiento through the lens of New Institutional Economics provides an alternative understanding of this credit system. Characteristics of the repartimiento most often identified as exploitative are better explained as institutional adaptations designed to facilitate contract enforcement and economize on transaction costs in this cross-cultural trade.

BRIGGS, CHRIS;Recent research into the impact of Anglo-Scottish conflict on northern England's economy has become increasingly sophisticated, using local estate accounts to enhance understanding of the role of war in the 'crisis' of the early fourteenth century. Yet taxation data also remains an important source on these issues, not least because of its wide geographical coverage. Using a rich series of lay subsidy documents for Cumberland, this article concludes that the direct impact of Scottish raids was only one of several determinants of economic fortunes. More significantly, reconstructing the process of taxation shows that non-violent resistance to state levies was as responsible as war damage for a decline in revenue from the county.;2005;Taxation, warfare, and the early fourteenth century ‘crisis’ in the north: Cumberland lay subsidies, 1332–1348;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

While the first result corroborates existing work on the positive growth effects of better institutions, the second finding is more novel to the literature.

"Clark, Gregory; Jamelske, Eric";The theoretical efficiency advantages of land site value taxation have been known since at least the writings of Adam Smith. However, the practical gains from switching land taxes to this basis have never, to our knowledge, been measured. The Tithe Commutation Act of 1836 in England switched taxation of large areas of farmland from a percentage of gross output to an equivalent lump sum tax on site values. We estimate the rent gains from this reform between 1842 and 1855 using data from 5108 English parishes. We show that converting the tithe to a lump sum raised rents, net of the tithe, by an average of £0.43 for every £1 of tithe collected. Some of these rent gains may have stemmed from increased investment by landlords in fixed capital rented with the land, so that we can only give a range for the possible excess burden of the tithe of 17–43%. Interestingly with a Cobb–Douglass production function the predicted excess burden would be 17%.;2005;The efficiency gains from site value taxes: the Tithe Commutation Act of 1836;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

[Explorations in Economic History 39 (2002) 425] represents the only empirical analysis of this issue. Alston et al., as typical for many other studies of historical regulatory movements, rely on legislative vote outcomes. In this article we examine the only occasion when a cigarette ban was put to a popular vote, in Oregon in 1930, and highlight the benefits of studying direct-democratic votes to assess support for regulatory movements. To study the relationship between the anti-cigarette movement and other reform movements of the era, we compare the determinants of support for the cigarette ban with support for an Oregon alcohol prohibition referendum in 1933. Our results suggest that supporters of both reform movements were more likely to be found in counties with higher percentages of women, evangelical Protestants, and rural residents, which contrasts with Alston et al.’s study of state legislative behavior. In addition, greater support for alcohol prohibition in particular was found in counties with a larger percentage of immigrants and, to a lesser extent, more registered Republicans.;2005;The anti-tobacco movement in the Progressive Era: A case study of direct democracy in Oregon;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Drelichman, Mauricio;"I argue that Spain's long-term economic stagnation in the seventeenth century and beyond was the result of a process triggered by the windfall acquisition of precious metals from American mines, and driven by the consolidation of absolutist rule and the peculiar privilege structure of Spanish society in the sixteenth century. American treasure allowed the Spanish monarchs to command large amounts of credit and pursue an expansive imperial policy unlike that of any other Early Modern nation; when the cost of the Empire increased and mineral rents fell, the Crown increased the fiscal pressure while allowing skilled human capital to migrate into the tax-sheltered but largely unproductive nobility. I first provide evidence on the role of the silver windfall and the acquisition of nobility titles in the sixteenth century; of particular interest is a new data series of nobility lawsuits constructed from the population of cases housed at the Archive of the Royal Chancery Court in Valladolid. I then develop a unified theoretical framework that explains imperial policy as an optimal response given the existing institutions and the natural resource windfall, recreates the rent-seeking path followed by the Spanish Crown when mineral rents proved insufficient, and accounts for the long-term economic backwardness that Spain experienced in the following centuries as the result of an institutional lock-in.";2005;All that glitters: Precious metals, rent seeking and the decline of Spain;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Eckard, E. Woodrow;I argue that a quasi team-promotion system similar to European professional sports leagues once existed in the US, contrary to common perceptions. The first American pro team sport was baseball. From the creation of the first major league in 1876 to the early 1890s, entry was common, occurring primarily by the “promotion” of clubs in operation the previous season. The informal system ended abruptly after an 1892 merger that formed the prototype closed monopoly sports league. Empirical analysis indicates that the cessation of entry reduced competitive balance, and that in their initial year promoted teams outperformed new start-ups. While historians have recognized the elimination of between-league competition as an underlying motive for the monopoly merger, the simultaneous elimination of club entry and competition for league membership has gone virtually unnoticed.;2005;Team promotion in early major league baseball and the origin of the closed sports league;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"ELTIS, DAVID; Lewis, Frank D.; RICHARDSON, DAVID";"We draw wide-ranging implications about slave productivity change by making use of newly collected data on the prices paid for nearly 230,000 slaves as they arrived in the Americas from Africa between 1674 and 1807. Prices for the product that most slaves were destined to produce-sugar-are also available. Together the comprehensive series allow us to derive annual measures of average slave productivity and to compare productivity trends across different sectors of the Caribbean. Average productivity rose throughout the Caribbean, and the pattern of average productivity change across regions was similar, indicating an open slave market. These averages mask sharp differences in the growth of demand for slaves among regions, as reflected by their slave populations. Between 1700 and 1790 the increase in demand ranged from 90 per cent in Barbados to 600 per cent in Jamaica and Cuba; while total factor productivity overall may have doubled. The slave trade accommodated the rising demand. It also served to offset population attrition among the slaves.";2005;Slave prices, the African slave trade, and productivity in the Caribbean, 1674–1807;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

World agriculture was not plagued by overproduction and falling terms of trade.

Fenoaltea, S.;This article presents new estimates of aggregate production in post-unification Italy: the first since the original Istat-Vitali estimates of some forty years ago not to recombine their component series, and to be based entirely on new research. The new 1911-price GDP series incorporates the recent Federico series for agriculture, the author's recent series for industry, and newly derived series for services that extrapolate the recent Zamagni estimates of their value added in 1911. The new time series for the 11 sectors specified by the original estimates often differ widely from their predecessors. The new aggregate yields a long-term growth rate well above that of the original series, but not as high as that of Maddison's revision. The end-of-the-century acceleration that characterised all the earlier aggregates disappears: total production followed in muted form the long swing in industrial production, which in turn reflected a simple investment cycle. The implications of the new series in the context of the ongoing debates in the literature are also briefly discussed.;2005;The growth of the Italian economy, 1861-1913: Preliminary second-generation estimates;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

On a per capita basis, we find that an additional dollar of public works and relief spending was associated with a 44 cent increase in 1939 retail sales. In contrast, the AAA seems to have had a negative effect on retail sales, suggesting that nonlandowners in the farm sector suffered disproportionate declines in income as a result of the AAA.;2005;Did New Deal Grant Programs Stimulate Local Economies?

GIEDEMAN, DANIEL C.;This article studies the effects of branch banking restrictions on American firm investment and growth. Authors have suggested that the lack of widespread branching bank networks hindered the development of large-scale industrial firms. This article presents a model that implies that restrictions on branch banking cause the severity of external finance constraints to increase with firm size. This hypothesis is tested using a panel data set of over 250 firms for 1911–1922. Investment and growth sensitivities are significantly higher for large firms than for smaller firms, suggesting that branch banking restrictions hindered the expansion of large-scale firms.;2005;Branch Banking Restrictions and Finance Constraints in Early-Twentieth-Century America;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Green, Alan G.; MacKinnon, Mary; Minns, Chris";The failure of French Canadians to settle the Canadian west before 1900, when substantial numbers of anglophones and Europeans were migrating, is a long-standing puzzle. Historians have relied mainly on cultural explanations. Using new data, we demonstrate that anglophones and francophones had very different personal characteristics, so that movement to the west was rarely economically attractive for francophones. However, large-scale migration into New England fitted French Canadians' demographic and human capital profile. Even if the United States had imposed immigration restrictions by the 1880s, this would not likely have diverted many French Canadians westward.;2005;Conspicuous by their Absence: French Canadians and the Settlement of the Canadian West;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Hatton, Timothy J.; Boyer, George R.";During the ‘golden age’ of the 1950s and 1960s unemployment in Britain averaged 2 per cent. This was far lower than ever before or since and a number of hypotheses have been put forward to account for this unique period in labour market history. But there has been little attempt to isolate precisely how the determinants of wage setting and unemployment differed before, during and after the golden age. We estimate a two-equation model over the whole period from 1872 to 1999 using a newly constructed set of long-run labour market data. We find that the structure of real wage setting was different in the golden age, consistent with notions about the postwar consensus, but it did not result in wages that were significantly lower relative to productivity than during other eras. Rapid growth in productivity and world trade together with low interest rates did keep unemployment lower during the golden age than after the 1970s. But the key difference between the golden age and the periods before and after was shifts in labour demand that are not accounted for by any of the variables that are usually thought to determine the equilibrium unemployment rate.;2005;Unemployment and the UK labour market before, during and after the Golden Age;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The problem of contract enforcement in the English East India Company reflected a multi-task principal-agent problem in which servants traded publicly for the company and at the same time conducted their own private trade. Private trade, sustained by the private use of company resources, and dismissals were the mechanisms that made East India contracts work. Mechanisms that served little purpose were salaries and pre-employment bonds.;2005;Contract Enforcement in the English East India Company;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"HENRIKSEN, INGRID; Hviid, M.";During the late nineteenth century, technologies to measure the quality of the milk in butter production became available, enabling creameries to pay suppliers of raw milk according to quality. Having identified the advantages to the creameries in terms of incentive provision, we demonstrate that the diffusion among the cooperative creameries was relatively slow, particularly relative to other technologies adopted by the same creameries over the same period, with a large number ‘dragging their feet’. We also observe that late adopters often did not choose the most up-to-date technology and that early adopters who later upgraded their technology in many cases did not choose the current best practice. We consider a number of reasons for the observed patterns, which are at odds with the co-operative creameries being seen as technologically ‘savvy’. A proper implementation created both winners and losers among suppliers, and the size of these widened with newer versions of the technology. We show that the slow and inappropriate implementation can be explained by the need to get the technology accepted by a sufficient number of suppliers.;2005;Diffusion of new technology and complementary best practice: A case study;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

This decline contrasted with steady or increasing seasonality elsewhere. Monthly butter prices in Britain, Denmark, and Ireland show that the incentives to shift into winter dairying were particularly high in the 1880s and 1890s; however, this cannot on its own explain the Danish shift, since our price data show that farmers elsewhere faced winter premia that were every bit as high as the Danish premia. The crucial factor in Denmark was the generation of empirical knowledge by the private and public sectors systematically analysing empirical evidence; the rapid diffusion of this knowledge in a highly educated society via lectures, exhibitions, written materials, and by institutions such as the new cooperative sector; and a willingness to absorb this knowledge by profit-maximizing farmers.";2005;Incentives, technology and the shift to year-round dairying in late nineteenth-century Denmark;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The most fundamental contribution of the paper is in consistently sketching the course of commodity market integration over the long run. Additionally, this study suggests that the nineteenth century has been somewhat misread in terms of the development of markets as the evidence, especially on price convergence, points to dramatic improvements in intra- and international market integration in the years prior to the mid-century. A collective task for economic historians, then, is to link these developments with the revolutionary commercial and technological developments of the post-1850 period.;2005;Intra- and international commodity market integration in the Atlantic economy, 1800–1913;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Kim, Sukkoo;Industrialization and urbanization are seen as interdependent processes of modern economic development. However, the exact nature of their causal relationship is still open to considerable debate. This paper uses firm-level data from the manuscripts of the decennial censuses between 1850 and 1880 to examine whether the adoption of the steam engine as the primary power source by manufacturers during industrialization contributed to urbanization. While the data indicate that steam-powered firms were more likely to locate in urban areas than water-powered firms, the adoption of the steam engine did not contribute substantially to urbanization.;2005;Industrialization and urbanization: Did the steam engine contribute to the growth of cities in the United States?;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

There is also strong evidence that credit markets for American state bonds were tighter in the USA than in London between 1839 and 1842.

Klovland, Jan Tore;In a sample that contains annual prices of 39 selected commodities in Britain and Germany in the period 1850 to 1913, substantial evidence of well integrated commodity markets is found. The degree of integration is not universal across markets and varies over time, however. Absolute price variability was in general decreasing over the period, indicating more closely integrated markets. But the reintroduction of tariffs in Germany beginning in 1879 implied that this trend was broken for a number of agricultural commodities. With the exception of animal foodstuffs, which were affected by non-tariff barriers, most price series are cointegrated. The speed of adjustments of prices, measured by estimates of the half-life of Law of One Price (LOP) deviations, is often in the range of 1 to 1.5 years, which is lower than that found in many other studies of market integration.;2005;Commodity market integration 1850-1913: Evidence from Britain and Germany;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Klug, Adam; Landon-Lane, John S.; White, Eugene Nelson";Contemporary observers viewed the recession that began in the summer of 1929 as nothing extraordinary. Using a neglected data set of forecasts by railroad shippers, we find that business was surprised by the magnitude of the Great Depression. We show that simple time series methods would have produced much smaller forecast errors than those indicated by the surveys, thus indicating that the survey forecasts were formed using more information than just the past history of the series. The depth and duration of the depression was beyond the experience of business, which appears to have believed that recovery would happen quickly as in previous recessions. Forecasts of inflation are then constructed using the survey forecasts.

"Koepke, Nikola; Baten, Jörg";This study offers the first anthropometric estimates of the biological standard of living in Europe during the first millennium AD, and extends the literature on the second millennium. The overall picture drawn from our data is one of stagnant heights. There was no large-scale progress in European nutritional status over the period studied, not even for the period between 1000 and 1800, for which recent GDP per capita estimates indicate increasing development. We find that heights stagnated in Central, Western and Southern Europe during the Roman imperial period, while astonishingly increasing in the fifth and sixth centuries. Noteworthy also is the similarity of height development in the three large regions of Europe. In an exploratory regression analysis of height determinants, population density turns out to have been an economically (not statistically) significant and negative factor, indicating the relevance of decreasing marginal product theories and Malthusian theory for the pre-1800 period. Of marginal significance, however, were climate (warmer temperatures being favourable for a good nutritional status), social inequality and gender inequality (both reducing average height). Lastly, we also discuss the limitations of our approach.;2005;The biological standard of living in Europe during the last two millennia;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"LAW, MARC T.; Kim, Sukkoo";"During the Progressive Era, advances in knowledge and specialization led to the emergence of modern-day professions. This growth in professions was accompanied by the adoption of occupational licensing regulation. In this article we explore the origins and effects of occupational licensing regulation during this period. Although most studies argue that occupational licensing regulation is adopted to restrict entry and reduce competition, the evidence from the Progressive Era suggests that regulation arose to improve markets as specialization and advances in knowledge made it increasingly difficult for consumers to judge the quality of professional services.

Not long ago, the Governor of a midwestern state was approached by representatives of a particular trade anxious to enlist the Governor's support in securing passage of legislation to license their trade.“Governor,” the men said, “passage of this licensing act will ensure that only qualified people will practice this occupation; it will eliminate charlatans, incompetents or frauds; and it will thereby protect the safety and welfare of the people of this state.”The governor, from long experience, was somewhat skeptical. “Gentlemen,” he asked, “are you concerned with advancing the health, safety and welfare of the people under the police powers of the state, or are you primarily interested in creating a monopoly situation to eliminate competition and raise prices?”The spokesman for the occupational group smiled and said, “Governor, we're interested in a little of each.”Council of State GovernmentsCouncil of State Governments, Occupational Licensin g, p. 1.";2005;Specialization and Regulation: The Rise of Professionals and the Emergence of Occupational Licensing Regulation;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Mitchener, Kris James;Even after controlling for local economic conditions, differences in supervision and regulation help explain the large variation in state bank suspension rates across U.S. counties during the Great Depression. More stringent capital requirements lowered suspension rates whereas laws prohibiting branch banking and imposing high reserve requirements raised them. States whose bank supervisors could liquidate banks minimized contagion and credit-channel dislocations and experienced lower suspension rates. Those that gave their supervisors sole authority to issue bank charters and granted their supervisors long terms strengthened the incentives for bank lobbyists to influence supervisory decisions and consequently experienced higher rates of suspension.;2005;Bank Supervision, Regulation, and Instability During the Great Depression;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Moore, Lyndon; Kaluzny, Jakub";We consider the effect of the three largest regime changes following World War One on the foreign debt repayments of the succeeding regimes. The Bolsheviks repudiated the Tsarist debt, both external and internal in early 1918, and could not borrow internationally until the 1970s. The Austro-Hungarian successor states, with the exception of Romania, remained on good terms with lenders, and quickly gained access to foreign capital. However, the Ottoman successor states entered into protracted negotiations before accepting responsibility for a share of the debt, which meant they faced a lengthy delay before being able to re-enter the international capital market. We analyze these events using a game theoretical model of incomplete information, whereby capital markets can not directly observe a government’s ‘type.’ We find that there were two main economic reasons why countries did not settle their debts after their regimes changed. Some countries, in particular Russia, did not value continued credit market access as highly as before, and second that international lenders will not trust a regime in default with a new loan.;2005;Regime change and debt default: the case of Russia, Austro-Hungary, and the Ottoman empire following World War One;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

By the late fourteenth century, some merino wools were being used in some Italian draperies; but, in the north, long-held historic prejudices against 'Spanish' wools hindered their introduction, especially into the Low Countries' draperies, which, because of structural changes in international trade, had become re-oriented to manufacturing luxury woollens, most woven from the finest English wools. From the 1420s, however, disastrous changes in England's fiscal policies so increased the cost of these exported wools that many of the younger Flemish draperies, the so-called nouvelles draperies, producing imitations of the finer woollens from the older established draperies, decided to switch to Spanish merino wools (often mixed with English wools). By the mid-fifteenth century, the merinos had indeed improved enough in quality to rival at least the mid-range English wools. Most of the traditional draperies, however, did not adopt merino wools until much too late, and thus, by the early sixteenth century found themselves displaced by the nouvelle draperies as the leading cloth manufacturers in the Low Countries.";2005;Spanish merino wools and the nouvelles draperies: an industrial transformation in the late medieval Low Countries;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

It explains the system's origins, and its dependence on a series of relationships involving check traders and their agents, retailers, and customers. Data from the market leader? Provident Clothing and Supply Co. Ltd?is analysed to explore the scale and scope of the sector, and to examine its history from the early 1920s to the 1960s. Check trading was both an important and controversial supplier of credit to working-class families, and the article explores criticisms of the system, and the reason for its popularity.;2005;Working-class consumer credit in the UK, 1925–60: the role of the check trader;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

During this period, public sector enforcement of contracts was imperfect. Kabu nakama substituted for the public sector, using a multilateral punishment strategy. When the government (Bakufu) prohibited kabu nakama in 1841, the growth rate of the real money supply contracted, efficiency of price arbitrage declined, and the inflation rate increased.;2005;The role of the merchant coalition in pre-modern Japanese economic development: an historical institutional analysis;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"OKAZAKI, TETSUJI; Sawada, Michiru; YOKOYAMA, KAZUKI";In prewar Japan, many banks were controlled by industrial companies through capital and personal relationships. The literature has pointed out that those banks engaged in unsound lending to their related companies, which resulted in damage to the financial system (organ bank hypothesis). In this article we examine this hypothesis by measuring director interlocking between banks and nonbanking companies. It was found that more than 80 percent of ordinary banks had director interlocking with at least one nonbanking company. Also, regression analyses confirmed that director interlocking had a negative effect on bank performance, especially for smaller banks.;2005;Measuring the Extent and Implications of Director Interlocking in the Prewar Japanese Banking Industry;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Richardson, Gary;The prudent peasant mitigated the risk of crop failures by scattering his arable land throughout his village, Deirdre McCloskey argued, because alternative risk-sharing institutions did not exist. But, alternatives did exist, this essay concludes. Medieval English peasants formed two types of farmers' cooperatives. Fraternities protected members from the perils of everyday life. Customary poor laws redistributed resources towards villagers beset by bad luck. In both institutions, the expectation of reciprocation motivated farmers with surpluses to aid neighbors with shortages.;2005;The Prudent Village: Risk Pooling Institutions in Medieval English Agriculture;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Rousseau, Peter L.; Sylla, Richard";Studies of early US growth traditionally emphasize real-sector explanations for an acceleration that is evident by the period 1815–1840. Interestingly, establishment of the nation's modern financial structure predated by three decades the transportation improvements and widespread use of water- and steam-powered machinery that are thought to have triggered modernization. We argue that an innovative and expanding financial system, by providing debt and equity financing to businesses and governments as new technologies emerged, was central to early growth and modernization. To test the hypothesis, we employ a set of multivariate time series models that relate measures of banking and equity market activity to investment and business incorporations from 1790 to 1850. The results support the hypothesis of “finance-led” growth. Our new view is at odds with earlier views that emphasize the deficiencies rather than the advantages of the early US financial system.;2005;Emerging financial markets and early US growth;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

This article sets out to analyse the underlying economic arrangements of the film industries of the United States and Britain during the decade for producing and diffusing this commodity type to the population at large. It finds a highly competitive industry that was built around showing films that audiences wanted to see, irrespective of the extent of vertical integration. It also examines the nature of the relationship between the two industries and finds an asymmetry between the popularity of British films in the American market and that of American films in the British market. The explanation offered is that the efforts of British firms in the American market were not sufficiently sustained to make a significant impact on American audiences.;2005;The film business in the United States and Britain during the 1930s;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Shiue, Carol H.;Over the first half of the nineteenth century, the Prussian-German customs union known as the Zollverein gradually unified a scattered confederation of sovereign states under an internal free trade agreement. This article uses grain prices to quantify the differential effect of the Zollverein for market integration among Zollverein members versus European powers that were not part of the Zollverein, including France, Switzerland, and the Habsburg Empire of Austria. Overall, this border effect is consistently and substantially less than border effect estimates from contemporary samples. For the 1834 liberalisation round, the implied border effect, calculated as the implied decrease in distance that comes about as the result of the customs border being eliminated, is between 140 and 160 kilometres, with the smaller distance for non-German speaking cities, and the larger distance for German—speaking cities. Thus, common language in this sample provides an additional benefit of lowering trade barriers of 11–15 per cent, making border elimination more valuable among German-speaking cities than for mixed-language-speaking cities. The article offers a few reasons for why I estimate smaller border effects than are found in studies on twentieth century economies, and the analysis gives a new historical perspective on what drives trade costs and changes in market integration.;2005;From political fragmentation towards a customs union: Border effects of the German Zollverein, 1815 to 1855;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Silvestre, Javier;Industrialisation in European countries caused an increase in both internal migration and emigration. Internal migrants were even more numerous than overseas emigrants. However, few empirical studies have sought to explain internal migrations. This article examines the causes and effects of internal migration in Spain with the aim of answering some of the questions debated in the literature. The results show that internal migrations in Spain were driven by economic forces. Moreover, the lag in rural population transfer can be explained by the scant pull of industrial and urban destinations. The article also shows that internal migrants differed in some respects from the people who emigrated overseas. Finally, the impact of internal migration on labour markets is measured.;2005;Internal migrations in Spain, 1877-1930;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Summerhill, William R.;Railroad development had a profound impact in nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century Brazil. Direct benefits were small for passengers, but large for freight services, and contributed heavily to the transition from stagnation to growth. Domestic-use activities received a differentially large stimulus. Estimates of the social rate of return reveal that Brazil did not overinvest in railroads. A different allocation of subsidies to railroad capital could have generated additional gains. Backward linkages did little for industry, but the “leakage” attributable to imported inputs was modest. Institutional externalities were mixed. By 1913 railroads had paved the way for dramatically improved economic growth.;2005;Big Social Savings in a Small Laggard Economy: Railroad-Led Growth in Brazil;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Temin, Peter; Voth, Hans-Joachim";Crowding out during the British Industrial Revolution has long been one of the leading explanations for slow growth during the Industrial Revolution, but little empirical evidence exists to support it. We argue that examinations of interest rates are fundamentally misguided, and that the 18th- and early 19th-century private loan market balanced through quantity rationing. Using a unique set of observations on lending volume at a London goldsmith bank, Hoare’s Bank, we document the impact of wartime financing on private credit markets. We conclude that there is considerable evidence that government borrowing, especially during wartime, crowded out private credit.;2005;Credit rationing and crowding out during the industrial revolution: evidence from Hoare’s Bank, 1702–1862;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
THOMSON, J. K. J.;Cotton was central to Catalan industrialization and, within cotton, progress in spinning and weaving, originating in the late eighteenth century, provided the cutting edge in the industry's modernization. This article tests the current orthodoxy concerning the timing and causes of this breakthrough. It does so by first evaluating what were external influences on the success-government policy, the elasticity of supply of spun yarn (a potential disincentive) and of raw cotton-and then providing an analytical narrative of the advance first in hand and then mechanical spinning. On this basis a conclusion is reached that government policy was more advantageous to the development than posited in the current orthodoxy, that elasticity in the supply of spun yarn slowed the transition and that, though growing availability of American cotton eased the transition, the key to the development is to be found within the Catalan economy, experiencing a 'Smithian'-type growth process in the eighteenth century, within which industrialization of cotton was nearly the last achievement before Spain's severe 'old régime crisis' curtailed economic opportunity.;2005;Explaining the ‘take-off’ of the Catalan cotton industry;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Tomlinson, Jim;The rise and consolidation of national economic management is one of the key themes of British economic and political history in the middle decades of the twentieth century. This article seeks to complement the existing substantial literature focused upon elite economic policy-making processes with an analysis of how that economic management has been accompanied by persistent government attempts to develop and popularize new understandings of 'the economy'. In this way, governments were involved in a profound shift in their relationship with the wider society, as they sought to shape the beliefs and behaviour of producers, consumers, and the public in general. The article attempts to link the elite discourse of national economic management to the attempts to shape popular understandings about the economy, and the (problematic) impact of these understandings on behaviour. The particular focus is on the 1960s, when these attempts reached some kind of culmination.;2005;Managing the economy, managing the people: Britain c.1931–70;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

WALLIS, JOHN JOSEPH;Between 1842 and 1852, eleven states adopted new constitutions, simultaneously creating procedures for issuing government debt and for chartering corporations through general incorporation acts. Why simultaneously? Voters wanted geographically specific infrastructure investments but opposed geographically widespread taxation. States resolved the dilemma by developing several innovative public finance schemes. One, “taxless finance,” used borrowed funds and special corporate privileges without raising current taxes. Another scheme, “benefit taxation,” coordinated the incidence of taxes with the geographic benefits of investments through the property tax. After the fiscal crisis of the early 1840s, states changed their constitutions to eliminate taxless finance in the future.;2005;Constitutions, Corporations, and Corruption: American States and Constitutional Change, 1842 to 1852;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

We find that ownership becomes more dispersed amongst individuals from a broader social and geographical spectrum. However, there appears to be little impact on portfolio diversification. Furthermore, although limited liability appears to contribute to the rise of the professional director, the evidence suggests that managerial incentives may have been weakened.;2006;The impact of limited liability on ownership and control: Irish banking, 1877–1914;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Baltzer, M.;This study deals with the price building process of cross-listed stocks on the most important European stock exchanges in the 1870s. By applying a vector error correction approach we look for cointegration relationships. Obviously, there was already a high degree of cross-border integration. Furthermore, we observe the uncommon phenomenon that it was not the home market Vienna but the foreign market Berlin which was the dominant one in the price-building process. An explanation could be the intense speculation during the 1870s in Berlin. Therefore, cross-listed stocks worked as a vehicle for spreading the ongoing speculation from Berlin to other places.;2006;Cross-listed stocks as an information vehicle of speculation: Evidence from European cross-listings in the early 1870s;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Battilossi, Stefano;Despite a stream of information from recent research, as well as analytical interpretations, we still lack a general picture of pre-1914 multinational banking based on a unifying empirical approach comparable to that recently developed by financial economists for the wave of banks' multinational expansion in the late twentieth century. The main purpose of this article, based on a unique dataset covering the foreign branches of British, French and German banks from 1880 to 1913, is to test in a similar theoretically-driven fashion the determinants of multinational banking during the first globalisation. The empirical strategy is based on an augmented gravity model in which geography and institutions interact with economic factors in determining the patterns of multinational banking. Contrary to what has emerged from recent studies on present multinational banking, I find that the ‘fundamentals’ of pre-1914 foreign branching cannot easily be fitted into a gravity-like model, and that no unifying pattern of foreign expansion can be inferred from the data.;2006;The determinants of multinational banking during the first globalisation 1880-1914;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Bordo, Michael D.; Rousseau, Peter L.";Recent cross-country investigations of the role of institutional fundamentals, such as the protection of property rights, in promoting financial development have extended a literature that has for decades maintained that financial factors can affect real outcomes. In this article we pursue this new direction by considering relationships between finance, growth, legal origin, and the political environment in a historical cross-section of 17 countries covering the period from 1880 to 1997. We find that relationships between a country's legal origin (such as English, French, German, or Scandinavian) and financial development are for the most part consistent with earlier findings but are not persistent. At the same time, political variables such as proportional representation election systems, frequent elections, universal female suffrage, and infrequent revolutions or coups seem linked to larger financial sectors and higher conditional rates of economic growth. Despite the explanatory power of some of our measures of the deeper fundamentals, however, a significant part of the growth-enhancing role of financial development remains unexplained by them.;2006;Legal-political factors and the historical evolution of the finance-growth link;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Using a selection of manufacturing industries we test the impact that output volatility, the benefit-wage ratio, and trade union density had on short-time working. We find that persistence effects (captured by lagged values of output fluctuation) and gender differences in trade union density were important for a number of industries. However, perhaps our most interesting finding is that the benefit-wage ratio also exercised a statistically significant impact on short-time working. This suggests that the Benjamin-Kochin thesis may be important after all. In other words, the army of short-time workers that existed in Britain between the Wars may, indeed, have been a ‘volunteer army’.;2006;A very peculiar practice: Underemployment in Britain during the interwar years;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

This paper focuses on aggregate and sectoral labor productivity in the two countries during the nineteenth century. We build on earlier work by Broadberry to push comparative productivity estimates back to 1840 based on a time series projection from a 1910 benchmark and checked against a benchmark estimate for 1850. The results indicate that labor productivity in agriculture was broadly equal in the two countries, and that the United States had a substantial labor productivity lead in industry as early as 1840, while the United Kingdom was ahead in services. Hence aggregate labor productivity and per capita incomes were higher in the United Kingdom in the mid-nineteenth century, particularly since the United States had a larger share of the labor force in low value-added agriculture and a smaller share of the population in the labor force.;2006;Labor productivity in the United States and the United Kingdom during the nineteenth century;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

This is exemplified by Praed & Co. of Truro, which was heavily engaged in financing the adoption of a risky new technology—Watt steam engines—by Cornish copper mines in the period 1775–1800.

Before the age of 30 wage growth was more rapid than increases in strength, but less rapid than wage growth among factory workers.

The Transfer Ledgers record roughly 7,000 transfers during 1720, while the Ledger Books from 1720?25 record over 8,000 individuals holding stock. The analysis finds the customer base had breadth and depth, comprising individuals from across the social spectrum, from all over England and Europe. The market was diverse and liquid. Activity during the Bubble came from those living in and around London, with most traders participating in the market only twice at most. While the majority of participants were men, there was a sizeable female presence. Men as a group lost money from their market activity, but women made money. In the five years after the Bubble, the customer base was sustained. The analysis argues that the secondary market in financial assets cannot be dismissed as mere gambling devices, and that the basis for a mutually productive interaction between the financial sector and the real sector of the economy was already in existence and was sustained through the shock of the South Sea Bubble and its collapse.;2006;The micro-foundations of the early London capital market: Bank of England shareholders during and after the South Sea Bubble, 1720–25;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Carlson, Leonard A.; Roberts, Mark A.";In May 1830, the U.S. House of Representatives narrowly passed the Indian Removal Act that authorized the president of the United States to exchange land west of the Mississippi River for Indian land in the east and appropriated $500,000 to assist tribes in the move west. Three days later the House also passed the Preemption Act of 1830, giving squatters a right of first refusal to purchase land they had occupied prior to its being opened for sale. In a recent paper, Kanazawa (1996) finds that the willingness of squatters to illegally occupy federal lands greatly raised the cost of enforcing property rights and this was a significant factor behind the passage of the first general Preemption Act in 1830. We build on his work to test the hypothesis that Congressmen who favored squatters’ rights would also favor moving Indian tribes out of the old southwest. A logit analysis of the vote on the Removal Act of 1830 shows three statistically significant variables. Democrats, representatives from slaveholding districts, and those who voted for preemption were more likely to vote for removal. Congressmen from slave states were very likely to favor both Acts, which stands in contrast to southern opposition to a homestead act in the late 1850s.;2006;Indian lands, “Squatterism,” and slavery: Economic interests and the passage of the indian removal act of 1830;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Clark, Gregory; Hamilton, Gillian";Fundamental to the Malthusian model of pre-industrial society is the assumption that higher income increased reproductive success. Despite the seemingly inescapable logic of this model, its empirical support is weak. We examine the link between income and net fertility using data from wills on reproductive success, social status and income for England 1585–1638. We find that for this society, close to a Malthusian equilibrium, wealth robustly predicted reproductive success. The richest testators left twice as many children as the poorest. Consequently, in this static economy, social mobility was predominantly downwards. The result extends back to at least 1250 in England.;2006;Survival of the Richest: The Malthusian Mechanism in Pre-Industrial England;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Coşgel, Metin M.;Governments can tax productive activities with either uniform or discriminatory rates among taxpayers. Although discriminatory rates can cause productive inefficiency and require high cost of administration, they can be preferred because of their advantage in distributional flexibility. This paper studies the discriminatory taxation of production in the Fertile Crescent. Using information from the Ottoman tax registers, it examines the basis, distortionary effects, and distributional consequences of discriminatory rates quantitatively. The results challenge widely held beliefs about the basis for discriminatory rates in this region and the Ottoman government’s motivation in adapting systems of taxation in newly conquered lands.;2006;Taxes, efficiency, and redistribution: Discriminatory taxation of villages in Ottoman Palestine, Southern Syria, and Transjordan in the sixteenth century;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Costa, Dora L.; KAHN, MATTHEW E.";By the end of the Civil War 186,017 black men had served in the Union Army, roughly three-quarters of whom were former slaves. Because most black soldiers were illiterate farm workers, the war exposed them to a much broader world. Their wartime experience depended upon their peers, their commanding officers, and where their regiment toured and affected their later life outcomes. In the short run the combat units benefited from company homogeneity, which built social capital and minimized shirking, but in the long run men's human capital and acquisition of information was best improved by serving in heterogeneous companies.;2006;Forging a New Identity: The Costs and Benefits of Diversity in Civil War Combat Units for Black Slaves and Freemen;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Crafts, Nicolas F. R.; MULATU, ABAY";This article explores the location of industry in pre–World War I Britain using a model that takes account both of factor endowment and also of New Economic Geography influences. Broadly speaking, the pattern of industrial location in this period was quite persistent and regional specialization changed little. The econometric results show that factor endowments had much stronger effects than proximity to markets, although the latter was an attraction for industries with large plant size. Overall, falling transport costs had relatively little effect on industrial location at a time when proximity to natural resources, notably coal, mattered most.;2006;How Did the Location of Industry Respond to Falling Transport Costs in Britain Before World War I?;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Davis, Joseph H.;The NBER's pre–World War I dating of business cycles implies that the U.S. economy spent nearly every other year in recession. This article extends earlier efforts at redating for the 1796–1914 period using a single metric: Davis's (2004) annual industrial production index. The new chronology alters more than 40 percent of the peak and troughs and removes the most questionable cycles. An important implication of this is the lack of discernible differences in the frequency and duration of industrial cycles among the pre–Civil War, Civil War to World War I, and post–World War II periods.;2006;An Improved Annual Chronology of U.S. Business Cycles since the 1790s;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"DIMSDALE, NICHOLAS H.; HORSEWOOD, NICHOLAS; van Riel, Arthur";This article contributes to the debate on the causes of unemployment in interwar Germany. It applies the Layard-Nickell model of the labor market to interwar data. The results indicate that demand shocks, combined with nominal inertia in the labor market, were important in explaining unemployment. Real wage pressures due to procedures for wage determination were a major influence on unemployment, but were partly offset by movements in other supply-side variables, such as the replacement ratio and the pricing policy of cartels. Demand- and supply-side variables were mutually reinforcing in the Great Depression and in the recovery under the Nazis.;2006;Unemployment in Interwar Germany: An Analysis of the Labor Market, 1927–1936;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Dye, Alan; Sicotte, Richard";"Theories of cartel stability assume detection is uncertain, but also unambiguous. Recent empirical studies find that cartel agreements are contractually incomplete. If so, whether an action constitutes violation may be ambiguous. While theory emphasizes the ineffectiveness of agreements that are not fully specified ex ante, recent research shows that stable cartels may often renegotiate terms to eliminate loopholes caused by incompleteness. Naturally, renegotiations can lead to breakdowns, but sometimes threats of breakdown are resolved. This paper examines the strategy adopted by Cuban negotiators to resolve a near breakdown in the International Sugar Agreement of 1931. Cuba made a threat of retaliation credible by using a strategy of brinkmanship. The paper contributes to recent empirical work, such as Levenstein [Explorations in Economic History 33 (1996) 107; Journal of Industrial Economics 45 (2) (1997) 117] and Genesove and Mullin [American Economic Review 91 (3) (2001) 379], which uses the economics of organization to interpret cartel behavior.";2006;How brinkmanship saved Chadbourne: Credibility and the International Sugar Agreement of 1931;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Ewert, U. C.;Having been separated into numerous autonomous states, nineteenth-century Germany was the very model of a regionally diversified process of industrialisation. How the nutritional status of Germans developed during early industrialisation is analysed in this article. With newly available data, average height for birth cohorts 1770–1849 is established for the two German states of Saxony and Wuerttemberg. The development of these heights is compared to the — so far — sole German height trend of this epoch, the average height of Bavarians. The results suggest that, starting with the birth cohorts of the Napoleonic era, the biological standard of living was on the decline across all the three German territories under consideration. An explorative interpretation of the height trend in Saxony reveals that during the beginning of industrialisation a mixture of relatively bad climatic conditions, rising prices of foodstuffs and a persistently falling real income can be held responsible for the rapid and substantial decline of the nutritional status in this pioneering state of German industrialisation. Finally, by the middle of the nineteenth century the Saxons found themselves trapped in a classical type of nutritional crisis.;2006;The biological standard of living on the decline: Episodes from Germany during early industrialisation;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
FERGUSON, NIALL;This article uses price data and editorial commentaries from the contemporary financial press to measure the impact of political events on investors? expectations from the middle of the nineteenth century until the First World War. The main question addressed is why political events appeared to affect the world's biggest financial market, the London bond market, much less between 1881 and 1914 than they had between 1843 and 1880. In particular, I ask why the outbreak of the First World War, an event traditionally seen as having been heralded by a series of international crises, was not apparently anticipated by investors. The article considers how far the declining sensitivity of the bond market to political events was a result of the spread of the gold standard, increased international financial integration, or changes in the fiscal policies of the great powers. I suggest that the increasing national separation of bond markets offers a better explanation. However, even this structural change cannot explain why the London market was so slow to appreciate the risk of war in 1914. To investors, the First World War truly came as a bolt from the blue.;2006;Political risk and the international bond market between the 1848 revolution and the outbreak of the First World War;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"FERGUSON, NIALL; Schularick, Moritz";This article reassesses the importance of colonial status to investors before 1914 by means of multivariable regression analysis of the data available to contemporaries. We show that British colonies were able to borrow in London at significantly lower rates of interest than noncolonies precisely because of their colonial status, which mattered more than either gold standard adherence or the sustainability of fiscal policies. The “empire effect” was, on average, a discount of around 100 basis points, rising to around 175 basis points for the underdeveloped African and Asian colonies. Colonial status significantly reduced the default risk perceived by investors.;2006;The Empire Effect: The Determinants of Country Risk in the First Age of Globalization, 1880–1913;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Field, Alexander J.;Manufacturing contributed almost all—83 percent—of the growth of total factor productivity in the U.S. private nonfarm economy between 1919 and 1929. During the depression manufacturing TFP growth was not as uniformly distributed, and only half as rapid, accounting for only 48 percent of PNE TFP growth. Yet the overall growth of the residual between 1929 and 1941 was the highest of any comparable period in the twentieth century. This resulted from the combination of a still potent manufacturing contribution with advances in transportation, public utilities, and distribution, fueled in part by investments in public infrastructure.;2006;Technological Change and U.S. Productivity Growth in the Interwar Years;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Fishback, Price V.; Horrace, William C.; Kantor, Shawn Everett";Using county-level data on federal New Deal expenditures on public works and relief and Agricultural Adjustment Administration payments to farmers, this paper empirically examines the New Deal’s impact on inter-county migration from 1930 to 1940. We construct a net-migration measure for each county as the difference between the Census’s reported population change from 1930 to 1940 and the natural increase in population (births minus infant deaths minus non-infant deaths) over the same period. Our empirical approach accounts for both the simultaneity between New Deal allocations and migration and the geographic spillovers that likely resulted when economic activity in one county may have affected the migration decisions of people in neighboring counties. We find that greater spending on relief and public works was associated with significant migration into counties where such money was allocated. The introduction of our modern farm programs under the aegis of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration appears to have contributed to a net out-migration that sped the transition of people out of farming.;2006;The impact of New Deal expenditures on mobility during the Great Depression;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Flandreau, Marc;This article examines the historical record of the Austro-Hungarian monetary union, focusing on its bargaining dimension. As a result of the 1867 Compromise, Austria and Hungary shared a common currency, although they were fiscally sovereign and independent entities. By using repeated threats to quit, Hungary succeeded in obtaining more than proportional control and forcing the common central bank into a policy that was very favourable to it. Using insights from public economics, this article explains the reasons for this outcome. Because Hungary would have been able to secure quite good conditions for itself had it broken apart, Austria had to provide its counterpart with incentives to stay on board. I conclude that the eventual split of Hungary after World War I was therefore not ‘written on the wall’ in 1914, since the Austro-Hungarian monetary union was quite profitable to Hungarians.;2006;The logic of compromise: Monetary bargaining in Austria-Hungary, 1867-1913;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Fratianni, Michele; Spinelli, Franco";The term financial revolution has been abused in the literature. Revolution connotes a sharp and unique break from the past that should stand up to careful historical scrutiny, but in fact it does not. Evolution describes financial history better than revolutions. We compare the classic ‘financial revolutions’ with the financial innovations of Genoa, Venice and Florence in the Quattrocento and Cinquecento and the upshot is that these Italian city-states — the two maritime cities more than Florence — had developed many of the features that were to be found later on in the Netherlands, England and the United States. The importance of the early financial innovators has been eclipsed by the fact that these city-states did not survive politically. Instead, the innovations were absorbed in the long chain of financial evolution and, in the process, lost the identity of their creators.;2006;Italian city-states and financial evolution;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Fukao, Kyoji; MA, DEBIN; Yuan, Tangjun";"This article provides the first expenditure-based estimate of purchasing power parity (PPP) converters for 1934–1936 Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. We match all together 70–80 types of goods and services for private consumption, government expenditure and investment using three levels of weights derived from various expenditure surveys. We find that the 1934–1936 average prices of Korea for private consumption, investment, and government expenditure were about 0.86, 0.89, and 0.98 times that of Japan, respectively; and for Taiwan 0.84, 0.87, and 0.95, respectively. This gives the 1934–1936 Korea and Taiwan overall GDE average price levels of 0.87 and 0.86 that of Japan, respectively. Our new benchmark estimate is an improvement over existing converters based either on exchange rates or the 1990 backward projection method, which is embedded with index number biases.

Gazeley, Ian;This article examines the effect of total war on inequalities in pay in munitions industries in Britain during World War II. I present new data derived from Ministry of Labour monthly reports of changes in wage-rates, which allows for a systematic analysis of pay inequality by skill category and by gender and age. I also investigate changes in earnings equality using data derived from Earnings and Hours Enquiries and from records of the National Arbitration Tribunal. I conclude that pay differentials — defined by skill, gender or age — narrowed considerably during World War II. For men, the War represented an accentuation of a trend towards greater levelling that commenced in the later part of the 1930s and continued in the immediate postwar years. This was not the case for women workers. During the War years gender pay inequality in munitions industries was substantially reduced, but some of these gains were eroded with the coming of peace and demobilisation. Wartime labour policy was directed toward the deskilling of manufacturing work and this was coupled with both a significant expansion of unionisation (especially among unskilled workers) and institutional and legal changes that strengthened the bargaining position of trade unions. These factors suggest that institution factors worked in conjunction with labour demand effects to reduce pay inequality in those industries crucial for the war effort.;2006;The levelling of pay in Britain during the Second World War;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Guinnane, Timothy W.; Moehling, Carolyn M.; Ó Gráda, Cormac";"The relatively high marital fertility of the Irish in the United States in the 19th century has long been interpreted as evidence for the persistence of a distinctive Irish culture in the United States. This claim echoes a similar view of Irish-American marriage patterns. Recent work has shown that the marriage patterns of the Irish in the United States were similar to native-born whites with similar occupational and other characteristics. This paper studies the reasons for the high fertility of Irish-Americans in 1910. Irish-born women in that year had much larger families than the typical native-born woman, and little of the difference can be attributed to other characteristics. Second-generation Irishwomen were less distinctive in this regard, although even they differed from the natives primarily because of a different proclivity to have a large family. Our results signal the complexity of immigrant adjustment to a new environment; the Irish largely abandoned one aspect of Irish demographic behavior while clinging to another.";2006;The fertility of the Irish in the United States in 1910;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Although for this period it has been argued that income inequality declined, we reject our working hypothesis that height inequality declined in parallel with income inequality. In fact, height differences were low during the influenza/famine period of 1918–1920, and the Great Depression period. With the growing openness of the late 1920s, we observe a temporary rise in height inequality. The overall level of height inequality is lower than expected for Indian society that is influenced by a rigid caste system.;2006;The development and inequality of heights in North, West, and East India 1915–1944;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

And what can other measures of openness tell us about the growth process in the nineteenth century? This note offers some answers. The results can be summarised as follows: O'Rourke's primary finding is not altered by changes in the sample; incorporating measures of inter- and intranational market integration into the analysis again supports O'Rourke's findings, but apparently leaves no role for intranational market integration; and evidence from trade-flow data suggests that there may been a pro-growth role for tariffs in a non-reciprocal trade environment.";2006;New results on the tariff--growth paradox;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Kanazawa, Mark T.;This paper explores the development of water supplies by private ditch companies during the California Gold Rush. Using data taken from newspaper stories, mining camp by-laws, and state Supreme Court and district court cases, the paper documents the presence of institutional conditions that were unfavorable to support private water investments including property rights uncertainty, imperfect capital markets, and significant contractual enforcement costs that may have provided opportunities for contractual holdup by miners. Some evidence suggests that water development was likely discouraged to some extent. Nevertheless, the larger response was a major expansion in water supplies through an extensive ditch system, suggesting that there were factors that limited the ability of miners to capture rents, including various ditch company strategies to limit their exposure to opportunistic behavior and recognition by miners of their reliance on ditch companies.;2006;Investment in private water development: Property rights and contractual opportunism during the California Gold Rush;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Leuning, Timothy;This article assesses train speeds in England and Wales 1843–1912. Trains were fast compared with coaches or walking, and the social saving of time saved grew over time to become over 10 percent of national income in 1912. Including fare savings as well, social savings were 14 percent of national income in 1912, with consumer surplus of 6 percent. Time savings dominated fare savings once railways became a new good: travel for the masses.

"Lew, Byron; Cater, B.";The growth of trade after 1860 has been attributed to declining tariffs, to falling transport costs, and, recently, to monetary arrangements. However, coincident with the rise of trade the second half of the nineteenth century saw the development of the first electric communication network: the telegraph. The first successful trans-oceanic cable was operating in 1865. The telegraph remained the only direct trans-oceanic communication link until into the twentieth century. Little research has been conducted explicitly linking the impact of telegraphs on international shipping and international trade. A panel is used to show that there is a correlation between the diffusion of the telegraph, co-ordination of shipping, and the growth of world trade even controlling for the impact of other well-studied effects. The telegraph reduced the time ships spent in port and allowed ships to travel farther among ports to collect more valuable cargo.;2006;The telegraph, co-ordination of tramp shipping, and growth in world trade, 1870-1910;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Logan, Trevon D.;Economic historians hypothesize that households in the nineteenth century substituted away from carbohydrates and fiber and towards protein and fat as their incomes rose. Anthropometric historians assert that there was increased nutrient intake without any nutritional substitution. I test these hypotheses using the 1888 Cost of Living Survey. I fail to reject the hypothesis that the income elasticity of fiber is greater than or equal to the income elasticities of protein, fat, or sugar—contrary to the nutritional substitution posited by economic historians. A food modified Engel curve reveals that the shares of carbohydrates, fat, and sugar in the diet vary with household income, but the shares of protein and fiber do not. I do find, however, that the share of protein from animal sources increases with household income. I also find that the diets of late nineteenth century industrial workers were surprisingly balanced by modern standards.;2006;Food, nutrition, and substitution in the late nineteenth century;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Logan, Trevon D.;Using the 1888 Cost of Living Survey, I estimate the demand for calories of American and British industrial workers. I find that the income and expenditure elasticities of calories for American households are significantly lower than the corresponding elasticities for British households, suggesting that American industrial workers were nutritionally better off than their British counterparts. I further find that the calorie elasticity differential between the two countries was driven by the higher wages enjoyed in the United States. Additional analysis reveals that the relative price of calories was approximately 20 percent greater in Great Britain than in the United States.;2006;Nutrition and Well-Being in the Late Nineteenth Century;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
LONG, JASON;In this article I provide a micro-level analysis of primary schooling in Victorian England. Using a new dataset of school-age males linked between the 1851 and 1881 population censuses, I examine the determinants of childhood school attendance and the impact of attendance on adult labor market outcomes. I find that schooling had a positive effect on adult occupational class and that the associated wage gains were likely to have outweighed the cost of schooling. However, this effect was small relative to father's class, and the effect of education on earnings appears to have been small relative to modern results.;2006;The Socioeconomic Return to Primary Schooling in Victorian England;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"MAGEE, GARY B.; Thompson, Andrew S.";Britain of the nineteenth century was a net recipient of migrant remittances. Surprisingly little, however, is known about the flow of such funds to the UK. This article addresses this hiatus in several ways. First, it provides an account of the main mechanisms by which remittances were transferred in this period. Second, it presents new estimates of the volume of remittances flowing to Britain between 1875 and 1913, and, in doing so, offers a comparison of remittance patterns between different Anglophone societies. Third, it assesses the significance of remittances for their recipients in the UK. The article ends by considering the implications of all of the above for the way in which historians are currently trying to formulate the concept of a ?British world?.;2006;‘Lines of credit, debts of obligation’: migrant remittances to Britain, c.1875–1913;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"MAGEE, GARY B.; Thompson, Andrew S.";This article uses money order data to examine the determinants of British migrant remittances prior to 1914. Using panel data and cointegration analysis, it provides evidence of four distinct types of remittance behavior, lending support to Lucas and Stark's theory that remittances are driven by an implicit contract between remitter and remittee. The relative strengths of these different forms of remittance varied across the English-speaking world, with the largest differences occurring between migrants residing in America and those in the self-governing dominions. The explanation for these differences is seen to lie in the distinctive nature of British emigration to America.;2006;The Global and Local: Explaining Migrant Remittance Flows in the English-Speaking World, 1880–1914;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"MARKEVICH, ANDREI; Harrison, Mark";Monopoly is a particular problem in markets where experience goods are traded, since the consumer cannot respond to bad experiences by switching repeat purchases to another supplier. New evidence shows how the defence ministry as buyer in the Soviet market for military goods responded to this problem by investing in an evaluation of quality prior to purchase, by showing reluctance to buy, and by exploiting the available non-market means to influence the defence industry as supplier. The effectiveness of these stratagems was limited by the defence industry's counteractions and because the buyer had no choice but to come to a compromise with the supplier.;2006;Quality, experience, and monopoly: the Soviet market for weapons under Stalin;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"MARTINI, DINAH DUFFY; SILBERBERG, EUGENE";A substantial literature exists claiming the adoption of tractors was inefficiently slow. We develop a linear programming model of farms that specifically incorporates the opportunity cost of the farmer's time and apply it to farms in Iowa during the interwar period. We develop technological coefficients derived at the task level, based on the data and agricultural reports from that period. By valuing the time saved by tractors, we demonstrate that the seemingly slow rate of tractor adoption was in fact wealth maximizing. Tractors were widely adopted only after the improvement in implements that came late in this period.;2006;The Diffusion of Tractor Technology;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

McAvoy, Michael R.;The Reserve Board Organization Committee decision to locate 12 Federal Reserve Banks is reviewed. Probability choice models estimate a city’s selection probability for a Federal Reserve Bank location. Results of predicted selections show reserve cities were selected for their spatial economic characteristics, including information contained in bankers’ preferences, infrastructure development, population and recent National Banking System growth, rather than Democratic Party politics. The Reserve Board Organization Committee placed Federal Reserve Banks in preeminent financial and commercial centers, and relied upon bankers’ preferences for the remaining non-obvious selections. Given 12 cities were to be selected, the conclusion drawn is the decision was in the public interest.;2006;How were the Federal Reserve Bank locations selected?;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Miwa, Yoshiro; Ramseyer, J. Mark";In a series of recent studies, several economic historians (most prominently Richard Sylla) argue that successful economies experience “financial revolutions” before undergoing rapid growth. In the U.S., they suggest Hamilton masterminded the financial revolution by putting the public finance in order and facilitating private banks. Might Matsukata, they continue, have done the same in Japan? Japan did indeed experience a financial revolution in the late 19th century. Matsukata, however, did not mastermind the revolution in advance of private-sector demand. Instead, private investors created much of the financial infrastructure in response to demand from industrial firms. What is more, most firms (at least in the pivotal silk industry) raised the funds they needed through trade credit rather than securities markets or banks.;2006;Japanese industrial finance at the close of the 19th century: Trade credit and financial intermediation;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Neal, L.; Davis, L.";By 1914, the London Stock Exchange listed and traded one-third of the public capital available to investors anywhere in the world. No other exchange could match it in terms of scale and scope of securities on offer, or in terms of the number of stockbrokers available to potential customers. The reason, we argue, is that the microstructure of the London Stock Exchange was also unique. The owners of the exchange (Proprietors) left governance of the exchange to the users of the exchange (Members). Because the owners of the exchange could only increase revenue by increasing the number of users, newer members constantly sought new sources of revenue through financial innovations. The evolution of the London Stock Exchange's microstructure was path-dependent — the initial conditions for membership set the separate incentives for the owners and operators of the exchange, and these determined how they responded to successive shocks over time. Path dependency, unfortunately, eventually led to decreasing effectiveness and innovation by the members over time.;2006;The evolution of the structure and performance of the London Stock Exchange in the first global financial market, 1812-1914;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Ögren, Anders;During Sweden’s nineteenth-century modernization, Enskilda banks contributed to economic expansion and integration by providing generally accepted means of payment beyond what would have been possible for the central bank, the Riksbank. The Riksbank was constrained by specie-convertibility requirements for Sweden’s currency. Contrary to previous arguments, however, the Enskilda banks did not operate according to free banking theory. The Enskilda banks held Riksbank notes instead of specie as base-money reserves. This arrangement led to a higher supply of formal liquidity than what would have been the case with either a free banking system or a pure deposit-based commercial banking system. The consequence for Sweden was a rapid rate of monetization and financial deepening.;2006;Free or central banking?

OKAZAKI, TETSUJI;During the Second World War, the Japanese government and private sector searched for and implemented new mechanisms for coordination and motivation. One of these was sangyo hokokukai (sanpo). The Sanpo unit was basically an organization of the employer and employees of each firm, which held meetings to moderate labour relations. As a result of government policy to promote sanpo units, around 70 per cent of the total workers in Japan were organized into sanpo units in the early 1940s. As the members of trades unions and the workers of the companies that had factory committees were only 7 per cent and 5 per cent of the total workers in 1936 respectively, sanpo was the first large-scale mechanism for Japanese employees to have a voice. This article examines the role of sanpo, using prefecture-level and firm-level data, based on a framework integrating the ?voice view? of unionism and transaction cost economics. It was found that sanpo reduced the participation rate in labour disputes, and enhanced labour productivity at least for some of the time.;2006;‘Voice’ and ‘exit’ in Japanese firms during the Second World War: Sanpo revisited*;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

When prices increased landlords were encouraged to put more land under the plough. The estates? main income came, to an increasing extent, from demesne production, which finally dominated the income profile. The peasants? most important contribution to the landlords became, in most cases, their corvée labour, and their uncertain tenure rights were illustrated with great clarity in the continuing evictions, which were accelerated in the nineteenth century with the aim of expanding the demesne.;2006;Manorial economy and corvée labour in southern Sweden 1650–1850*;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
PAIVA ABREU, MARCELO de;Internal rates of return of Brazilian loans floated between 1824 and 1931 fell below those of British and US government consols and bonds only for some of the loans floated after the beginning of the twentieth century. Higher volatility of yearly rates of return was rewarded by higher returns for all Brazilian Federal loans. Their spreads over consols in 1824?1943 are compared to those of Argentina and Chile and of Brazilian state and municipal loans for 1888?1930. In spite of some deterioration over time, Brazilian loans had a better performance than suggested by the literature, especially in the 1920s.;2006;Brazil as a debtor, 1824–1931;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Pamuk, Sevket;This study provides, for the first time, an overview of the growth record of the Middle East since 1820 and inserts it into a comparative framework. GDP per capita estimates are offered for individual countries in the region for the benchmark years of 1913, 1870, and 1820. The Middle East began to participate in modern economic growth during the nineteenth century. Yet, per capita income differences with the high-income regions of the world widened considerably until World War I. In the twentieth century, the most important single factor contributing to increases in per capita incomes was oil.This is a subject about which we know little and where, in all likelihood, our knowledge will not grow greatly.Charles IssawiIssawi, Economic History of the Middle East, p. 103.;2006;Estimating Economic Growth in the Middle East since 1820;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The studies of the emergence of the gold standard have adopted variously long term and shorter term perspectives, and arrive at different conclusions concerning the relative contributions of technological and political factors. The histories of capital markets document the extent and sources of the openness of late nineteenth century capital markets, and reach conflicting conclusions on the role that the gold standard played in capital market integration.;2006;Recent contributions to the history of monetary and international financial systems: A review essay;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
RORKE, MARTIN;This article compares English and Scottish exports, from 1300?1600, using existing statistical data from England and a new data set of Scottish exports. It shows that the significant English and Scottish wool trades collapsed at almost identical rates. However, while England shifted towards exporting woollen cloth, a similar move in Scotland was weak?because of the poor quality of cloth and the urban form of the industry. In the second half of the sixteenth century, as English exports stagnated, Scottish trade began to grow, especially new and less-established commodities. This ?recovery? was based on the heavy depreciation of the Scottish currency.;2006;English and Scottish overseas trade, 1300–1600;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Sabaté, Marcela; Gadea, María Dolores; Escario, Regina";The Spanish peseta never formally belonged to the gold club, neither the classical nor the exchange-rate gold standards. It has been traditionally argued that the reason was the predominance of deficits in the Spanish budget from 1874 to 1935. The financing needs of the Treasury led to money creation and, consequently, to sacrificing the gold commitment and a fixed exchange rate. Applying a stationary VAR (Vector AutoRegressive) model, this paper estimates the dynamic link between budget and money and tests whether Spanish fiscal policy actually influenced monetary policy. The results confirm the dominance of fiscal policy for the period and, therefore, provide empirical support to the idea that the problems of the Treasury were behind Spain’s renouncement of gold.;2006;Does fiscal policy influence monetary policy?

Sgard, Jérôme;"Since the early 1997 paper by La Porta et al., a growing body of research has argued that ‘legal origins’ have a country-specific, time-invariant effect on property rights and economic development. Following the methodology of La Porta et al., an original database of 51 bankruptcy laws has been built: it ranges over 15 European countries and more than a hundred years (1808–1914), and summarises how the rights and incentives of the parties were defined as the procedures unfolded. The first conclusion is that, over the entire period, all legal traditions strongly protected creditors' rights; only English law comes out prima facie as less protective. Second, evidence suggests that the evolution of these laws was influenced less by their past than by continent-wide trends, arguably linked to capitalist development. An early nineteenth century model thus saw heavy repression of failed debtors and highly regulated judicial procedures. After a transition period from the late 1860s to the late 1880s, prison for debt was abandoned, rehabilitation became easier, and the parties were given much more room to recontract on property rights.";2006;Do legal origins matter?

Shambaugh, Jay C.;This paper finds that the combination of state regulated bank notes and deposits acting as the principal form of money and heterogeneous bank laws in the antebellum United States led to a loosely fixed exchange rate system where states were capable of exercising limited independent monetary policy.

Solar, Peter M.;The tonnage of shipping entering and leaving Ireland grew rapidly from the late eighteenth century until the mid-1870s, after which there was a distinct slowdown. The mid-nineteenth century was notable for a five-fold increase in shipping per capita, an indicator of the Irish economy?s increasing commercialization. The slowdown after 1870 would have been even greater without the industrial dynamism of Belfast, Ireland?s leading port from the 1880s. The early and rapid introduction of steamships from the 1820s made possible large-scale exports of live animals and fresh eggs, products that would account for 60 per cent of agricultural exports and a quarter of total exports by 1910.;2006;Shipping and economic development in nineteenth-century Ireland;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Stewart, James I.;I use a new data set of households linked between the 1860 and 1870 censuses to study frontier migration. Households that moved to the frontier to farm were more likely than non-migrants to have been poor, landless, and illiterate, and to have had young children. Also, after controlling for observable differences, migrants had below average abilities to accumulate wealth. These findings suggest fewer opportunities for migrants to accumulate wealth in non-frontier areas and a reason for their migration. Nonetheless, migrants fared well, accumulating wealth at high rates. The gains in wealth of migrants, especially those with long tenure on the frontier, suggest the extraordinary benefits of migration.;2006;Migration to the agricultural frontier and wealth accumulation, 1860–1870;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"STREB, JOCHEN; Baten, Jörg; YIN, SHUXI";We use a newly developed data set of 39,343 high-value patents granted between 1877 and 1918 to demonstrate that technological progress during German industrialization occurred in at least four different technological waves. We distinguish the railway wave (1877?86), the dye wave (1887?96), the chemical wave (1897?1902), and the wave of electrical engineering (1903?18). Evidence is presented that inter-industry knowledge spillovers between technologically, economically, and geographically related industries were a major source for innovative activities during German industrialization. We also show that technological change affected the geographical distribution of innovative regions. Using an index of technologically revealed comparative advantage we find that regions that increased their innovativeness during the waves of technological progress revealed special strength in technological clusters like electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, or chemicals.;2006;Technological and geographical knowledge spillover in the German empire 1877–1918;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Sutthiphisal, Dhanoos;This article investigates the impact of “learning-by-producing” on inventive activity. From 1870 to 1910, in both emerging (electrical equipment and supplies) and maturing (shoes and textiles) industries, the geographic association between invention and production was rather weak. Regional shifts in production did not lead to corresponding increases in invention. The location of inventive activity tended to mirror that of individuals with advanced technical skills appropriate to each industry. Consequently, scholars may have overemphasized the importance of learning-by-producing in accounting for geographic differences in inventive activity, and underestimated the significance of technical skills amongst the population.;2006;Learning-by-Producing and the Geographic Links Between Invention and Production: Experience from the Second Industrial Revolution;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Income elasticity of calories in 1901 was in the range of 0.3–0.6, varying inversely with the level income. Overall, our findings do not support the pessimists’ view, ubiquitous in the Italian literature.

Although the percentage of land in tenant plantations went down in the South during this period, it increased in some areas and decreased in others. In the areas where it increased, cotton production also increased. This result suggests that in some circumstances plantations had an advantage over small farms.;2006;Change in the plantation system: American South, 1910–1945;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Hence, the time needed for adjustment, following a violation of the bullion points, is a measure of integration. We apply this approach to exchange between fourteenth- and fifteenth-century Flanders, Lübeck, and Prussia, results showing that whereas it took about eight months to reduce deviations between Flanders and Lübeck by 50 percent, those between Flanders and Prussia were roughly twice as persistent.;2006;Estimating Financial Integration in the Middle Ages: What Can We Learn from a TAR Model?;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

WEBSTER, ANTHONY;This article explores the development of the London East India agency houses during the first half of the nineteenth century, and their evolving commercial and political relationships with merchants and manufacturers in the British provinces. It outlines the emergence of pressure groups in Britain concerned with influencing British economic policy in India and the Far East, and their role in shaping policy as the East India Company receded in importance following the Charter Acts of 1813 and 1833. What emerges is a complex picture of collaboration between interest groups in London and the provinces. This challenges and refines aspects of the gentlemanly capitalism thesis of Cain and Hopkins, which emphasizes both the supremacy of London-based financial and mercantile interests in the formation of British policy towards the empire, and the separateness of City-based ?gentlemanly capitalists? from provincial mercantile and industrial interests.;2006;The strategies and limits of gentlemanly capitalism: the London East India agency houses, provincial commercial interests, and the evolution of British economic policy in South and South East Asia 1800–50;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
WELSHMAN, JOHN;Current government policy documents have been concerned with reforming welfare policy, with matching rights with responsibilities, and especially with reducing the numbers of incapacity benefit claimants. This article places these debates in historical perspective, and revises the existing historiography on poverty and unemployment, by exploring the concept of the ?unemployable? in the period 1880?1940. Up to 1914, unemployability embraced those unable and those unwilling to work, and in the 1920s, similar anxieties were reconstructed in the concept of the ?social problem group?. However, interwar social surveys were concerned more with the effects of long-term unemployment in creating unemployability. There are thus both changes and continuities between historical concerns with unemployability, and contemporary anxieties about incapacity benefit and worklessness.;2006;The concept of the unemployable;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
WRIGLEY, E. A.;All organic economies were subject to constraints upon growth for reasons familiar to the classical economists, but their relative success in coping with these constraints differed substantially. This is visible both when comparing different areas at the same point in time and when comparing the circumstances of a given economy at different points in time. In this article the state of the English economy in 1300 is compared with its state in 1800. At the former date the balance between output and population was unfavourable. A run of poor harvests spelled grave and widespread suffering. Five hundred years later this had ceased to be true. The particular focus of the article is upon the significance of a rising level of productivity per head in agriculture, not simply in supplying food but in providing the raw materials and energy needed if industry and transport were to expand. In the circumstances of an organic economy both were heavily dependent upon the ?surplus? made available by a productive agriculture after meeting the needs of the population for food.;2006;The transition to an advanced organic economy: half a millennium of English agriculture;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Aldrich, Mark;Locomotive inspection was among the most important Progressive Era federal workplace regulations. Inspection rules were enforced by a new Bureau of Locomotive Inspection, which claimed credit for subsequent safety improvements. Relying on published and unpublished data this article assesses these claims. Literary sources suggest that the bureau achieved compliance by emphasizing regulatory benefits and that its activities sharply reduced locomotive defects through the 1920s, in part by reducing agency problems. A model for 1923–1932 reinforces this conclusion, but suggests that the safety gains came at high cost. After 1932 safety improvements stagnated, for inspection ran out of steam.;2007;Running Out of Steam: Federal Inspection and Locomotive Safety, 1912–1940;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Allen, Douglas W.;When George Carmack struck gold in the Yukon territory on 17 August 1896, he freely shared the details and started what would eventually be three waves of rushes. This reflected a social norm of the Klondike, namely that any miner who struck gold would share this information. Miners did not behave this way in other nineteenth-century gold rushes. The article's hypothesis is that the extreme mining conditions and local geography of the Yukon led to very secure property rights over mining claims. Therefore, it took only a small incentive payment to induce miners to act in the social interest.;2007;Information Sharing During the Klondike Gold Rush;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Alvarez-Nogal, Carlos; La Prados De Escosura, Leandro";This article attempts to quantify the decline of Spain over the period 1500–1850. In contrast to earlier estimates that focus almost exclusively on Castilian agriculture, we look at trends in urbanisation and construct new measures of agricultural and aggregate output at both regional and national levels. A distinctive long-run behaviour is found across Spanish regions that rejects the identification between Castile and Spain. Per capita income grew in the sixteenth and early nineteenth centuries, while contraction and stagnation occurred in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. In the long run, output per head did not improve until the early nineteenth century. At the time of its imperial expansion Spain was a relatively affluent nation and, by 1590, was only behind the Low Countries and Italy in terms of per capita income.

Its organization and incentive structures differed importantly from contemporaneous private sailing ventures, but closely resembled those of today’s large corporations. To induce efficient effort, the navy used a hierarchical tournament, in which sailors competed for higher pay that came with promotions based on relative performance. Promotion probabilities, the option value of future promotions, and the higher effort required of men in higher ranks and on larger vessels, combined to yield a highly skewed pay structure.;2007;Organization and incentives in the age of sail;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Benjamin, Daniel K.; Tifrea, Anca";Between 1660 and 1815 the combat fatality rate among British navy captains fell by 98 percent, even as the combat success of the British Navy rose dramatically. Both developments can be explained as a result of learning by doing among British commanders. This learning was importantly driven by the extensive wartime experience accumulated over this period, combined with the unparalleled financial incentives for combat success offered to British commanders.;2007;Learning by Dying: Combat Performance in the Age of Sail;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Bodenhorn, Howard;Few pieces of economic regulation are ubiquitous as usury limits. Similarly, few economic principles are as widely accepted as the belief that interference with freely contracted prices leads to market distortions, and many studies of financial markets find that usury limits negatively affect credit availability. This study shows that when no regulatory authority monitors and stands ready to punish violators of the usury limit when intermediaries and borrowers form long-term relationships, banks and borrowers regularly contract for interest rates in excess of the usury ceiling. Time-series analysis reveals limited effects on credit availability when market rates exceed the usury ceiling. Cross-sectional analysis of individual loan contracts also shows that the positive effect of a long-term relationship offsets the negative effect of the usury limit on credit availability.;2007;Usury ceilings and bank lending behavior: Evidence from nineteenth century New York;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
BOOTH, ANNE;The article examines aspects of government policy in different parts of colonial south-east Asia, and in nominally independent Siam (Thailand) in the first four decades of the twentieth century. The emphasis is on taxation and expenditure policies, and their implications for the development of infrastructure and also for the welfare of indigenous populations. Attention is also given to the impact of government regulation of both factor and product markets. On the basis of the empirical evidence, the article argues that the traditional view of the colonial state as a ?night watchman? was not applicable to most parts of south-east Asia after 1900. Governments were increasingly involved in implementing policies that today would be considered developmental, including building infrastructure and improving access to secular education and modern health care for the indigenous populations. But given the resources that they had, or had the potential to mobilize, more could have been achieved.;2007;Night watchman, extractive, or developmental states?

The reason for the immediate postwar inflation was then not mismanaged policy but a wise choice in the French context; nevertheless, a stabilisation was historically possible from early 1924, and it would most likely have benefited not only France but the entire international monetary system.";2007;Why didn't France follow the British stabilisation after World War I?;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Broadberry, Stephen N.; Burhop, Carsten";This article provides a new benchmark estimate of comparative Germany/U.K. labor productivity in manufacturing for circa 1907, and experiments with alternative German manufacturing production indices for time series projection from a circa 1935 benchmark. A consistent picture of broadly similar levels of manufacturing labor productivity in Britain and Germany throughout the period 1871–1938 is established. We also show that a substantial German productivity lead had already emerged in heavy industry by 1907, but was offset by a substantial British productivity lead in light industry. For the pre-1914 period, an additional check is provided using nominal income-based estimates.;2007;Comparative Productivity in British and German Manufacturing Before World War II: Reconciling Direct Benchmark Estimates and Time Series Projections;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Brown, John C.; Guinnane, Timothy W.";Much empirical social-science research, including work in economic and demographic history, has relied on the analysis of published information on administrative districts. One famous example of this type of research, the Princeton Project on the Decline of Fertility in Europe (EFP), was carried out at Princeton University?s Office of Population Research in the 1960s and 1970s. This project aimed to characterize the decline of fertility that took place in Europe during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The project?s summary statements argued that social and economic forces played little role in bringing about the fertility transition. A central feature of the EFP argument is a series of statistical exercises which purport to show that changes in economic and social conditions exerted little influence on fertility. Two recent articles on Germany for this period have used similar data and methods to draw different conclusions. We show that the difference reflects problems in the Princeton project?s statistical methods. Those problems affect, potentially, virtually all quantitative research of this type. Our findings suggest cautious re-thinking of conclusions based on this type of evidence, starting with the EFP.;2007;Regions and time in the European fertility transition: problems in the Princeton Project’s statistical methodology;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
BROWNLOW, GRAHAM;Northern Ireland?s economic performance during the ?golden age? was weak. Crafts suggested that rent-seeking was an important determinant of this poor record. This article offers support for such a conclusion. It is suggested that the growth record was shaped by British regulations preventing conflicts of ministerial interest not being made operational until 1963. This institutional divergence tended to promote rent-seeking behaviour, which impeded the pursuit of an industrial policy that could promote economic efficiency. In 1963 the institutional structure and the industrial policy framework changed. These changes stimulated the pursuit of efficiency and contributed to an improved regional economic performance.;2007;The causes and consequences of rent-seeking in Northern Ireland, 1945–72;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

It explains the pattern of use by supply and demand factors, and develops a new method to estimate the overall impact on wheat yields.

Calvo-Gonzalez, Oscar;The security of property rights is fragile under dictatorships. This is particularly so if economic agents are uncertain as to whether the regime will last. As a result, private investment is withheld and economic performance is poor. Spain was in such a situation after World War II. However, as the Cold War intensified the United States became interested in Spain as a military ally, thereby helping to consolidate Franco's regime. This led to an increase in economic confidence and helps to explain why economic growth resumed in Spain ahead of significant changes in its autarkic economic policies.;2007;American Military Interests and Economic Confidence in Spain under the Franco Dictatorship;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Caruana, Leonard; Rockoff, Hugh";"During World War II the Allies controlled Spain's oil supply in order to limit Spain's support for the Axis. This experiment with sanctions is unusually informative because a wide range of policies was tried over a long period. Three episodes are of special interest: (1) a total embargo on oil for Spain in August 1940 that was surprisingly successful in dissuading Spain from joining the Axis; (2) a period of reduced supplies in 1941–42, which we call ‘the Squeeze’, that was only partially successful in reversing Spanish policies favouring the Axis; and (3) a second total embargo early in 1944, which proved a disappointment for the Allies, and that produced a rift between Churchill and Roosevelt. Our analysis is based on new monthly estimates of Spain's imports of gasoline and other petroleum products that we describe in the text and report in the Appendix.

These indicate a strong four-year cycle, derived from the agricultural sector, which curiously (and perhaps spuriously) vanishes after 30 years. Over the longer term GDP and the services reflect the long swing in industrial production, tied to the investment cycle.

Clark, Gregory;The article forms three series for English farm workers from 1209?1869: nominal day wages, the implied marginal product of a day of farm labour, and the purchasing power of a day?s wage in terms of farm workers? consumption. These series suggest that labour productivity in English agriculture was already high in the middle ages. Furthermore, they fit well with one method of estimating medieval population that suggests a peak English population c.1300 of nearly 6 million. Lastly, they imply that both agricultural technology and the general efficiency of the economy were static from 1250 till 1600. Economic changes were in these years entirely a product of demographic shifts. From 1600 to 1800, technological advance in agriculture provided an alternative source of dynamism in the English economy.;2007;The long march of history: Farm wages, population, and economic growth, England 1209–1869;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Clark, Gregory; Jacks, David S.";How important was coal to the Industrial Revolution? Despite the huge growth of output, and the grip of coal and steam on the popular image of the Industrial Revolution, recent cliometric accounts have assumed coalmining mattered little to the Industrial Revolution. In contrast both E. A. Wrigley and Kenneth Pomeranz have made coal central to the story. This article constructs new series on coal rents, the price of coal at pithead and at market, and the price of firewood, and uses them to examine this issue. We conclude coal output expanded in the Industrial Revolution mainly as a result of increased demand rather than technological innovations in mining. But that expansion could have occurred at any time before 1760. Further, our coal rents series suggests that English possession of coal reserves made a negligible contribution to Industrial Revolution incomes.;2007;Coal and the Industrial Revolution, 1700-1869;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
COHN, JR, SAMUEL;The Black Death spurred monarchies and city-states across much of Western Europe to formulate new wage and price legislation. These legislative acts splintered in a multitude of directions that to date defy any obvious patterns of economic or political rationality. A comparison of labour laws in England, France, Provence, Aragon, Castile, the Low Countries, and the city-states of Italy shows that these laws did not flow logically from new post-plague demographics and economics?the realities of the supply and demand for labour. Instead, the new municipal and royal efforts to control labour and artisans? prices emerged from fears of the greed and supposed new powers of subaltern classes and are better understood in the contexts of anxiety that sprung forth from the Black Death?s new horrors of mass mortality and destruction, resulting in social behaviour such as the flagellant movement and the persecution of Jews, Catalans, and beggars.;2007;After the Black Death: labour legislation and attitudes towards labour in late-medieval western Europe;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Coleman, Andrew;This paper argues that bilateral spatial price models do not estimate bilateral transactions costs when trade with third cities is important. The paper examines trans-Atlantic gold arbitrage during the gold standard era by assembling a database indicating when trans-Atlantic gold shipments occurred. It shows that two-way gold shipments between New York and London frequently occurred prior to 1901. However, in 1901 gold shipments to London ceased and were replaced by triangular arbitrage shipments through Paris. Consequently, New York and London gold price data cannot be used to estimate New York–London transactions costs after 1901, as no trade took place.;2007;The pitfalls of estimating transactions costs from price data: Evidence from trans-Atlantic gold-point arbitrage, 1886–1905;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Colistete, Renato P.;After World War II Brazil experienced exceptionally high economic growth, ranking tenth among the largest economies by 1960. Yet evidence shows that real wages lagged far behind productivity, especially from 1956, the heyday of “developmentalism”—an economic ideology aimed at state-led, accelerated industrialization, with foreign and domestic private capital as active partners. The outcome diverged from that of the “social compact for growth,” the cornerstone of the “golden age” in Europe and Japan. A key reason was that in Brazil left-wingers controlled the main trade unions and pushed an agenda of social reform that was widely rejected by industrialists.;2007;Productivity, Wages, and Labor Politics in Brazil, 1945–1962;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Collins, William J.; Margo, Robert A.";In the 1960s many American cities experienced violent, race-related civil disturbances. This article examines census data from 1950 to 1980 to measure the riots' impact on the value of central-city residential property, and especially on black-owned property. Both OLS and IV estimates indicate that the riots depressed the median value of black-owned property between 1960 and 1970, with little or no rebound in the 1970s. Census tract data for a small number of cities suggest relative losses of population and property value in tracts that were directly affected by riots compared to other tracts in the same cities.;2007;The Economic Aftermath of the 1960s Riots in American Cities: Evidence from Property Values;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Collins, William J.; Smith, Fred H.";We undertake a case study of riots in the context of Cleveland’s economic decline between 1950 and 1980. Our empirical perspective emphasizes differential changes in property values and population levels across census tracts depending on their proximity to the riots’ epicenter. We find patterns that are consistent with concentrated, negative, and long-lasting effects from the 1960s riots. The negative relationship between riots and property value trends is not merely a reflection of the pre-existing trend in value, the pre-riot racial composition of the neighborhoods, the pre-riot proportion of neighborhood residents holding manufacturing jobs, the neighborhood crime rate, nor changes in the observable characteristics of the housing stock. We suggest that the impact of the riots was compounded by long-run forces that were already eroding Cleveland’s economic base.;2007;A neighborhood-level view of riots, property values, and population loss: Cleveland 1950–1980;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

We find a slowdown in TFP growth between 1850 and 1870, after which it stabilized at about 1.1%. An analysis of company-level productivity performance reveals large discrepancies in TFP growth and substantial cost inefficiency. The evidence suggests that there was managerial failure in companies with agency problems in a context of collusion and high entry barriers. A wider implication is that the neoclassical exoneration of late-Victorian British management may be less convincing for the services sector than for manufacturing.;2007;Total factor productivity growth on Britain’s railways, 1852–1912: A reappraisal of the evidence;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Cuenca-Esteban, Javier;The East India Company’s “regulated” trade monopoly more effectively served Britain’s national interest during the French wars than might be inferred from contemporary complaints and recent scholarship. The Board of Control’s assessment of India’s importance to the British balance of payments in the 1780s was well informed and was borne out by subsequent developments. British net inflows from India remained substantial through 1765–1812 and were arguably least dispensable. British trade with Asia most frequently outgrew the worldwide totals and retained some of the acquired gains to the end of the period. The real constraints faced by private traders should be weighed against the external economies and scale advantages rendered by the East India Company to a wider range of British interests.;2007;India’s contribution to the British balance of payments, 1757–1812;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
David, Paul A.;This introduction to the concept of path dependence, its pertinence for the development of historical social science, and its application in economic analysis and economic history, proceeds from intuitive general ideas about history and historicity in narratives. It provides precise definitions of what is meant by describing a dynamical process as being “historical.” Deterministic and stochastic formalizations of such dynamical systems are distinguished. The characterization of stochastic path dependent processes as “non-ergodic” is explained in non-mathematical language by reference to concepts in probability theory, and a variety of representations of such processes in formal models is surveyed (including the Polya urn-process, certain kinds of Markov chain models, branching processes, and reversible spin systems) to show that while all display path dependence, their properties in other respects are quite different. The diverse set of structural, micro-level conditions that can give rise to path dependence is examined, and a further distinction is drawn between the property of path dependence and the existence of so-called “QWERTY-effects”—characterized by decentralized competitive market failures and consequent “lock-in” to Pareto-inefficient equilibria. Concluding sections consider the implications of the existence of non-ergodic dynamics for the methods of economic policy analysis, and the nature of the guidance that can be obtained in regard to public policy affecting endogenous technological change and institutional evolution.;2007;Path dependence: a foundational concept for historical social science;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Demeulemeester, Jean-Luc; Diebolt, Claude";Is cliometrics a discipline that could help economists to close the gap between theory and empirical analysis? For many authors, and certainly many of its protagonists, cliometrics appears to be first of all a new branch of history, using economic theories, tools and techniques to provide answers mainly to historiographical debates and not so much to economic debates per se. Could nevertheless this discipline help economists to come closer to physics by enabling them to discover true laws in economics? More modestly some recent work in cliometrics performed by economists (stricto sensu) reveals the possibility of cliometrics to be an auxiliary discipline of economics (and not solely of history). As such, it should form part of the basic toolkit of all properly educated economists. In this paper we give a survey on the key methodological issue of existence (and type) of laws in economics and the proper role that could be assigned to cliometrics to best serve the development of economics in this perspective.;2007;How much could economics gain from history: the contribution of cliometrics;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

This article examines this view using evidence from pre-Emancipation Bohemia and Russia. It finds that serf communes generated a substantial ?social capital? of shared norms, common information, and collective sanctions. But communal social capital was manipulated by village elites who collaborated with overlords in taxation, land regulation, and demographic control. This benefited communal oligarchies, but harmed ordinary serfs and the wider economy. Horizontal social capital and vertical hierarchies, the article demonstrates, can as easily collude as conflict.;2007;Serfdom and social capital in Bohemia and Russia;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
DOMENECH, JORDI;This paper studies the decline of the working day in Spain from 1885 to 1920. The decline was more continuous than previously thought. Differences in hours reinforce wage differentials, showing labor markets were not well integrated. Cross-sectional and time-series analysis suggests that hour reductions reflect a labor supply rather than a labor demand effect. Given the comparatively slow growth of real wages in Spain from 1870 to 1920, the Spanish case shows that international convergence in hours of work must have been stronger than convergence in wages.;2007;Working hours in the European periphery: The length of the working day in Spain, 1885–1920;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

DUPONT, BRANDON;Contagious bank runs, which spread to both solvent and insolvent banks, should not occur if bank-specific information is provided regularly to the banking public. By mitigating the information asymmetry between banks and depositors, information should restrict runs to insolvent banks. However, official bank statements collected from quarterly reports to local newspapers in Kansas demonstrate that runs did become contagious in the 1893 panic even in an information-rich banking system. Important differences between national and non-national banks were also found, which suggests the maturity of the regulatory system may have played an important role in the panic.;2007;Bank runs, information and contagion in the panic of 1893;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Eckard, E. Woodrow;This paper studies a unique 1901 data set containing prices of three products obtained from grocery stores in over 1400 cities nationwide. A striking characteristic is a high concentration of retail prices at relatively few “even” numbers. I propose a novel transactions cost explanation for this phenomenon on which existing theory is silent. In particular, grocers selected prices that simplified the task of toting up customer bills by hand and reduced related costs. As stores independently adopted this strategy across the country, prices converged to a few even numbers. Several empirical regularities for all three products are consistent with this explanation. An important implication is that preferences for computationally convenient prices would have made prices “sticky.” An independent study of price flexibility circa 1890 supports this hypothesis. The underlying data show price concentration patterns similar to the 1901 data, suggesting that the phenomenon covered a wide range of products.;2007;Retail price concentration, transaction costs, and price flexibility circa 1900;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Eichengreen, Barry; Hatase, Mariko";We analyze the impact of Japan’s exit from its currency peg in 1971. We identify sizeable effects on Japanese exports and investment but find that the negative impacts on the economy were neutralized by strong global demand and domestic fiscal support. While our analysis suggests that a rapidly-growing, export-oriented economy can exit a peg for a managed float despite the presence of capital controls and the absence of sophisticated foreign currency forward markets, it underscores the importance of exiting while global conditions are favorable and points to the importance of using fiscal policy to support domestic demand as the rise in the real exchange rate slows the growth of net exports and investment.;2007;Can a rapidly growing export-oriented economy exit smoothly from a currency peg?

Eloranta, J.;The purpose of this article is to re-evaluate the military spending dynamics leading to the First World War, namely to explore the impact of the declining military and economic leadership of the UK and the economic emergence of the USA. Individual countries responded to threats from perceived enemies and spillovers from potential allies rationally, yet often going beyond the bounds of traditional alliances. In a sixteen-country system, the military reticence of the UK and USA encouraged higher military spending by other states, which suggests that Germany was not responsible for the arms race alone.

"Epstein, Philip; HOWLETT, PETER; Schulze, Max-Stephan";This paper investigates the evidence for convergence in per capita incomes across 115 economies during the period 1950–1998 and examines the impact that international trade had on this process. Drawing on trade-conditioning within a distribution dynamics framework, that explicitly models frequency distributions of the cross sections of economies over time, this study suggests that trade patterns in the Golden Age were conducive to the formation of middle and high income groups or clubs of economies, but similar trade patterns (dominated by the rich economies) do not seem to explain the perpetuation of these group formations in the post-Golden Age period. If foreign trade is a key aspect of globalisation, why does it matter in accounting for the observed dynamics of the international income distribution during the Golden Age, but not during the decades since the first oil-shock? Further, the evidence from the ergodic (long-run equilibrium) distribution suggests that in the long term the established trade patterns favoured the growth of the rich at the expense of the poor economies across the world.;2007;Trade, convergence, and globalisation: The dynamics of the international income distribution, 1950–1998;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Field, Alexander J.;A consideration of TFP growth in the United States during the golden age (1948–1973) raises two related questions: on the one hand why was it so strong and on the other hand, why were TFP growth rates lower than they were during the Depression years (1929–1941)? A continuing downward trend in TFP growth within manufacturing, and its declining share after World War II, provide answers to the latter question. A persisting productivity windfall associated with the build out of the surface road infrastructure helps answer the former question. By adopting a longer historical perspective, we can move beyond understanding the golden age sui generis, and begin to see it instead as a period reflecting the persistence of trends and developments whose origins are to be found prior to the Second World War.;2007;The origins of US total factor productivity growth in the golden age;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

For the largest players, the US and UK, benefits from foreign cooperation were small or negative. France and Germany would have been the principal beneficiaries of international cooperative policies. Since cooperation on one issue, tariffs, was difficult, cooperation on many — through the cross-issue bargaining attempted at the 1933 London Conference- was well nigh impossible. Optimum coordination across policy instruments within one country, on the other hand, would have yielded high returns for policy. A corollary is that lack of internal coordination (poor domestic policies) was a more important cause of the Great Depression than failure to harmonise policies internationally.;2007;Trade wars and the Slump;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Gottlieb, Daniel;Between 1880 and 1930, cooperative insurance was the main source of illness, accident, and death insurance in the United States, Canada, and England. This paper tests for asymmetric information in cooperative insurance societies and examines how their pricing policies affected the profile of members. We find strong evidence that, unlike their modern substitutes, cooperative societies were able to overcome the asymmetry of information. Furthermore, as a consequence of non-actuarial pricing, our results suggest that workers deferred their membership until they were about 40 years old.;2007;Asymmetric information in late 19th century cooperative insurance societies;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Greenwood, Michael J.;Using panel data on 12 European source countries that are followed for 26 years (1873–1898), this paper studies age-specific emigration rates and the age composition of U.S. immigration. Two age groups are the focus of attention, 15–40 and over 40. Emigration-rate models and compositional models that satisfy adding-up conditions are estimated by the Hausman–Taylor Instrumental Variable approach. Younger migrants responded more strongly to job opportunities than to wage differentials, whereas older migrants responded more strongly to wage differentials. Both age groups tended to follow recent past migrants to the U.S. Relatively many younger (and relatively fewer older) migrants came from countries with higher percentages of their work forces in agriculture. Higher source-country birthrates discouraged younger migrants, presumably by raising the cost of family migration.;2007;Modeling the age and age composition of late 19th century U.S. immigrants from Europe;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Grossman, Richard S.;This paper examines the pattern and timing of the enactment of double liability for state banks in the United States prior to the Great Depression. Under double liability, shareholders of failing banks could lose, in addition to the initial purchase price of shares, an amount equal to the par value of shares owned. The results suggest that double liability was adopted by states subject to greater economic risks, where bank failures were more likely, or where the economy and banking sector were more advanced and bank failures would be more costly (i.e., fear), and that single liability was adopted by more rapidly growing states, where the payoff to greater risk-taking was higher (i.e., greed).;2007;Fear and greed: The evolution of double liability in American banking, 1865–1930;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Hart, Robert A.;Extreme demand pressures coupled with acute skill shortages in the run up to World War II caused British engineering companies to break down existing production processes into smaller constituent parts. This allowed the employment of persons trained over narrower ranges of skills and helped to create an exponential growth of female jobs, from 10.5% of total engineering employment in 1939 to 35.2% by 1943. Women were officially classified into those doing men’s work and those doing women’s work. Using a unique data set provided by the Engineering Employers Federation, this paper examines female work and pay from 1935 (the first year of rearmament) to 1942 (the peak of production activity) in more detail than has been previously undertaken. It features the pay and hours of piece- and time-rated women, female–male wage ratios, and an assessment of the war’s longer term impact on the female labor market.;2007;Women doing men’s work and women doing women’s work: Female work and pay in British wartime engineering;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Heckelman, Jac C.; Dougherty, Keith L.";Empirical studies of delegate voting at the Constitutional Convention have relied on the same 16 roll call votes. This article re-examines various assumptions used in the collection of these data. We first create a baseline regression. We then consider the effect of dropping delegates not in attendance, re-inferring the votes from primary sources, examining various subsamples of the roll calls, and reconstructing constituency variables to include state districts. Our findings suggest that personal interests were indeed important for decision making at the Constitutional Convention, but constituent interests were less important than previously claimed.;2007;An Economic Interpretation of the Constitutional Convention of 1787 Revisited;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Heinemeyer, Hans Christian;This paper investigates the impact of changes in national border demarcation on economic integration. It treats the national breakups in Central Europe due to WWI as a natural experiment. The set-up allows to control for selection bias when estimating the impact of national borders on trade. A gravity model of trade is used to analyze goods-specific trade among Central European regions. The main results are, first, that systematic deviations of the observations under “border treatment” are found. Regions pairs that became separated by a new national border after WWI, tended to have below average levels of economic integration already before the war. A comparison of actual and biased result for goods-specific trade yields a difference of between 21 and 86% ad-valorem tariff equivalent, and might well be higher for certain goods. Second, the analysis indicates that cross-border integration was indeed lower after WWI but that this change was economically significant only for certain sectors. Third, in the interwar period, international trade was less diverted by borders first established after the war than by borders existing already before WWI. The results stress the importance of relative barriers to trade in attenuating the adverse effects of WWI on economic integration.;2007;The treatment effect of borders on trade.

Herranz-Loncán, Alfonso;This paper analyzes the impact of infrastructure investment on Spanish economic growth between 1850 and 1935. Using new infrastructure data and VAR techniques, this paper shows that the growth impact of local-scope infrastructure investment was positive, but returns to investment in large nation-wide networks were not significantly different from zero. Two complementary explanations are suggested for the last result. On the one hand, public intervention and the application of non-efficiency investment criteria were very intense in large network construction. On the other hand, returns to new investment in large networks might have decreased dramatically once the basic links were constructed.;2007;Infrastructure investment and Spanish economic growth, 1850–1935;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Hilt, Eric;This article analyzes the connection between investment decisions and financing arrangements in the nineteenth-century American whaling industry. Managers of whaling ventures shared their risks by selling some equity claims but retained a substantial portion due to moral hazard considerations. As a result, they had little incentive to consider the covariance between their own returns, and those of others, in planning their voyages. This stifled diversity in whaling voyages and increased industry-wide risk. The analysis suggests a link between financial market development, or the extent of risk sharing in financial markets, and the range of economic activities pursued.;2007;Investment and Diversification in the American Whaling Industry;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Hogerzeil, Simon J.; RICHARDSON, DAVID";The mortality of enslaved Africans in the Atlantic crossing has long preoccupied historians but the relationship between slave traders' purchasing strategies and slave mortality rates in transit has escaped close investigation. We address these issues by using records of 39 eighteenth-century voyages of the Dutch Middelburgsche Commercie Compagnie. These allow shipboard mortality rates of enslaved Africans to be estimated. They also reveal previously un-noticed age- and gender-based variations in slave purchase and mortality patterns, which in turn shed light on the relative importance of African and shipboard conditions in determining slave survival rates in the middle passage.;2007;Slave Purchasing Strategies and Shipboard Mortality: Day-to-Day Evidence from the Dutch African Trade, 1751–1797;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

I estimate the risk of contracting malarial fevers in the 1850s by using correlations between malaria and environmental factors such as climate and geographical features. The study demonstrates that Union Army recruits who spent their early years in malaria-endemic counties were 1.1 inches shorter at enlistment due to malnutrition and were 13 percent more susceptible to infections during the U.S. Civil War as a result of immune disorders than were those from malaria-free regions.;2007;The Burden of Early Exposure to Malaria in the United States, 1850–1860: Malnutrition and Immune Disorders;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

We contest the popular view that the divergence in worktimes between Europe and North America and Australia is a recent phenomenon. Since 1870 the decline in weekly and annual hours was consistently greater in the Old World; the New World has had fewer days off for the last 130years. Labor power and inequality, held to be important determinants of worktime after 1970, had comparable effects in the period before 1913.

Irwin, Douglas A.;In the late nineteenth century, the United States imposed high tariffs to protect domestic manufacturers from foreign competition. This article examines the magnitude of protection given to import-competing producers and the costs imposed on export-oriented producers by focusing on changes in the domestic prices of traded goods relative to nontraded goods. The results suggest that the 30 percent average import tariff gave about a 17 percent implicit subsidy to import-competing producers and effectively taxed exporters at about 10 percent. Tariffs redistributed large amounts of income (about 8 percent of GDP), but the effect on consumers was roughly neutral.;2007;Tariff Incidence in America's Gilded Age;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Jacks, David S.;In this paper, the divergence between popular and professional opinion on speculation in general and futures markets in particular is explored. Along the way, a synopsis of prevailing popular attitudes on futures markets is presented, and an outline of a formal model of futures markets and its implications for commodity price volatility are sketched. The heart of the analysis is drawn from the historical record on the establishment and prohibition of futures markets. Briefly, the results presented in this paper strongly suggest that futures markets were associated with—and most likely caused—lower commodity price volatility. The paper concludes with a discussion of potential sources of popular antagonism against futures markets.;2007;Populists versus theorists: Futures markets and the volatility of prices;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"James, John A.; Thomas, Mark";In this paper we employ microeconomic evidence on the unemployment experiences of American males to evaluate the sensitivity of unemployment to business cycle fluctuations in the late nineteenth century as compared to the mid-twentieth century. Our results indicate a substantial decline in the value of the Okun coefficient (from −0.65 to −0.32) between the 1890s and the 1960s. These findings challenge Christina Romer’s interpretation that the measured decline in cyclical volatility of unemployment over the twentieth century was created by improvements in the statistical record. Rather, it was changes in the underlying dynamics of the labor market over the cycle, most notably the transition to procyclical productivity patterns and the shift from an added to a discouraged worker effect among secondary workers, which may be summarized as the development of modern labor market behavior, that account for the declining cyclical sensitivity of employment and the drop in the cyclical volatility of unemployment over the century.;2007;Romer revisited: long-term changes in the cyclical sensitivity of unemployment;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Empirical evidence indicates that the exploitation of Canada's natural resource endowment made direct and indirect contributions to the size and efficiency of the twentieth-century domestic economy. I conclude that the concentration of capital and labor in resource industries did not constrain the rate of change of Canadian real GNP per capita between 1900 and 1999, and it appears to have had a substantial positive impact on the level of real GNP per capita.;2007;The Engine or the Caboose?

"KESSLER, DAVID; Temin, Peter";Rome was an exceedingly large city at the start of the Roman Empire, and it required massive grain imports to feed its population. We argue that Roman merchants organized these imports and that they used a variety of mechanisms to deal with the informational problems of long-distance trade at that time. They used general institutions of Rome, such as its legal and social structures, as well as specific mercantile institutions, such as contracts, companies, and invoices. They exploited information in the Roman social structure as well as in the facilities for trade. This combination of social and economic institutions enabled Roman merchants to operate on as large a scale as any other pre-industrial merchant group.;2007;The organization of the grain trade in the early Roman Empire;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Komlos, John;We examine secular trends in biological well-being in the Habsburg Monarchy circa 1850–1910 on the basis of evidence on the physical stature of recruits disaggregated at the regional level. We find that heights stagnated generally among the 1850s birth cohorts. The secular increase in heights that lasted until the twenty-first century began among the 1860s birth cohorts. Men born in the more developed Czech and Austria areas were as tall as many populations in Western Europe, whereas the men born in the Polish/Ukrainian provinces were about as tall as the Mediterranean populations. There was a 3.3 cm gap between the heights of men living in the core versus periphery of the Monarchy, which reflects a substantial gap in biological living standards. We also consider spatial convergence of biological living standards. Heights did not converge across the different provinces of the Monarchy at all in the 1850s, diverged in the 1860s, and began to converge subsequently. Convergence was more rapid among those born in the 1880s than among the cohorts of the 1870s, even though the average rate of increase in heights was greater in the 1870s than in the 1880s. The convergence was limited to the peripheral regions (Polish/Ukrainian, Romanian, and Slovakian). No convergence was evident among the Austrian, Czech, Hungarian or Croatian areas. By the end of the period under consideration the gap between Austrian and Polish/Ukrainian heights was reduced to 1.5 cm. The evidence on heights is quite similar to the evidence on GDP growth insofar as it points to some positive elements but is by no means uniformly favorable. The Monarchy was not stagnating, or about to collapse on the eve of World War I on account of economic considerations as the Soviet Union did, but it was also not among the high-achievers of the era as the Scandinavian countries or Germany.;2007;Anthropometric evidence on economic growth, biological well-being and regional convergence in the Habsburg Monarchy, c. 1850–1910;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Landon-Lane, John S.; Rockoff, Hugh";This paper is about the behavior of regional interest rates in the United States from 1880 to 2002. The main concern is with the shocks to regional rates. Where did they originate? How did they diffuse? How did the pattern change over time? We show that in the late nineteenth century the main source of shocks to rates on the periphery were shocks originating on the periphery itself. This pattern continued through World War I and the Great Depression. After World War II, however, the importance of disturbances on the periphery diminished and shocks to rates in the Eastern financial centers became the main source of fluctuations in all regions.;2007;The origin and diffusion of shocks to regional interest rates in the United States, 1880–2002;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Lee, Chulhee;Although the Civil War has attracted a great deal of scholarly attention, little is known about how different wartime experiences of soldiers influenced their civilian lives after the war. This paper examines how military rank and duty of Union Army soldiers while in service affected their post-service occupational mobility. Higher ranks and non-infantry duties appear to have provided more opportunities for developing skills, especially those required for white-collar jobs. Among the recruits who were unskilled workers at the time of enlistment, commissioned and non-commissioned officers were much more likely to move up to a white-collar job by 1880. Similarly, unskilled recruits assigned to white-collar military duties were more likely to enter a white-collar occupation by 1880. The higher occupational mobility of higher-ranking soldiers is likely to have resulted from disparate human capital accumulations offered by their military positions rather than from their superior abilities.;2007;Military positions and post-service occupational mobility of Union Army veterans, 1861–1880;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The estimated value of the property is much higher than was reported by the United Nations Conciliation Commission in 1951.

Libecap, Gary D.;I examine the assignment of private property rights during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries to five natural resources on federal lands in the Far West. Assigning property rights required adaptation from established, eastern practices. The resulting property rights and their long-term welfare effects inform over-fishing, excessive air pollution, and other natural resource and environmental problems. Allocations based on local conditions, prior use, and unconstrained by outside government mandates were most effective in both addressing the immediate threat of open-access and providing a longer-term basis for production, investment, and trade. Initial faulty property allocations and path dependencies are discussed.This is what stretched westward from the 100th meridian, this complex, misunderstood two fifths of the continental United States where men had come before law arrived and where before there were adequate maps there were warring interests, white against Indian, cattleman against sheepman and both against nester, open range notions against the use of the newly invented barbed wire, Gentile against Mormon, land rights against water rights, appropriation rights to water against riparian rights to water, legitimate small settler against speculator and land-grabber.

It assesses the work of the main Business Cycle Research Institutes in Western Europe the USA and Russia, as well as that of Kondratieff, Kuznets, Schumpeter, Abramovitz and the long-wave revivalists-Rostow, Mandel and Mensch. It concludes that the existence of regular long-term rhythms in capitalist development is not proven, but distinguishes major changes in the momentum of growth due to disturbances of an ad hoc character. The role of system shocks and historical accidents is important but the role of policy error and success is also emphasised. It identifies five major phases of capitalist development since 1820.;2007;Fluctuations in the momentum of growth within the capitalist epoch;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Marco, P. N.; Vam Malle-Sabouret, C.";Were eighteenth-century financial markets efficient? Neal (1990) shows that the London and Amsterdam markets were integrated. Yet some scholars find that the London capital market was either not integrated across various classes of securities, or was comprised of ignorant investors who were not knowledgeable enough to arbitrage across securities with different maturities, or was even irrational at times. In this article, we demonstrate that these London capital market inefficiencies suggested by previous scholars arise from an incorrect comprehension of the pricing of the financial instrument they use. After examining certain features peculiar to India bonds overlooked by previous authors, we make it clear that the London domestic market was perfectly integrated and that investors were capable of handling and pricing sophisticated options.;2007;East India bonds, 1718-1763: early exotic derivatives and London market efficiency;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Maurer, Noel; Haber, Stephen H.";Related lending, a widespread practice in LDCs, is widely held to encourage bankers to loot their banks at the expense of minority shareholders and depositors. We argue that neither looting nor credit misallocation are necessary outcomes of related lending. On the contrary, related lending often exists as a response to high information and contract-enforcement costs. Whether it encourages looting depends on other institutions, particularly those that create incentives to monitor directors. We examine Mexico's banking system, 1888–1913, in which there was widespread related lending. We find little evidence of credit misallocation, despite a financial crisis and government-organized rescue.;2007;Related Lending and Economic Performance: Evidence from Mexico;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
McCants, Anne E.C.;This paper examines nearly 1000 poor to middling citizen households from the city of Amsterdam with a view to assessing their place in the larger wealth distribution of the city as preliminarily sketched in the work of Soltow, van Zanden, and others. It utilizes the probate inventories drawn up by the Amsterdam Municipal Orphanage, which when coupled with the marriage, baptism, and burial records of the city archives, allow for the reconstruction of the household circumstances, material, financial, and demographic, of the families associated with the institution. These data yield detailed information about precisely the kind of people who were systematically excluded from the tax registers and financial records which form the basis for our current knowledge about inequality among historical populations. The lower portion of the wealth distribution is described and then linked via housing rental rates to a more complete distribution of the various social classes in the city. Finally, the determinants of inequality within the ranks of the poor are examined and financial assets of even very small amounts are found to be critical in shaping the socio-economic experience of the lower citizenry.;2007;Inequality among the poor of eighteenth century Amsterdam;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

McLean, Ian W.;Between 1870 and 1890 Australian incomes per capita were 40 percent or more above those in the United States. About half this gap is attributable to Australia’s higher labor input per capita, and half to its higher labor productivity. The higher labor input is due in part to favorable demographic attributes and partly to a favorable workforce participation rate. The higher productivity results from an advantageous natural resource endowment. By 1914 the income lead over the U.S. had all but disappeared due to declines in Australia’s advantages both in labor input per capita and in labor productivity.;2007;Why was Australia so rich?;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Murray, John E.; Nilsson, Lars";We test for substitutability of wage differentials and accident insurance benefits in late imperial Austria. We establish that workers earned compensating wage differentials and that accident insurance benefits acted as substitutes for those market-based differentials. We estimate that an average expected value of insurance benefit reduced the compensating wage differential by about one-third. The shift from negligence liability to compulsory accident insurance thus induced both gains to workers in the form of income certainty, and losses in the form of smaller risk differentials and thus lower wages.;2007;Accident risk compensation in late imperial Austria: Wage differentials and social insurance;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Nicolini, Esteban A.;This article shows that the interaction between economic and demographic variables in England before the onset of modern economic growth did not fit some crucial assumptions of the Malthusian model. I estimated a vector autoregression for data on fertility, mortality and real wages over the period 1541–1840 applying a well-known identification strategy broadly used in macroeconomics. The results show that endogenous adjustment of population to real wages functioned as Malthus assumed only until the seventeenth century: positive checks disappeared during the seventeenth century and preventive checks disappeared before 1740. This implies that the endogenous adjustment of population levels to changes in real wages — one of the cornerstones of the Malthusian model — did not work during an important part of the period usually considered within the ‘Malthusian regime’.;2007;Was Malthus right?

Nielsen, Heino Bohn;This paper performs a multivariate cointegration analysis of UK money demand 1873–2001, and illustrates how a long-run time series analysis may be conducted on a data set characterized by turbulent episodes and institutional changes. We suggest accounting for the effects of the two world wars by estimating additive data corrections, thereby allowing the propagation of war-time shocks to be fundamentally different from the transmission of peace-time innovations. In addition, the corrected series may be used in counterfactual event studies to assess the impacts of special events. In the empirical analysis we find a single equilibrium relationship relating velocity to opportunity costs, and we identify a significant link between excess money and inflation. After accounting for the turbulent periods, the equilibrium structure is reasonably stable over a period of 130 years.;2007;UK money demand 1873–2001: a long-run time series analysis and event study;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

O’HARA, GLEN;"This article outlines the attempts of British central government to react to the perceived inadequacy of official economic statistics. A huge amount of work went into this project, the main aim of which was to speed up the production of statistics so that the economy could be analysed in more detail, and thus better managed. If this was to work, more data was required on the labour market, on productivity, on production, and on the interlinkages between those indicators. British official statistics clearly were more comprehensive and more detailed at the end of this period than they had been at the start. Even so, the effort was usually thought to have been a failure by the early 1970s. More detail took time to produce; it was difficult to recruit the necessary staff; successive administrative reorganizations also absorbed energies. The devolved informality of British government hampered the emergence of an overall picture. Businesses and trade unions resisted attempts to collect more data, especially when it showed them in an unflattering light. Above all, the elite, specialist, and technical nature of the reform process meant that very little political and popular pressure built up to force through further changes.";2007;Towards a new Bradshaw?

OKAZAKI, TETSUJI;This paper explores how the Bank of Japan (BOJ) dealt with the trade-off between stability of the financial system and the moral hazard of banks in pre-war Japan. The BOJ concentrated Lender of Last Resort (LLR) loans with those banks that had an established transaction relationship with the BOJ.

Pamuk, Sevket;One important recent theme emerging from the literature on early modern Europe is that some of the key structural and institutional changes that are responsible for the increases in incomes may have taken place rather early, in the late medieval period or in the era of the Black Death. This study makes use of the recently compiled real wage evidence for different parts of Europe and the eastern Mediterranean to gain further insights into this period. The era of the Black Death witnessed a series of important long-term changes in demographic behaviour, in agriculture, in manufacturing, trade and technology. Real wage series reflect the productivity increases from these changes. They also suggest the Low Countries and England were able to resist to a greater extent the general tendency for wages to decline during the second leg of the demographic cycle that began with the Black Death. A wage gap thus began to emerge between the northwest and the rest of the continent after 1450. The last section of the article explores the reasons for this divergence.;2007;The Black Death and the origins of the 'Great Divergence' across Europe, 1300-1600;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Specifically, during 1841, misleading information concerning a possible foreign loan reached New Orleans three different times.

Phillips, William H.;Before 1820 Northern mechanics started factory-based cotton gin manufacturing to compete with traditional Southern “ginwrights.” Later, cotton gin production in factories was transferred to the South. This paper estimates the profitability of cotton gin makers in the antebellum industrial census. The Southern sector was more profitable than that of the North, explaining the regional migration of machine production resources. Besides transport cost protection, Southern firms had a cost advantage in sales and service networks. Specific factor investments in gin making limited further resource flows from North to South after 1840. It also reduced the industry’s impact on Southern economic development.;2007;Profitability and factory-based cotton gin production in the antebellum south;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
REIS, JAIME;As long as Portugal was on the gold standard, the Bank of Portugal sought to help stabilize the currency at the exchange rate to which the country was committed. Because it was subject to political and other non-economic constraints, the bank carried out discount rate interventions sparingly, although in accordance with what could be termed the contemporary ?science? of central banking. Consequently, it had to intervene frequently in the currency markets, usually in covert fashion, in order to conciliate the needs of convertibility with this less than orthodox stance towards the gold standard. This article also shows how the bank was able to keep on repeatedly infringing the ?rules of the game? with success for almost 30 years, and raises the question of the sustainability of such a state of affairs.;2007;An ‘art’, not a ‘science’?

Richardson, Gary;During the contraction from 1929 to 1933, the Federal Reserve System tracked changes in the status of all banks operating in the United States and determined the cause of each bank suspension. This essay analyzes chronological patterns in aggregate series constructed from that data. The analysis demonstrates both illiquidity and insolvency were substantial sources of bank distress. Periods of heightened distress were correlated with periods of increased illiquidity. Contagion via correspondent networks and bank runs propagated the initial banking panics. As the depression deepened and asset values declined, insolvency loomed as the principal threat to depository institutions.;2007;Categories and causes of bank distress during the great depression, 1929–1933: The illiquidity versus insolvency debate revisited;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Richardson, Gary;Weaknesses within the check-clearing system played a hitherto unrecognized role in the banking crises of the Great Depression. Correspondent check-clearing networks were vulnerable to counter-party cascades. Accounting conventions that overstated reserves available to corresponding institutions may have exacerbated the situation. The initial banking panic began when a correspondent network centered in Nashville collapsed, forcing over 100 institutions to suspend operations. As the contraction continued, additional correspondent systems imploded. The vulnerability of correspondent networks is one reason that banks that cleared via correspondents failed at higher rates than other institutions during the Great Depression.;2007;The Check is in the Mail: Correspondent Clearing and the Collapse of the Banking System, 1930 to 1933;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Schulze, Max-Stephan;This article examines patterns of structural change and labour productivity growth in the late nineteenth-century Habsburg Empire. Using shift-share analysis and a set of basic measures to account for the contribution of physical and human capital growth, it seeks to address three questions. First, what was the role of labour productivity growth in per capita income growth? Second, to what extent can structural change account for the comparatively slow growth of the Habsburg economy in general, and Austria's, in particular? Third, how important were physical and human capital stock growth in aggregate labour productivity growth in Austria-Hungary as compared to Germany? The article argues that, in contrast to the Hungarian experience, the size and performance of the agricultural sector imposed a severe burden on Austrian aggregate growth. Further, the evidence points to a significantly smaller contribution of TFP growth to aggregate and industrial labour productivity growth in Austria and Hungary than in Germany. A proximate cause for the TFP growth differential may be found in far smaller positive externalities derived from lower initial human capital endowments in the Habsburg lands.;2007;Origins of catch-up failure: Comparative productivity growth in the Habsburg Empire, 1870-1910;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Seltzer, Andrew J.;This paper uses personnel records of employees from an Australian bank to analyse the labour market consequences of career interruptions due to voluntary military service during the Second World War. The records contain the employees’ career position and pay histories, and pre-war outcomes are used to control for selection bias caused by non-random enlistment. It is shown that, despite losing human capital during the War, upon their return veterans did not face a wage penalty relative to non-volunteers. Finally, evidence from non-wage outcomes suggests that the absence of a wage penalty was a form of positive discrimination by the Bank.;2007;The effects of mid-career military enlistment on civilian career prospects: evidence from the Australian banking industry during World War II;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Stasavage, David;It has become common for authors to argue that government commitment to repay debt depends upon institutions. In this article I present new econometric evidence which shows that in one prominent case, Great Britain after 1688, credibility depended more immediately upon partisan preferences. The ‘revolution’ in British public finance may indeed have been spurred forward by the constitutional changes of the Glorious Revolution, but it was only consolidated in 1715, almost three decades later, during a ‘Whig Supremacy’ where a single party established unchecked control over British political institutions. It mattered a great deal for the final outcome that the Whig party was intimately associated with government creditors while their opponents, the Tories, were not. I provide evidence of a structural break in both government costs of borrowing and Bank of England share prices that is consistent with this argument. Using an ARCH-in-mean model, I then show that the evolution of the Whig majority in the House of Commons provides a better explanation for the evolution of government credibility than does either the assumption of a simple structural break in 1715, or an explanation focusing strictly on political stability, and ignoring partisan preferences. These findings have broad implications for our understanding of the determinants of credibility.;2007;Partisan politics and public debt: The importance of the 'Whig Supremacy' for Britain's financial revolution;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

White, Eugene Nelson;The crash of the French stock market in 1882 presented the Paris Bourse with its worst crisis of the nineteenth century. Its structure was similar in key respects to today’s futures markets, with a dominant forward market leading the Bourse to adopt a common fund to guarantee transactions and liquidity. While this mutualization of risk protects clients and brokers from idiosyncratic shocks, it is generally assumed that it also provides considerable protection against systemic shocks, as no twentieth century exchange has been forced to shut down. Using new archival data, this paper shows how a stock market crash overwhelmed the Bourse’s common fund. Only an emergency loan from the Bank of France, intermediated by the largest banks, prevented a closure of the Bourse.;2007;The Crash of 1882 and the Bailout of the Paris Bourse;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
WOLF, NIKOLAUS;How did the location of industry across interwar Poland react to the Polish reunification? After more than 120 years of political and economic separation, Poland was reunified at the end of 1918. In consequence, the removal of internal tariff barriers and improved infrastructure strengthened the domestic market, while foreign market relations were cut off. Similarly, the geographical distribution of factor endowments was changed, for example, through internal migration. How did these forces interact to determine the location of industry? We survey the dynamics of industrial location between 1902 and 1925–1937 and estimate a specification that nests market potential and comparative advantage to quantify their respective impact during the interwar years. The results point to a role for both, comparative advantage and access to markets. We show that both statistically and economically the most important factors were the endowment with skilled labour and inter-industry-linkages.;2007;Endowments vs. market potential: What explains the relocation of industry after the Polish reunification in 1918?;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

WRIGLEY, E. A.;When directing the first English census John Rickman was intent not only on discovering the size of the population in 1801 but also on tracing past trends both nationally and for individual counties. He returned to the latter investigation on several later occasions, notably in the 1830s. There have been many subsequent attempts to improve upon his national estimates, but his estimates of county totals have continued to be used extensively, either unchanged or slightly modified. Rickman was aware that his estimates were subject to wide margins of error. For the later eighteenth century it is possible to produce new estimates which are probably substantially more accurate, taking advantage of the fact that after Hardwicke?s Act (1753) the registration of marriages in Anglican parish registers, unlike that of baptisms and burials, was virtually complete. They show that the contrast between population growth rates in ?industrial? counties and those in which agriculture continued to predominate were significantly more marked than suggested by Rickman?s estimates. The same exercise that produces county estimates also yields hundredal totals, which will in future allow a more refined account of relative growth and stagnation to be made.;2007;English county populations in the later eighteenth century;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"ACHESON, GRAEME G.; Turner, John D.";In 1878, one of Britain’s largest banks, the City of Glasgow Bank, collapsed, leaving a huge deficit between its assets and liabilities. As this bank, similar to many other contemporary British banks, had unlimited liability, its failure was accompanied by the bankruptcy of the vast majority of its stockholders. It is generally believed that the collapse of this depository institution revealed the extent to which ownership in large joint-stock banks had been diffused to investors of very modest means. It is also believed that the failure resulted in bank shareholders dumping their shares unto the market. Our evidence, garnered from ownership records, trading data, and stock prices, offers no support for these widely held beliefs.;2008;The death blow to unlimited liability in Victorian Britain: The City of Glasgow failure;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Altug, S.; Filiztekin, A.; Pamuk, Sevket";This article considers the sources of long-term economic growth for Turkey over the period 1880–2005. The period in question covers the decline and eventual dissolution of the former Ottoman Empire and the emergence of the new Turkish Republic in 1923. Hence, the article provides a unique look at the growth experience of these two different political and economic regimes. The article examines in detail the evolution of factors that led to growth in output across broad periods, including the post-World War II period and the era of globalization beginning in the 1980s. It also considers output growth in the agricultural and non-agricultural sectors separately and allows for the effects of sectoral re-allocation. The lessons from this exercise have important implications for Turkey's future economic performance, for its ability to converge to per capita income levels of developed countries, and for the viability of its current bid for European Union membership.;2008;Sources of long-term economic growth for Turkey, 1880-2005;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Angeles, Luis;This paper studies the apparent inconsistency between the evolution of GDP per capita and real wages in pre-industrial Europe. We show that these two measures will diverge when any of the three following factors are present: changes in income distribution, changes in labour supply per capita and changes in relative prices. We propose a methodology for measuring the effects of these three factors and apply it to the case of 18th century England. For this particular episode the gap between the growth of GDP per capita and real wages can be successfully explained and the main explanatory factor is changes in labour supply per capita. Some further conclusions are drawn from the experience of England during the 19th century and Europe during the early modern period.;2008;GDP per capita or real wages?

Large establishments, measured here by employment, were much more likely to use steam power than smaller establishments. By 1880, slightly more than half of all manufacturing workers were employed in establishments using steam power, compared with 17 percent in 1850 and we show that, after controlling for various establishment characteristics, steam-powered establishments had higher labor productivity than establishments using other sources of power. Moreover, this productivity differential was increasing in establishment size.;2008;Steam power, establishment size, and labor productivity growth in nineteenth century American manufacturing;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
AUSTIN, GARETH;This article seeks to revise and re-apply the factor endowments perspective on African history. The propositions that sub-Saharan Africa was characterized historically by land abundance and labour scarcity, and that the natural environment posed severe constraints on the exploitation of the land surplus, are broadly upheld. Important alterations are suggested, however, centred on the seasonality of labour supply, Ruf's concept of ?forest rent?, and, for precolonial economies, the role of fixed capital. This revised endowments framework is then applied in order to explore the long-term dynamics of economic development in Africa, focusing on how the economic strategies of producers and political authorities created specific paths of change which shifted the production possibility frontiers of the economies concerned, and ultimately altered the very factor ratios to which the strategies had been responses.;2008;Resources, techniques, and strategies south of the Sahara: revising the factor endowments perspective on African economic development, 1500–2000;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Azomahou, Théophile;This paper contributes to the interface literature of new methodological foundation of analyzing historical data with space and spatio-temporal phenomena. In particular, I consider estimating the spatial panel autoregressive model using the minimum distance estimator. Spatial autoregression has important implications for economic system that typifies correlatedness across many spatial locations and which could evolve over long span of time. To overcome computational difficulties, I suggest a two-stage estimation procedure based on minimum distance estimators. A striking feature of the proposed model is that minimum distance estimates are derived under common slopes and complete equality of parameters across spatial units. Assumption of common slopes across spatial units is an empirical and theoretical plausibility as many spatial units are observed to share common trend and typology of changes occurring to the individual system under which equality of parameters are possibilities. The estimation strategy allows various restrictions on time-varying vector parameters. Moreover, those restrictions can easily be tested. I apply this procedure to the residential demand for water of 115 French municipalities over the biannual period 1988–1993. The primary contribution of the paper is to the methodological side of cliometrics while the empirical application (with shorter time period) has been presented for illustrative purpose although, it can nonetheless be readily applied to historical data with long-time horizon allowing for restrictions such as spatio-temporal common vector and structural break in parameter estimates.;2008;Minimum distance estimation of the spatial panel autoregressive model;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Although our evidence does not necessarily describe countrywide trends, it does support for an industrialising region the more positive view of the degree and nature of late tsarist economic growth.

"Bosker, M.; Brakman, S.; Garretsen, H.; Jong, H. de; Schramm, M.";The evolution of city growth is usually studied for relatively short time periods. The rise and decline of cities is, however, typically a process that takes many decades or even centuries. In this article we study the evolution of Italian cities over the period 1300–1861. Using an existing data set, we perform panel estimations where the development of city size and urban patterns can be explained by various geographical, institutional and other determinants of city size for the period under consideration. Although large shocks such as the plague epidemics are clearly visible in the data, our baseline estimation results show that the main determinants of Italian city growth are physical geography and the predominance of capital cities. With respect to geography, being a seaport or having access to navigable waterways increases city size whereas a city's relative location, measured by its urban potential, is not significant. Being a capital city also increases city size. The estimation results reveal strong century-specific effects on city growth and these effects differ markedly between the North and South of Italy. Additional estimations show that these time effects can be linked to the political and institutional developmental changes over time in Italy. Our findings that the capital city bonus increases and non-capital cities suffer when the political power and the institutions of the state are more centralised corroborate the idea that institutions are a key factor in explaining Italian city growth.;2008;Ports, plagues and politics: explaining Italian city growth 1300-1861;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Broadberry, Stephen N.; Burhop, Carsten";This response offers a critical appraisal of the claim of Albrecht Ritschl to have found a possible resolution to what he calls the Anglo-German industrial productivity puzzle, which arose as the result of a new industrial production index produced in an earlier paper by the same author. Projection back from a widely accepted 1935/36 benchmark using the Ritschl index showed German industrial labor productivity in 1907 substantially higher than in Britain. This presented a puzzle for at least two reasons. First, other comparative information from the pre—World War I period, such as wages, seems difficult to square with much higher German labor productivity at this time. Second, a direct benchmark estimate produced by Stephen Broadberry and Carsten Burhop, using production census information for Britain and industrial survey material of similar quality for Germany, suggested broadly equal labor productivity in 1907. Broadberry and Burhop also showed that if Walther Hoffmann's industrial output index was used instead of the Ritschl index for Germany, the puzzle largely disappeared.;2008;Resolving the Anglo-German Industrial Productivity Puzzle, 1895–1935: A Response to Professor Ritschl;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Burhop, Carsten;Germany's historical national accounts are controversially discussed in a series of recent papers by Fremdling and Stäglin (2004, 2005), Ritschl (2004) and Burhop and Wolff (2005). The growth of the German economy during the nineteenth century, the level of economic development reached in 1913 and the depth of the interwar slump are the major points of concern. This short article contributes to this debate by providing a benchmark estimate of labour productivity in mining, crafts and industry in 1913 using official input–output data. We confirm earlier results by Burhop and Wolff (2005) that the level of labour productivity in 1913 was much higher than the classical work by Hoffmann (1965) suggests.;2008;The level of labour productivity in German mining, crafts and industry in 1913: evidence from output data;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Calomiris, Charles W.; Mason, Joseph R.";Much of the puzzle of underissuance of national bank notes can be resolved for the period 1880–1900 (the period when detailed, bank-level data are available) by disaggregating, taking account of regulatory limits, and considering differences in banks’ opportunity costs cross-sectionally and over time. Banks with poor lending opportunities issued more, within regulatory limits. Banks tended to issue more when bond yields (the backing for notes) were high relative to lending opportunities. The profitability of note issuance was insufficient to attract entrants primarily or mainly for the purpose of note issuance. The observed lack of a general relationship between note issuance and reserve demand is inconsistent with the view that redemption costs from note issuance explain low note issuance in general. However, some variation in the propensities of urban banks to issue notes is associated with variation in reserve demand costs associated with the note issues of those banks. Generally, however, note issuance enjoyed economies of scope with deposit banking, including reduced costs of reserve requirements.;2008;Resolving the puzzle of the underissuance of national bank notes;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Canaday, Neil;This paper examines new data on wealth and wealth accumulation by blacks and whites in Calhoun County, South Carolina between 1910 and 1919. Despite focusing on a single county, the data utilized in this paper make it possible to explore property accumulation by southern blacks and whites in new ways. Unlike previous studies, this one provides information on both real quantities and dollar assessments. This breakdown reveals that the rapid accumulation of property by blacks was entirely real and not due in part to an increasingly discriminatory assessment policy. By merging the assessment data with individual-level census records, it is possible to examine how wealth and wealth accumulation were influenced by race, gender, age, occupation, and literacy. In particular, the effect of literacy on the wealth of black men in 1910 was found to be economically strong in high wealth quantiles but weak in low wealth quantiles. By 1919, the impact of literacy on the wealth of black men had become economically important across the board. Furthermore, literacy had a significant influence on the relative size of wealth accumulations but offered little protection against low accumulations.;2008;The accumulation of property by southern blacks and whites: Individual-level evidence from a South Carolina cotton county, 1910–1919;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Although blacks and whites today reach similar terminal statures in the United States, nineteenth-century African American statures were consistently shorter than those of whites.

Black farmers were taller than workers in other occupations, and, ironically, black youth statures increased during the antebellum period and decreased with slavery's elimination.;2008;The Effect of Geography and Vitamin D on African American Stature in the Nineteenth Century: Evidence from Prison Records;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Chanda, Areendam; Craig, Lee A.; Treme, Julianne";Standard economic indicators suggest that the USA experienced long-run economic growth throughout the nineteenth century. However, biological indicators, including human stature, offer a different picture, rising early in the century, falling (on average) mid-century, and rising again at the end of the century. This pattern varied across geographical regions. Using a unique data set, consisting of mean adult stature by state, we test for convergence in stature among states in the nineteenth century. We find that during the period of declining mean stature (1820–1870), heights actually diverged. Later in the century (1870–1890) we find a type of “negative” convergence indicating that stature among states tended to converge to a new, lower steady state. Only towards the end of the century (1880–1900) do we find classic convergence behavior. We argue that the diversity of economic experiences across regions, including urbanization, industrialization, and transportation improvements, explain this pattern of divergence and then convergence.;2008;Convergence (and divergence) in the biological standard of living in the USA, 1820–1900;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Chang, Howard H.; Danilevsky, Marina; Evans, David S.; Garcia-Swartz, Daniel D.";On the basis of anecdotes centered on the alleged “circuitous routing of checks,” researchers focusing on the pre-Fed check-clearing system have usually argued that it was inefficient. In this paper we study a 1910 check remittance register from the State National Bank of Bloomington, Illinois—we dissect the way the bank forwarded checks to various destinations for clearing and collection. We find that the bank followed an orderly process of check remittance according to which checks tended to move in the “right direction.” This casts doubts on the alleged pervasiveness of cycling and circuitous routing of an extreme nature in the pre-Fed check-clearing process.;2008;The economics of market coordination for the pre-Fed check-clearing system: A peek into the Bloomington (IL) node;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Church, Roy;Was a ?transformation of selling? in the US between the 1880s and 1930 exceptional? Archives of three leading British consumer goods companies reveal that a comparable transformation in selling methods was effected through the changing role for salesmen. Unlike the explanation offered for the transformation in the US, developments in Britain cannot be explained by a structural model in which the dynamics are mass production, size, corporate structure, and strategy. Consumer theory based on product characteristics and consumer behaviour provides a superior explanation. The history of marketing by the British companies also justifies a challenge to the production-driven interpretation of business development and corporate growth.;2008;Salesmen and the transformation of selling in Britain and the US in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Cinnirella, Francesco;Saxony was one of the pioneer regions in the German modern economic growth. We analyze the Saxon nutritional status to infer the effects of early industrialization on the population standard of living. We find that the nutritional status in the eighteenth century was relatively high and heights fluctuated mainly because of wars. From the 1770s the average nutritional status declined steadily, with the exception of the Napoleonic period, until the mid of the nineteenth century. The decline, particularly accentuated after 1815, is related to the high share of urbanization, the increase in the relative price of food, and the strong dependence on food imports.;2008;On the road to industrialization: nutritional status in Saxony, 1690–1850;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Cinnirella, Francesco;We revise previous estimates on average nutritional status in Britain during the industrial revolution. We find that average nutritional status declined substantially throughout the period 1740–1865, with a partial recovery only for the cohorts born in 1805–9 and 1810–14. The decline in nutritional status estimated for the second half of the eighteenth century is consistent with recent estimates of food prices and farm labour wages. We suggest that parliamentary enclosures and the decline of cottage industry could partially explain the fall in nutritional status. In addition, comparing the age at final attainment of height of a group of rural residents with a group of urban migrants we provide further evidence about the negative impact of urbanization during the early industrial revolution.;2008;Optimists or pessimists?

"Clay, Karen; JONES, RANDALL";Gold discoveries in 1848 set off a large and extremely rapid migration to California. This article uses newly collected data from the 1850 and 1852 Censuses of Population together with the public use sample of the 1850 Census of Population to examine who went to California and how they did economically. We find that the propensity to migrate was affected by the individual's age and literacy, distance of the state from California, and average state latitude. Consistent with the historical literature, we find that economic outcomes were generally small or even zero for miners but were positive and large for nonminers.;2008;Migrating to Riches?

"Clingingsmith, David; Williamson, Jeffrey G.";India was a major player in the world export market for textiles in the early 18th century, but by the middle of the 19th century it had lost all of its export market and much of its domestic market, primarily to Britain. The ensuing deindustrialization was greatest c1750–c1860. We ask how much of India’s deindustrialization was due to local supply-side forces—such as political fragmentation and a rising incidence of drought, and how much to world price shocks. An open, three-sector neo-Ricardian model organizes our thinking and a new relative price database implements the empirical analysis. We find local supply side forces were important from as early as 1700. We then assess the size of Indian deindustrialization in comparison with other parts of the periphery.;2008;Deindustrialization in 18th and 19th century India: Mughal decline, climate shocks and British industrial ascent;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Craft, Erik D.; Monks, James";The literature offers both supply-side and cotton demand-side explanations for the reduced level and growth of income in the postbellum South. Demand-side evidence begins with a single-equation relationship regressing the price of cotton on quantity and a trend term, although subsequent researchers have critiqued the economic significance of the supposed slowed growth in demand. Using a system of simultaneous equations, which allows for correction both for autocorrelation in the error terms and correlation of the error terms across equations, we find cotton demand to be unit elastic from 1865--1866 to 1894--1895 and that it grew between 1.1% and 2.8% a year.;2008;The postbellum demand for cotton revisited;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

There were discrepancies in performance across companies but ROCE and TFP typically fell during our period. Cost inefficiency rose before 1900 but then was brought under control as a profits collapse loomed.

"Craig, Lee A.; Holt, Matthew T.";This paper examines the role of mechanical refrigeration in seasonality and structural change in the U.S. hog–corn cycle, 1870–1940. This period covers an era in which the widespread adoption of mechanical refrigeration greatly affected the ability to store and transport perishable commodities. These developments in turn altered the seasonal production and price structure for many commodities, including pork. We use a new class of time series models, time-varying smooth transition autoregressions (TV-STARs), to document both the structural change and the nonlinear features observed in seasonal patterns for the U.S. hog–corn price relationship during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.;2008;Mechanical refrigeration, seasonality, and the hog–corn cycle in the United States: 1870–1940;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

These estimates are used to assess the vulnerability of the antebellum iron industry to foreign competition and the role of the tariff in fostering the industry’s early development. Domestic pig iron production is found to be highly sensitive to changes in import prices. Although import price fluctuations had a much greater impact on U.S. production than changes in import duties, our estimates suggest that the tariff permitted domestic output to be about 30–40 percent larger than it would have been without protection.;2008;The antebellum U.S. iron industry: Domestic production and foreign competition;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Di Matteo, Livio;The wealth of male decedents using census-linked probate records from 1892 and 1902 is examined for evidence on saving motives. This data presents an opportunity to examine wealth holding and saving motives in an environment devoid of many of the features that can affect modern retirement, consumption and saving decisions. Evidence is found supporting the existence of a strategic bequest motive. This result occurs after controlling for the possibility of the demand for children rising with the level of wealth as well as the potential contribution to wealth accumulation that children made in agricultural economies. These results also suggest that while the presence of a bequest motive was real and significant, its ultimate contribution to wealth accumulation was relatively modest when compared to the impact of variables such as occupational status and literacy. Moreover, there appears to be some evidence supporting a transition in saving motives away from bequest saving and towards greater life cycle saving.;2008;Wealth accumulation motives: evidence from the probate records of Ontario, 1892 and 1902;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

DOMENECH, JORDI;This paper studies the way workers and firms behaved in a highly cyclical sector such as the Catalan cotton textile industry. Using firm level evidence from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the paper shows that, in spite of weak unionization and the lack of regional or local collective bargaining institutions, piece rates in cotton spinning and weaving were not subject to competitive rate cuts and remained fixed over the cycle. When facing a negative demand shock, firms adjusted by reducing output, hours of work, labour productivity, and employment. The paper finally evaluates the possible sources of wage rigidity in the industry.;2008;Labour market adjustment a hundred years ago: the case of the Catalan textile industry, 1880–1913;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
DRAPER, N.;Through analysing the composition of the founding shareholders in the West India and London Docks, this article explores the connections between the City of London and the slave economy on the eve of the abolition of the slave trade. It establishes that over one-third of docks investors were active in slave-trading, slave-ownership, or the shipping, trading, finance, and insurance of slave produce. It argues that the slave economy was neither dominant nor marginal, but instead was fully integrated into the City's commercial and financial structure, contributing materially alongside other key sectors to the foundations of the nineteenth-century City.;2008;The City of London and slavery: evidence from the first dock companies, 1795–1800;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"EJRNÆS, METTE; Persson, Karl Gunnar; RICH, SØREN";This paper traces the evolution of the international market for wheat, from an emerging market structure after the repeal of the corn laws to a mature market characterized by efficient arbitrage after the introduction of the transatlantic telegraph and the growth of trade. Efficiency is documented using traditional price gap accounting as well as error correction modelling. Markets which traded directly with each other as well as markets which did not trade with each other were integrated. The traditional bilateral focus in market integration studies has been extended to a multivariate approach, which generates new insights into the pattern of diffusion of price shocks in the international economy. Shocks in the major importing nation, Britain, dominated in the emerging market phase, while shocks in the major exporting economy, the United States, dominated international price movements at the end of the nineteenth century.;2008;Feeding the British: convergence and market efficiency in the nineteenth-century grain trade;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
FERDERER, J. PETER;The rapid development of the nationwide telephone network following the expiration of the Bell patents in 1894, along with expansion of private wire telegraph networks, created the “nerve center” necessary for rapid growth in the decentralized, dealer-intermediated, over-the-counter security markets. Using membership roles from the National Quotation Bureau—the predecessor of the NASDAQ—I link growth in the number of dealers to the expansion of these communication networks prior to World War I. Moreover, trading activity on the organized stock exchanges fell during this period, suggesting that these technologies provided a competitive advantage to the over-the-counter markets.;2008;Advances in Communication Technology and Growth of the American Over-the-Counter Markets, 1876–1929;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Ferrie, Joseph P.; Troesken, Werner";Between 1850 and 1925, the crude death rate in the City of Chicago fell by 60 percent. We estimate that 30–50 percent of this reduction can be attributed water purification measures and the subsequent eradication of diarrheal diseases and typhoid fever and its sequella. Our findings are consistent with a proposition that early public-health scholars referred to as the Mills–Reincke phenomenon. According to advocates of the Mills–Reincke phenomenon, for every one death from typhoid fever that was prevented by water purification, there were three or more deaths from other causes (not usually considered waterborne) that were also prevented. At least part of this phenomenon appears to have driven by the fact that typhoid had a low case fatality rate but so weakened its survivors that they were vulnerable to later infections from tuberculosis and pneumonia. There is also evidence that typhoid survivors eventually developed kidney problems from which they later succumbed. These findings have implications for public health policies in developing countries.;2008;Water and Chicago’s mortality transition, 1850–1925;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Field, Alexander J.;This paper considers the productivity impact on the US economy of the period of war mobilization and demobilization lasting from 1941 to 1948. Optimists have pointed to learning by doing in military production and spin-offs from military R & D as the basis for asserting a substantial positive effect of military conflict on potential output. Productivity data for the private non-farm economy are not consistent with this view, as they show slower total factor productivity (TFP) growth between 1941 and 1948 than before or after. The paper argues for adopting a less rosy perspective on the supply side effects of the war.;2008;The impact of the Second World War on US productivity growth;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
GAZELEY, I. A.N.;This article reviews the evidence pertaining to changes in women's relative pay during the Second World War and presents new evidence relating to important wartime manufacturing industries. It is argued that gender pay inequality declined sharply where women were employed in industries that had previously been dominated by men, but did not occur in industries that had traditionally been important areas of female employment. The explanation for this pattern probably lies in a combination of excess demand effects and institutional factors, both of which were strongest in wartime munitions industries. Because of the importance of these industries to the war economy, the behaviour of inequality in munitions dominates the behaviour of inequality across all industries. Nearly all existing scholarship acknowledges the impact of the Second World War on reducing the employment segregation of women, but simultaneously views the war as an unimportant episode in the history of gender pay inequality. This article shows how the transition from ?female? to ?male? work also led to a significant improvement in women's relative pay.;2008;Women's pay in British industry during the Second World War;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Gelman, S.; Burhop, Carsten";In this article, we investigate the information efficiency of the Berlin stock exchange using returns of a new daily stock-market index for the years 1892–1913. We focus on the impact of the 1896 stock exchange law and of the increases of the stock-market turnover tax in 1894 and 1900 on information efficiency. We fit an ARMA(0,1)-GARCH(1,1) model to the data and search for structural breaks. This approach yields no convincing evidence that the tax increases had a negative influence on weak information efficiency. In addition, the restriction of derivative trading by the 1896 stock exchange law did not result in measurable changes in the autocorrelation of daily returns.;2008;Taxation, regulation and the information efficiency of the Berlin stock exchange, 1892-1913;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Geraghty, Thomas M.; Wiseman, Thomas";By relating strike outcomes and durations to the value of the disputed wage change and to the cost to each side of continuing the strike, this paper tests the hypothesis that the war of attrition with asymmetric information model of strikes accurately describes the characteristics of strikes over wages in the United States in the early to middle part of the 1880s. That hypothesis is not rejected by linear, probit, or nonparametric kernel estimation. Specifically, variables that decrease a side’s cost of striking or increase its opponent’s cost are shown to increase its maximum holdout time, and vice versa, and strike duration increases with the value of the prize in dispute and with uncertainty about the outcome. Alternative game theoretic models of strikes—signaling and screening models, and models with ongoing negotiations—do not fit the data as well. We also explore why the strikes took the form of wars of attrition, and why later strikes did not. Our results have implications for modern union behavior in the face of globalization.;2008;Wage strikes in 1880s America: A test of the war of attrition model;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Gonzalez de Lara, Y.;This article examines the institutional foundations of the financial market underpinning Venice's commercial success during the late medieval period. A public-order, reputation-based institution enabled merchants to commit (i) not to flee with investors' capital, despite the limited geographical reach of the legal system, and (ii) not to breach their contracts, despite the investors' inability to directly monitor them. Economic rents in Venice motivated merchants to submit to the city's authorities, while tight administrative trading controls provided the information required to verify a contractual breach. These institutional arrangements differed from other public-order and reputation-based institutions that have been considered in the literature.;2008;The secret of Venetian success: a public-order, reputation-based institution;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
GOOSE, NIGEL;There has been considerable debate concerning the impact of the industrial employment of women upon their demographic behaviour in nineteenth-century England. This article assesses the impact of employment in the cottage industry of straw plait and hat making in the county of Hertfordshire, comparing and contrasting districts where the industry was prominent with those where it was not. It is discovered that in 1851 the availability of straw industry employment encouraged earlier marriage, most notably in those parishes where the industry was particularly heavily concentrated, although overall levels of nuptiality and proportions ultimately marrying were similar in straw and non-straw areas alike. By 1871, however, the skewed sex ratio that such employment produced among young adults served to offset this positive effect. As the industry waned in the later nineteenth century, the experience of different regions of the county converged, while throughout the period the data suggest that urban/rural contrasts and the suburbanization of London produced more stark contrasts in female marriage patterns than did the availability of cottage industry employment.;2008;Cottage industry, migration, and marriage in nineteenth-century England;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Grantham, George W.;"The large-scale structure of world economic history exhibits three steady states punctuated by two phase transitions. The first transition arrived with the domestication of plants and animals; the second with the invention of engines capable of converting thermal to mechanical energy for applications in mining, manufacturing, and transportation. Yet, although both transitions led to increases in the absolute size of the economy, they affected the standard of living differently. Whereas the Industrial Revolution resulted in sustained growth in real per capita income for more than two centuries, over nine millennia the Agricultural Revolution spent itself in population growth that left per capita income insignificantly higher, and possibly lower than the level prevailing under hunting and gathering. This pattern raises three fundamental questions in economic history: why did the first great technological transition produce secular stasis in living standards? Why has the second yielded both steady growth in population and rising living standards? What triggered the transition from the stationary agricultural state to the progressive industrial state?";2008;Explaining the industrial transition: a non-Malthusian perspective;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Greenwood, Michael J.;This paper develops and estimates models of family and sex-specific emigration, as well as the sex composition of this emigration, from 12 European source countries to the U.S. for the period 1870–1910. The models are based on the distinction between economic migrants (males, single females, and some married females) and tied or trailing migrants (females) and are estimated with panel data, including data that relate to the occupational/industrial structure of male and female economic activity in source countries. Hausman-Taylor instrumental variable estimates suggest that although both males and females responded to labor-market signals, males were more responsive than females to per capita GDP differences. Moreover, compared to the rest of Europe, Ireland, and Scandinavia were the sources of many young, single male, and female migrants, who responded strongly to gaps in economic opportunities. In fact, much of the European response to such gaps appears to be due to migrants from Ireland and Scandinavia. Females tended to originate in English-speaking countries and countries that were agriculturally oriented. Service and manufacturing jobs in source countries discouraged the migration of females relative to males. Males tended to follow recent migrants more than females, but females responded more to long-term influences as measured by stocks of migrants from their source countries who had previously settled in the U.S. Countries with high birth rates had relatively fewer female emigrants, whereas those with high rates of natural increase 20 years earlier experienced relatively more male emigration. Intact families, other family members (including family-strategy male migrants and trailing female migrants), and single males and females responded strongly to economic incentives, but the singles were most responsive followed by family-strategy males.;2008;Family and sex-specific U.S. immigration from Europe, 1870–1910: A panel data study of rates and composition;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Banks in prefectures further from the financial centers exhibited higher loan rates and greater spreads than banks closer to the center, however, distance effects diminished over time, suggesting that banking markets became increasingly integrated due to declines in transaction costs. Additionally, loan rates and spreads varied negatively with the intensity of local bank competition, consistent with the notion of market segmentation.

Harley, C. Knick;Meat transformed North Atlantic shipping, leading to dominance of liners and changed the economics of freight rates. Management coordination of meat shipment led to concentration in shipping. Only liner companies could provide specialized ships with the regularity needed and they dominated North Atlantic shipping. The cargo capacity of cattle ships, beyond that used for animals, lowered freight rates on grain below levels that would otherwise have prevailed. The berth rate on wheat from New York to Liverpool was most affected. Consequently, this readily available freight rate can be potentially misleading as an indicator of ocean shipping developments.;2008;Steers Afloat: The North Atlantic Meat Trade, Liner Predominance, and Freight Rates, 1870–1913;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

We suggest that an efficient-market explanation may better explain this finding than a dual-economy explanation. Our findings also show that the stock market increased significantly in value in the post-Famine period.

Hilt, Eric;This paper analyzes the trade-off between risk and incentives in the share contracts of the American whaling industry. Using a newly collected panel of 5378 individuals who sailed on more than 1000 whaling voyages from 1855–68, the response of sailors’ compensation to an increase in risk is estimated. The risks used to identify this response resulted from the commerce-raiding naval vessels of the Confederacy during the Civil War. As the Confederate cruisers sailed primarily in the Atlantic, and therefore posed far less of a threat to whaling voyages to other oceans, a quasi-experimental approach focusing on the differences between Atlantic voyages compared to others is implemented. The results are consistent with a negative trade-off between risk and incentives in the industry’s contracts. Moreover, evidence is found of selection among less risk-averse sailors and merchants into riskier voyages during the war.;2008;The negative trade-off between risk and incentives: Evidence from the american whaling industry;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

HIPKIN, STEPHEN;During Tawney's century, Kent was London's principal coastwise supplier of grain. This trade was concentrated in the ports of Milton, Faversham, and Sandwich, and largely controlled by merchant-oligarchs living in them, who played a pivotal role in fostering the development of market integration and regional agrarian specialization. In periods of shortage, urban merchants prioritized their own commercial interest, and the subsistence needs of their own resident poor, at the expense of the county's rural poor, and in opposition to policies advocated by their guardians on the county bench. The regional politics of dearth need to be analysed at least as much in terms of vertical as of horizontal fissures in the social structure, and against the background of the politics of plenty, for over-dependence on the London market provoked protest from producers following good harvests and hardened their attitudes to the poor when the situation was reversed. Some forms of popular protest usually assumed to embody plebeian critiques of the failures of local justices should in fact be read primarily as expressions of the unity that often bound governors and their client-poor in opposition to the rival subsistence claims of other little commonwealths.;2008;The structure, development, and politics of the Kent grain trade, 1552–1647;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"HOWKINS, ALUN; VERDON, NICOLA";This article argues that farm service was an adaptable and sustainable system of hiring labour in areas of midland and southern England after 1850, having much in common with the model recently identified for northern England and Scotland. Analysing the Census Enumerators Books from selected parishes in seven counties in 1851, 1871, and 1891, we reveal an intricate pattern of farm service ?survival? both within and between counties. We then use a range of reports printed between the 1860s and 1920s to examine the national picture. The later regional persistence of farm service has implications for broader debates on the rural workforce and social relations.;2008;Adaptable and sustainable?

Huberman, Michael;Standard trade theory, as invoked by political scientists and economists, would anticipate that workers in Belgium, a small Old World country, rich in labour relative to land, were in a good position to benefit from the wave of globalization before 1914. However, wage increases remained modest and ?labour? moved slowly towards adopting a free-trade position. Beginning in 1885, the Belgian labour party backed free trade, but its support was conditional on more and better social legislation. Belgian workers' wellbeing improved in the wave of globalization, but the vehicle was labour and social legislation and not rising wages.;2008;Ticket to trade: Belgian labour and globalization before 1914;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Inwood, Kris; Keay, Ian";Was the average late nineteenth century Canadian manufacturer a hopelessly inefficient laggard when compared to his American counterparts just on the other side of the international border? Could it have been that Canadian producers were really productivity leaders so early in their industrialization process? To answer these fundamental questions about the performance of a small open economy at a key juncture in its industrial development we need a quantitative comparison of Canadian relative to US productivity. Unfortunately, the approach we adopt with respect to data compilation, methodological choice, and the identification of inputs, outputs, input weights, and prices has both quantitative and qualitative effects on any performance assessment we may undertake. To illustrate the severity of these effects we use manuscript census data from 1870/1871 to derive a series of total factor productivity (TFP) comparisons for a sample of manufacturing establishments located immediately to the north and south of the Canada–US border. Even with some of the most common and defensible variable definitions, we find dramatic differences between the most optimistic and most pessimistic assessments of late nineteenth century Canadian performance. Our case study suggests to us that those interested in the assessment of long run performance differentials should appreciate the sensitivity of these assessments and they should carefully consider the approach that has been taken toward data preparation, methodological choice, and variable definitions in their construction.;2008;The devil is in the details: assessing early industrial performance across international borders using late nineteenth century North American manufacturers as a case study;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

It is shown that ICT’s contribution to GDP growth in 1990–2004 was three times as large as electricity’s contribution in 1920–1938. The improvement of multi-factor productivity in production accounted for 60% of ICT’s contribution but only one third of electricity’s.

JONES, GEOFFREY;This article examines the globalization of the beauty industry between 1945 and 1980. This industry grew quickly. Firms employed marketing and marketing strategies to diffuse products and brands internationally, despite business, economic, and cultural obstacles to globalization. The process was difficult and complex. The globalization of toiletries proceeded faster than cosmetics, skin care, and hair care. By 1980, strong differences remained among consumer markets. Although American influence was strong, it was already evident that globalization had not resulted in the creation of a stereotyped American blonde and blue-eyed female beauty ideal as the world standard, although it had significantly narrowed the range of variation in beauty and hygiene ideals.;2008;Blonde and blue-eyed?

KANDER, ASTRID;This paper challenges the idea that emissions of greenhouse gases simply increase over time with income. It adopts a 200-year perspective and includes the important flows of greenhouse gases related to agriculture, not just the CO2 from fossil fuels. The result is that the pattern of Swedish total greenhouse gas emissions over time resembles an N. In contrast, when only emissions from fossil fuels are counted, the pattern over time resembles an inverted U. Among the most important factors generating emissions in agriculture, forest management was especially important, but in addition, draining of wetlands for agriculture played a substantial role.;2008;Is it simply getting worse?

KHOUDOUR-CASTÉRAS, DAVID;"The rapid decline of German emigration before World War I constitutes a puzzle that traditional explanations have difficulty in solving. The article shows that the social legislation implemented by Bismarck during the 1880s—the most developed at the time—played a key role in this process. Indeed, candidates for migration considered not only the gap between “direct wages” (labor earnings) in the United States and Germany, but also the differential in “indirect wages,” that is, social benefits. In that way, Bismarck's insurance system partly offset low wage rates in Germany and furthered the fall of the emigration rate.O sprecht! warum zogt ihr von dannen?Das Neckartal hat Wein und Korn;Der Schwarzwald steht voll finstrer Tannen,Im Spessart klingt des Ålplers Horn.Wie wird es in den fremden WäldernEuch nach der Heimatberge Grün,Nach Deutschlands gelben Weizenfeldern,Nach seinen Rebenhügeln ziehn!Ferdinand Freiligrath";2008;Welfare State and Labor Mobility: The Impact of Bismarck's Social Legislation on German Emigration before World War I;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Koepke, Nikola; Baten, Jörg";Land per capita was one important determinant of height in the Malthusian world 0 to 1800 A.D. A second factor was specialization in milk cattle agriculture. It had two positive effects on human stature: first, proximity to protein production resulted in a very low local shadow price of milk, as this important foodstuff could not be transported easily. Second, this low price resulted in a low inequality of nutritional status, whereas, for example, tradable pork contributed to nutritional inequality. For this study, we used a data set of more than two million animal bones to measure specialization in cattle and its impact on stature.;2008;Agricultural specialization and height in ancient and medieval Europe;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
La Prados De Escosura, Leandro;Economic rather than political forces appear to dominate inequality trends in Spain. Inequality evolution fits a Kuznets curve. Wars increased inequality but had non-permanent effects, while progressive taxation had no impact until 1980, at odds with Atkinson, Piketty, Saez and associates' findings. A substantial fall in absolute poverty resulted from growth but also from inequality reduction in the interwar period and the late 1950s. Rising inequality and extreme poverty are not found at the roots of the Spanish Civil War. Between the mid 1950s and 1974, inequality contraction and absolute poverty eradication represented a major departure from Latin America's performance while matching the OECD's.;2008;Inequality, poverty and the Kuznets curve in Spain, 1850-2000;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Lee, Chulhee;This article explores how injuries, sickness, and the geographic mobility of Union Army veterans while in service affected their postservice migrations. Wartime wounds and illnesses significantly diminished the geographic mobility of veterans after the war. Geographic moves while carrying out military missions had strong positive effects on their postservice geographic mobility. Geographic moves while in service also influenced the choice of destination among the migrants. I discuss some implications of the results for the elements of self-selection in migration, the roles of different types of information in migration decisions, and the overall impact of the Civil War on geographic mobility.;2008;Health, Information, and Migration: Geographic Mobility of Union Army Veterans, 1860–1880;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Lübbers, Thorsten;We investigate the wealth effects of takeovers in the mining industry of the German Ruhr district between 1896 and 1913. We employ event study methodology and use a new data set that covers stock prices of joint-stock mining companies and information on share prices of Gewerkschaften, an organisational form that was exclusively designed for German mining companies. Our empirical results show that takeovers enhanced shareholder value. The clear beneficiaries were the owners of the acquired companies, those of the acquirers hardly gained significantly.

"Martínez-Galarraga, Julio; Paluzie, Elisenda; Pons, Jordi; Tirado-Fabregat, Daniel A.";This paper analyses the relationship between spatial density of economic activity and interregional differences in the productivity of industrial labour in Spain during the period 1860–1999. In the spirit of Ciccone and Hall (Am Econ Rev 86:54–70, 1996) and Ciccone (Eur Econ Rev 46:213–227, 2002), we analyse the evolution of this relationship over the long term in Spain. Using data on the period 1860–1999 we show the existence of an agglomeration effect linking the density of economic activity with labour productivity in the industry. This effect was present since the beginning of the industrialisation process in the middle of the nineteenth century but has been decreasing over time. Our results show that doubling employment density raises average labour productivity in the industrial sector by between 3 and 5% in all periods analysed, with the exception of the last segment from the twentieth century. Hence, we find significant evidence of agglomeration effects. However, these effects seem to have been falling sharply from the mid-nineteenth century until late in the twentieth century, and there appears to be no positive evidence of agglomeration effects in industry in the period 1985–1999. This result could be explained by an important increase in the congestion effects in large industrial metropolitan areas that would have compensated the centripetal or agglomeration forces at work. Furthermore, this result is also consistent with the evidence of a dispersion of industrial activity in Spain during the last decades.;2008;Agglomeration and labour productivity in Spain over the long term;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

McCants, Anne E.C.;This paper challenges the prevailing view among economic historians that tea and coffee were luxury articles of consumption prior to the nineteenth century. It reviews an array of available evidence, including national trade statistics and probate inventory studies. In particular, it examines the surprisingly wide social and economic diffusion of tea and coffee drinking among Amsterdam citizens of lower to middling economic status during the period of that city's ascendency and subsequent decline at the centre of global trade networks. Using the distribution of tea and coffee wares of both local and exotic manufacture across households of the artisanal and labouring classes, it seeks to map both the economic reach of the East Indian trade into the poorer parts of the city, as well as to locate the cultural meanings associated with the consumption of these new goods. New data to address this issue have been derived from a substantial collection of after-death inventories drawn up on the estates of middling and poor Amsterdam citizens in the middle decades of the eighteenth century by the Regents of the Municipal Orphanage.;2008;Poor consumers as global consumers: the diffusion of tea and coffee drinking in the eighteenth century;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
McCloskey, Deirdre N.;"The American novelist Scott Fitzgerald is supposed to have said once to Ernest Hemingway, ‘You know, the rich are different from you and me.’ Hemingway replied, ‘Yes. They've got more money.’ Gregory Clark is of the Fitzgerald school. Most economic historians, among them his critics, follow Hemingway instead.

Clark modestly sub-entitles his book ‘A Brief Economic History of the World’. Brief indeed. In one-and-a-half pages towards the middle he deals briskly with the numerous alternatives to his materialist and richness-admiring hypothesis: ‘Social historians may invoke the Protestant Reformation, . . . intellectual historians the Scientific Revolution . . . or the Enlightenment . . . But a problem with these invocations of movers from outside the economic realm is that they merely push the problem back one step.’2

That's a very good point. Always a good point. Yes, indeed, one may properly ask why ‘after more than a thousand years of entrenched Catholic dogma’ – set aside that such a view of Christian theology might be viewed as a trifle lacking in nuance, derivative in fact from anti-Catholic propaganda since Voltaire – ‘was an obscure German preacher able to effect such a profound change in the way ordinary people conceived religious beliefs?’";2008;'You know, Ernest, the rich are different from you and me': a comment on Clark's A Farewell to Alms;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Evidence is presented that equities, options, and bonds priced risks consistently, suggesting that investors were actively monitoring the risk of investing and were not caught up in an irrational, speculative mania. Implied probability density functions for stock returns suggest that option markets exhibited growing concern about substantial price declines prior to the crash. Concerns were concentrated on riskier, more leveraged firms.

Persson, Karl Gunnar;Greg Clark is a master of the art of using one-liners in telling stories and Farewell to Alms: A Brief Economic History of the World is no exception. It offers the Malthusian hypothesis of population growth leading to misery as an all-purpose vehicle for all human history, except for the last 200 years. However, his Malthusianism is at times more evangelical than empirical and analytical. He dismisses Angus Maddison's painstaking efforts (e.g. Maddison 2001, 2003) at providing an empirical basis for long-run income estimates (p. 19) as inconsistent with the logic of the Malthusian economy. When the historical record contradicts Greg Clark it is not allowed to stand in the way of his noble aim and declared intention of writing big history. At least in one respect he has succeeded: this book is the widescreen version of the Postan Thesis, although M. M. Postan (1966, 1972) is remarkably missing in the credits. The book is also big in rhetorical gestures, starting with the title, and a reader must be forgiven for occasionally asking whether the author should be interpreted literally, or whether statements should simply be deflated by common sense.

It was all made possible by the Bisenzone exchange fairs, which created an efficient financial network under Genoese control and permitted arbitrage among northern Italian financial markets. At Bisenzone, Genoese bankers raised money for these loans from a variety of sources, which reduced the risks of lending and funded the king's long-term obligations via short term loans.

Based on this case, the article takes issue with two predominant views in the current literature: a view that sees the European integration process, at least in its early stages, as driven largely by nation-states and political agendas; and another view, widespread among business and economic historians, that contacts between business associations at that time served the main purpose of re-establishing international cartels. The CEIF actually performed a wide variety of functions: it represented organized business at international events and in organizations, acted as a multilateral arena for the exchange of information and for building trust among the businesspeople of various European countries, and, from 1958 onwards, helped bridge the divide between those inside and those outside the Common Market.

Scherner, Jonas;"In 1934, the Nazi regime decided to expand German staple fibre capacities significantly. The planned expansion expressed by the ?National Pulp Programme? was not only motivated by the balance of payments crisis at this time, but also by long-term autarky considerations. However, private companies and the Nazi regime disagreed on the size of the cellulose fibre markets and on how risks were to be shared. Therefore the Nazi regime considered the foundation of privately owned but actually state controlled new suppliers as a way of influencing the private companies to comply with its demands. However, as far as the established companies' willingness to invest was concerned, this strategy did not prove particularly successful. These companies were disposed to invest but only according to their long-term expectations regarding the potential staple fibre market given normal conditions; that is, with no import restrictions on natural fibres. Surprisingly, not only the big, established companies but also the private shareholders of the regional plants?often comparatively small textile companies?were not forced by the state to fulfil the requirements of the Nazi regime. Therefore these results suggest that the still-prevailing command economy thesis is not supported by the evidence.";2008;The beginnings of Nazi autarky policy: the ‘National Pulp Programme’ and the origin of regional staple fibre plants;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
SCHOFIELD, PHILLIPP R.;A significant issue for the historical investigation of the nature of the economy and society of the medieval English village has been the extent to which wealthier villagers were able and willing to respond to the needs of their less fortunate neighbours through informal charity, including the extension of credit and lowered costs for foodstuffs in periods of harvest failure. This article presents a case study of aspects of the local economy, principally viewed through land market activity and inter-personal litigation, in the early fourteenth century. It concludes that, in this context, there is little evidence for such non-aggressive activity during the subsistence crises of c.1300. Instead, a focus on the market and best economic opportunity persisted in ways that were likely to have been antithetical to contemporary views of charitable giving and which may have informed other aspects of social and economic dealing within the local community.;2008;The social economy of the medieval village in the early fourteenth century;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Scott, Peter M.;This article examines the links between working-class home ownership and family limitation in interwar Britain. Purchasing a suburban house enabled families to buy into a new, aspirational model of working-class respectability. Embracing this model entailed increased accommodation costs and higher levels of conspicuous consumption, placing great strains on many household budgets. Owner-occupiers therefore sought to limit the size of their families in order to sustain their new lifestyles. Meanwhile the new suburban ideology strongly emphasized improved standards of childcare, based around creating a high-quality domestic environment, and thus directly encouraged families to aim for fewer, but better-resourced children.;2008;Did owner-occupation lead to smaller families for interwar working-class households?;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Siklos, Pierre L.;A notable feature of the 1920s and 1930s is the volatility in several key macroeconomic aggregates, and this feature used to econometrically identify the reaction of the Fed to stock market developments. The volatility of economic activity may have contributed to deepening the divisions among policy-makers about how the Fed ought to respond to stock price developments. Relying on the technique of [Rigobon, R. 2003. Identification through heteroskedasticity. Review of Economics and Statistics 85, 777–792], volatility is used as an instrument to estimate the Fed’s response to the stock market. Other identification assumptions based on structural VARs produce compatible results. Fed behavior appeared to have changed following the stock market crash of 1929. Consistent with the Riefler-Burgess doctrine, interest rates and stock returns are negatively related. I conclude that, prior to the stock market crash of 1929, a form of benign neglect explains Fed behavior. Thereafter, the Fed reacts only slightly more aggressively to stock market developments.;2008;The Fed’s reaction to the stock market during the great depression: Fact or artefact?;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Spoerer, Mark;Following the seminal work of the late nineteenth century economist Etienne Laspeyres I analyse the incidence of the Prussian milling and slaughter tax shortly before its repeal in 1875. A comparison of flour prices in cities which levied this tax with those that did not reveals unusually strong tax overshifting. Modern theories explain overshifting of a specific tax with quality improvements or imperfect competition. In pursuing these ideas I find that it was rather large surplus costs induced by tax collection and monitoring that caused unusually large excess burdens. The reason why the tax remained basically unchanged for more than half a century is that the urban bourgeoisie successfully prevented its repeal, as the alternative would have been the introduction of municipal direct taxes (rent-seeking behaviour).;2008;The Laspeyres-Paradox: tax overshifting in nineteenth century Prussia;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Temin, Peter;The German currency was controlled and German banks closed in July 1931. Does it matter whether poor currency management or poor banking practice led to the crisis? This paper argues that it does—because the choice indicates which decisions led to the Great Depression.

Data and economic analysis indicate clearly that the crisis originated in the currency, not the banks.

Importantly, the government reduced the usury rate in 1714, sharply reducing the circle of private clients that could be served profitably.;2008;Private borrowing during the financial revolution: Hoare's Bank and its customers, 1702–24;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Thomasson, Melissa A.; Treber, Jaret";This paper examines the shift in childbirth from home to hospital that occurred in the United States in the early 20th century. Using a panel of city-level data over the period 1928–1940, we examine the impact on maternal mortality resulting from the shift of childbirth from home to hospital. Results suggest that until the late 1930s when sulfa drugs were developed, medical intervention had a limited impact on maternal mortality. Post-sulfa, the medicalization of childbirth reduced maternal mortality. Regressions estimated separately by race provide mixed evidence as to whether blacks and whites benefited differentially from medical intervention.;2008;From home to hospital: The evolution of childbirth in the United States, 1928–1940;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
VAMPLEW, WRAY;Golf was one of the fastest growing recreational sports in Britain before 1914. It created a market for professional golfers as shopkeepers, teachers, green-keepers, and craftsmen. A database of 3,000 players was used to examine their social and economic experience at club and competitive level, and this experience was then compared to that of professionals in horseracing, cricket, and football. Golfers were the first sportsmen to permanently organize themselves with the establishment of the PGA in 1901, which provided welfare services and promoted tournaments, thus actively and uniquely assisting the development of the industry within which its members worked.;2008;Successful workers or exploited labour?

Vonyó, Tamás;This article briefly reviews the core literature on the Golden Age of economic growth and tests the explanatory power of alternative theories against one another, with particular emphasis on the reconstruction thesis as developed by Jánossy. While previous empirical work on the subject relied on cross-sectional analysis, I employ panel-data techniques, which produce more robust estimates. I demonstrate that, for the core western industrialised nations, the rapidity and variety of economic growth during the 1950s and 1960s can mostly be explained by post-war reconstruction, the completion of which marked the end of the Golden Age. Labour-force expansion also made a very strong positive contribution. In the more peripheral countries of the OECD, however, rapid catching-up from the late 1950s was largely brought about by structural modernisation. Finally, human-capital accumulation has had a determining impact on long-run growth potentials, modelled here as time-constant country-fixed effects.;2008;Post-war reconstruction and the Golden Age of economic growth;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Voth, Hans-Joachim;"For many years, Greg Clark was mainly known amongst economic historians for two things – his devasting book reviews are as witty as they are insightful. He also invented a signature recipe for academic articles. Start with a fresh puzzle. Chop some theory and carefully knead into puzzle. Gently squeeze some data and mix well. Garnish with a racy dressing of Cambridge-honed essay-writing skills, while stirring the pot. Then, turn up the heat and watch how the puzzle slowly mushrooms into an ever larger paradox. Wrap into some mystery and serve as is.

Given these two proclivities, news that Greg Clark was writing a book caused a bit of a stir. There were those who expected that the right to review the book would be auctioned off on Ebay, with high bids by Graham Snooks and the friends of Walt Rostow. Others predicted that a book by Greg would turn into a mega-mystery maze manuscript – one out of which the author himself could not possibly emerge with proofs in hand.";2008;Clark's intellectual Sudoku;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Waldenström, Daniel; Frey, Bruno S.";This paper analyzes and compares different ways of assessing how people perceived impending threats of war in the past. Conventional Nordic historiography of World War II claims there were few, if any, people in the Nordic countries who perceived a significantly increased threat of war between 1938 and early 1940. At the same time, historical methods face problems when it comes to capturing the often tacitly held beliefs of a large number of people in the past. In this paper, we analyze these assessments by looking at sudden shifts in sovereign debt yields and spreads in the Nordic bond markets at that time. Our results suggest that Nordic contemporaries indeed perceived significant war risk increases around the time of major war-related geopolitical events. While these findings question some—but not all—of standard Nordic World War II historiography, they also demonstrate the value of analyzing historical market prices to reassess the often tacitly held views and opinions of large groups of people in the past.;2008;Did nordic countries recognize the gathering storm of World War II?

Wallis, Patrick H.;This article reexamines the economics of premodern apprenticeship in England. I present new data showing that a high proportion of apprenticeships in seventeenth-century London ended before the term of service was finished. I then propose a new account of how training costs and repayments were distributed over the apprenticeship contract such that neither master nor apprentice risked significant loss from early termination. This new account fits both the characteristics of premodern apprenticeship and what is known about the acquisition of skills in modern and premodern societies.;2008;Apprenticeship and Training in Premodern England;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Wallis, Patrick H.;This article examines the early development of specialized retail shops in early modern London. It argues that apothecaries' shops were sites of innovative shop design and display. These practices were responses to attitudes to consumption, the problematic nature of the medical commodities which apothecaries sold, and, particularly, contemporary concerns about their reliability, trustworthiness, and honesty. The article concludes that analyses of the rise of the shop need to be revised to incorporate early developments by producer-retailers, such as apothecaries and goldsmiths, and suggests that investments in retailing were driven more by worries about commodities than enticing customers.;2008;Consumption, retailing, and medicine in early-modern London;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
WANDSCHNEIDER, KIRSTEN;Economic historians have devoted enormous attention to the collapse of the interwar gold standard. This article proposes a discrete time duration model (using a panel data set of 24 countries for 1928–1936) to analyze how economic and political indicators affected a country's term on the gold standard. High per capita income, international creditor status, and prior hyperinflation increased the probability of continuation. In contrast, democratic regimes left early. Unemployment, sterling group membership, higher inflation, and the experience of banking crises reduced the time a country remained on the gold standard. This study also predicts sample countries' survival probabilities.;2008;The Stability of the Interwar Gold Exchange Standard: Did Politics Matter?;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Wang, Ta-Chen;New England experienced a significant economic transformation after the Revolutionary War. Despite an extensive literature on American development, little is known about the precise role of banks in this process. This article exploits a detailed dataset from Plymouth County, Massachusetts to show that the first bank during its early stage was far more selective in lending than the pre-existing personal credit market. Thus the mere introduction of a single bank did not broaden access to credit. Following the liberalization of chartering policy in the 1820s, however, freer entry and competition drove banks to extend credit to farmers and artisans.;2008;Banks, Credit Markets, and Early American Development: A Case Study of Entry and Competition;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Wang, Ta-Chen;The birth of commercial banking in New England after the American Revolution provides an important case to examine banking development under asymmetric information. Similar to credit markets in developing countries today, bank borrowers of early America usually had little or no collateral. This paper uses a unique data set based on loans between 1803 and 1833 for Plymouth Bank to examine bank lending policies in the absence of collateral. Empirical evidence suggests that borrowers with little collateral established their credit-worthiness through repeated interaction with banks.;2008;Paying back to borrow more: Reputation and bank credit access in early America;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Williamson, Jeffrey G.;W. Arthur Lewis argued that a new international economic order emerged between 1870 and 1913, and that global terms of trade forces produced rising primary product specialization and de-industrialization in the poor periphery. More recently, modern economists argue that volatility reduces growth in the poor periphery. This article assesses these de-industrialization and volatility forces between 1782 and 1913 during the Great Divergence. First, it argues that the new economic order had been firmly established by 1870, and that the transition took place in the century before, not after. Second, evidence from 1870–1939 confirms that while terms of trade improvements raised long-run growth in the rich core, they did not do so in the poor periphery. Given that the secular terms of trade boom, and thus de-industrialization, was much bigger in the poor periphery before 1870 than after, one might plausibly infer that it might help explain the Great Divergence. Third, growth-reducing terms of trade volatility also contributed to the Great Divergence. Terms of trade volatility was much greater in the poor periphery than the core before 1870. It was still very big after 1870, certainly far bigger than in the core. Based on evidence drawn from 1870–2000, we know that such volatility lowers long-run growth in the poor periphery, and that the negative impact is big. Since terms of trade volatility in the poor periphery was even bigger before 1870, one might plausibly infer that it also helps explain the Great Divergence before 1870.;2008;Globalization and the Great Divergence: terms of trade booms, volatility and the poor periphery, 1782-1913;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
WOLF, NIKOLAUS;The paper examines the timing of exit from the interwar gold-exchange standard for a panel of European countries, based on monthly data over the period January 1928–December 1936. I show that exit from gold can be understood in terms of a trade-off between a limited set of factors commonly suggested in the theoretical literature on currency crises. A simple and parsimonious econometric framework that nests various hypotheses allows me to predict the month of exit in the 1930s, except for France. I consider the separate cases of France and Poland to show my results shed light on country-specific debates.;2008;Scylla and Charybdis.

Abildgren, Kim;This article traces links between the monetary regime and some institutions of the labour market in Denmark over the past century. The results indicate that elements of the labour market are endogenous. The longest wage contract terms are found towards the end of the pre-World War I classical gold standard period – characterised by price-level stability – and during the period since the mid 1990s that has seen a firm fixed exchange-rate policy and low and stable inflation. The shortest contract lengths are observed in the interwar period with high inflation volatility. Inflation indexation of wages was used most extensively in the Bretton Woods period and during the soft peg period of the 1970s when inflation was high and rising. The degree of nominal wage rigidity in the economy is therefore not necessarily approximately constant, as it is otherwise assumed in many New Keynesian models.;2009;Monetary regimes and the endogeneity of labour market structures: empirical evidence from Denmark, 1875-2007;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Accominotti, O.;French reserves policy during the interwar years has been heavily criticised because of its consequences for other countries. This article presents new monthly data on the Bank of France's foreign reserves currency composition between 1928 and 1936, and identifies the motivations behind reserves policy. The Bank of France's aim was to limit the risk of capital loss on its foreign portfolio. The determining factor in its portfolio allocation decisions was the credibility of reserves currencies on the exchange market. Credibility issues explain both the sale of pounds against dollars during 1929 and 1930 and the massive conversion of foreign holdings into gold from 1931 on. However, due to the huge volume of its reserves, the Bank also had to consider the effects of its own actions on the market. Its cooperative attitude towards sterling in the months before British devaluation can be explained through its market position. The Bank of France's portfolio choice was that of a large player in a low-credibility international monetary system.;2009;The sterling trap: foreign reserves management at the Bank of France, 1928-1936;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

In addition to calculating capital appreciation and dividend yields, the article also estimates the effect of survivorship bias on returns. Three notable findings emerge from this study. First, stock market returns in the 1825-1870 period are broadly similar for Britain and the United States, although the British market is less risky. Second, real returns in the 1825-1870 period are higher than in subsequent epochs of British history.

We use this “age heaping” to measure cognitive ability in quantitative reasoning, or “numeracy.” We construct a database of age heaping estimates with exceptional geographic and temporal coverage, and demonstrate a robust correlation of literacy and numeracy, where both can be observed. Extending the temporal and geographic range of our knowledge of human capital, we show that Western Europe had already diverged from the east and reached high numeracy levels by 1600, long before the rise of mass schooling or the onset of industrialization.;2009;Quantifying Quantitative Literacy: Age Heaping and the History of Human Capital;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Allen, Douglas W.;Between c. 1550 –c. 1880, a small group of individuals ruled England and oversaw her transformation from a small country to the British Empire—and in the process they became exceedingly wealthy. Known as aristocrats, their unusual lifestyles were the antithesis of modern secular values. Today aristocrats are often viewed as a hindrance to pre-modern growth and development because they appeared to operate so inefficiently. This paper argues that the aristocrats efficiently provided the valuable service of “trustworthy servant”, by investing their wealth in hostage capital. This theory explains terms of entry and exit out of the aristocracy, the strict family settlement, their education patterns, extravagant lifestyle, and their ultimate voluntary retreat from power.;2009;A theory of the pre-modern British aristocracy;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Allen, Robert C.;The productivity of agriculture in England and the Yangtze Delta are compared c.1620 and c.1820 in order to gauge the performance of the most advanced part of China vis-à-vis its counterpart in Europe. The value of real output is compared using purchasing power parity exchange rates. Output per hectare was nine times greater in the Yangtze Delta than in England. More surprisingly, output per day worked was about 90 per cent of the English performance. This put Yangtze farmers slightly behind English and Dutch farmers c.1820, but ahead of most other farmers in Europe?an impressive achievement. There was little change in Yangtze agricultural productivity between 1620 and 1820. In 1820, the real income of a Yangtze peasant family was also about the same as that of an English agricultural labourer. All was not rosy in the Yangtze, however, for incomes there were on a downward trajectory. Agriculture income per family declined between 1620 and 1820, even though income per day worked changed little since population growth led to smaller farms and fewer days worked per year. The real earnings of women in textile production also declined, since the relative price of cotton cloth dropped?possibly also because a larger population led to greater production. The implication is that the Yangtze family, unlike the English family, had a considerably higher real income c.1620, and that period was the Delta's golden age.;2009;Agricultural productivity and rural incomes in England and the Yangtze Delta, c.1620–c.1820;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Allen, Robert C.;The spinning jenny helps explain why the Industrial Revolution occurred in Britain rather than in France or India. Wages were exceptionally high relative to capital prices in Britain, so the jenny was profitable to use in Britain but not elsewhere. Since it was only profitable to use the jenny in Britain, that was the only country where it as worth incurring the costs of developing it. Irrespective of the quality of their institutions or the progressiveness of their cultures, neither the French nor the Indians would have found it profitable to mechanize cotton production in the eighteenth century.;2009;The Industrial Revolution in Miniature: The Spinning Jenny in Britain, France, and India;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Alston, Lee J.; Mattiace, Shannan; Nonnenmacher, Tomas";"The henequen boom coincided with the rule of Porfirio Díaz (1876–1911).

As part of the implicit contract with hacendados, peons accumulated large debts at the time of marriage, most of which were never repaid. We argue that the debts bound workers to the hacienda as part of a system of paternalism and that more productive workers incurred more debt. We examine the institutional setting in which debt operated and stress the formal and informal institutional contexts within which hacendados and workers negotiated contracts.

While earlier scholars have ascribed a central role to mechanization, Olmstead and Rhode argue that dramatic biological gains were made by an army of improving farmers responding to the challenges of insect pests, biological pathogens, new soils and movement into new climatic zones. These gains remained largely hidden because of the way most statistics have been presented and discussed.

Battilossi, Stefano;In interwar Italy, at least six major episodes of banking crises required the intervention of monetary authorities to bail out, restructure, or liquidate distressed intermediaries. The five large universal banks rescued in the systemic crisis of 1930?1 jointly accounted for one-third of the total assets of the banking system. What made Italian leading banks so prone to crises? This article suggests that their fragility was ultimately caused by governance failures, both public and private, that enhanced excess risk-taking. Empirical evidence is consistent with theoretical insights according to which the potential for moral hazard and conflict of interest, endemic in universal banking, can be magnified when banks enter into long-run relationships with firms and base their growth strategy on the pursuance of monopolistic rents. Interwar Italy emerges as a case in which an insider system devoid of the disciplinary devices provided by sound governance institutions created perverse incentives and weakened the resilience of the banking system to adverse macroeconomic shocks.;2009;Did governance fail universal banks?

"Baubeau, Patrice; Cazelles, Bernard";Although 50 years of scientific work has been invested in building retrospective economic time series, their reliability is still debated, a good example being the two competing nineteenth century French GNP series. Instead of trying to bring up some new details to gauge their respective accuracy, we propose a different route, i.e. testing the intrinsic features of these two series, in absolute terms first, then by benchmarking them to a non-retrospective time series. In order to do that, we rely on new mathematical tools—wavelet spectrum analysis—developed in signal processing. This leads to a new approach, which separates the accuracy of a series between amplitude and time variations, and brings nuanced conclusions as to which of the two series tested is the best: indeed, since a trade-off is almost inescapable between the two criterions of accuracy, the statistical quality of one retrospective time series tends to linger either on one side (amplitude level) or the other (time variations). Our study also shows that variance distribution along the time axis is a good proxy for complex retrospective series accuracy.;2009;French economic cycles: a wavelet analysis of French retrospective GNP series;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

I also find evidence that nationalizations reduced mileage growth. The results suggest that external military threats increased the appeal of nationalizations, while legal and political institutions influenced their costs.

Boldorf, M.;There is a lively ongoing debate, led by Stephen Epstein and Sheilagh Ogilvie, about the economic effects of institutions (particularly guilds) on the pre-industrial economies. The focus of the controversy is an article published by Ogilvie in which she points out that there is a new trend, as Epstein puts it, a ‘modern consensus’, aimed at the ‘rehabilitation of guilds’. Based on her study of the Württemberg worsted industry and supplemented with a variety of examples from all over Europe, she develops a theoretical framework outlining the reasons for the economic inefficiency of the guilds. She challenges the view that guilds had a tangible effect on market failures with regard to (1) product quality, (2) innovation and (3) training. She also examines (4) the link between guilds and social capital. This article suggests that the first two issues are the most relevant for an analysis of the economic effects of the activities of the Silesian merchant guilds on regional growth in the eighteenth century. The focal point of this argument is the difference between craft guilds and merchant guilds and thus refers back to the earliest studies by Ogilvie on corporative institutions.;2009;Socio-economic institutions and transaction costs: merchant guilds and rural trade in eighteenth-century Lower Silesia;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

A data set is constructed, consisting of all English Poor Law Unions in 1891?2, and regression equations are estimated in order to explain variations across unions in pauperism rates. This is followed by the testing of several conjectures made by contemporaries, and repeated by historians, regarding the deterrent effect of workhouse relief, the effects of wages and of the industrial character of Poor Law Unions on pauperism rates, and regional differences in workers' reliance on the poor law.

However, the completion of the process was delayed until after the Napoleonic Wars by increasing raw cotton costs, before supply adjusted to the major increase in demand for inputs.;2009;Lancashire, India, and shifting competitive advantage in cotton textiles, 1700–1850: the neglected role of factor prices;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Rising production after the middle of the fifteenth century probably resulted from lower book prices and higher literacy.

Carson, Scott Alan;Using a new source of nineteenth century US state prison records I contrast the biological living conditions of comparable African-Americans and whites. Although blacks and whites today in the US reach similar terminal statures, nineteenth century African-American statures were consistently shorter than those of whites. Greater insolation (vitamin D production) is shown to be associated with taller black and white statures and a considerable share of the stature difference between US blacks and whites was attributable to insolation and vitamin D production. Black statures increased during the antebellum period, while white statures declined. Black and white statures both decreased after the Civil War. Farmers were taller than workers in other occupations, and an alternative explanation for stature variation by social class is considered.;2009;Geography, insolation, and vitamin D in nineteenth century US African-American and white statures;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"CARUS, A. W.; OGILVIE, SHEILAGH";Many historians reject quantitative methods as inappropriate to understanding past societies. This article argues that no sharp distinction between qualitative and quantitative concepts can be drawn, as almost any concept used to describe a past society is implicitly quantitative. Many recent advances in understanding have been achieved by deriving quantitative evidence from qualitative evidence, using the two dialectically, and indexing them against other quantitative findings from the same population. We show that this triangulation method can be extended to many apparently qualitative sources. Despite its successes, the potential of turning qualitative into quantitative evidence has only just begun to be exploited.;2009;Turning qualitative into quantitative evidence: a well-used method made explicit;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
CERRETANO, VALERIO;This article describes how the Trade Facilities Act and the liquidation of certain government-owned assets spurred the industrial intervention of the Bank of England in the 1920s. What emerges is that the Treasury had a much greater role in the Bank of England's industrial intervention than has been hitherto suggested. This article places the theme of the Bank of England's industrial intervention within broader discussions about Treasury history and Britain's postwar reconstruction, and refines the argument that the original involvement of the Bank of England with industry merely represented an extension of its prewar operations of branch banking and its duties as a central bank.;2009;The Treasury, Britain's postwar reconstruction, and the industrial intervention of the Bank of England, 1921–91;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
CHAMBERS, DAVID;Allegations of British capital market failure are numerous, but frequently contentious. This paper revisits the literature by highlighting the post-1945 market for initial public offerings (IPOs) as a clear instance of capital market failure. Despite the tender method delivering substantially lower underpricing than the traditional fixed-price offer method, it was adopted by only one in 10 firms going public. This missed opportunity cost issuing firms between £1.7 billion and £3.5 billion in real proceeds forgone between 1960 and 1986, excluding privatizations, and was symptomatic of a lack of competition in equity underwriting before Big Bang.;2009;Gentlemanly capitalism revisited: a case study of the underpricing of initial public offerings on the London Stock Exchange, 1946–86;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Chaudhary, Latika;Using a new historical data set on the availability of schools, I analyze why there was so little primary education in British India, where as late as 1911 there were fewer than three primary schools for every ten villages. The findings show that greater caste and religious diversity contributed to both low and misguided private spending. Indeed more diverse districts had fewer privately managed primary schools and a smaller ratio of primary to secondary schools. Given primary schools were correlated with subsequent literacy, local factors that disrupted primary school provision had important consequences for India's limited achievement in basic education.;2009;Determinants of Primary Schooling in British India;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
COLLANTES, FERNANDO;Agriculture is no longer the main sector in the economy of rural Europe. Based on a comparative analysis of nine upland areas from five different countries (Scotland, Switzerland, France, Italy, and Spain), this article argues that, contrary to the claims of most social science work on ?rural restructuring?, the decline of agriculture in the rural economy should be understood from a long-term perspective and in relation to European industrialization, rather than as a recent process linked to postmodern dynamics. In fact, widely diverging paths of rural change during industrialization similarly imply occupational change.;2009;Rural Europe reshaped: the economic transformation of upland regions, 1850–2000;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Crettez, Bertrand; Deloche, Régis";In Rome, on 16 March 1978, the Red Brigades kidnapped Aldo Moro. They kept him a prisoner for 55 days, and ultimately killed him. Why did they decide to kill Moro since it appears a posteriori that they did not improve their situation by doing so? Our paper answers this question by building mainly on the model of kidnapping by Selten (A simple game model of kidnapping. In: Henn R, Moeschlin O (eds) Mathematical economics and game theory. Lecture Notes in Economics and Mathematical Systems, vol. 141. Springer, Berlin, pp 139–156, 1977). We develop an integrated game-theoretic model that reliably captures both the problem of kidnapping for some sort of non-monetary ransom and the problem of assassination of prominent political figures. We embed our model within the historical evidence surrounding the Moro case. We show that, in the Moro case, there is a continuum of equilibria implying the death of the hostage.;2009;A cliometric analysis of the Aldo Moro kidnapping and assassination;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Cubel, A.; Sanchis, M. T.";During the ‘Golden Age’, the high investment rates reached by the European countries have been considered crucial in explaining growth. The literature about the Golden Age has emphasized supply-side explanations based on structural change, the reconstruction effort and the catch-up hypothesis, but also demand-side explanations focused on the effects of demand stability for promoting high rates of investment. In this article we have focused our attention on the evolution of the user cost of capital for explaining the high rates of investment. Our hypothesis is that the increase in investment rates was propelled by the decline in the user cost of capital, the consequence largely of the drop in the relative price of machinery. The embodiment of new technology and the reductions in trade barriers explain this decrease in the relative price of machinery.;2009;Investment and growth in Europe during the Golden Age;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
DAVIS, GAYLE;The history of vital registration has attracted substantial attention from both social historians and historical demographers. While much of that research has touched upon issues of fertility and mortality, the contentious issue of the stillborn child?which falls somewhere between the two?has been largely neglected. Although civil birth and death registration was introduced to Scotland in 1855, stillbirth registration did not begin until 1939. Using a range of legal, medical, and statistical evidence, this article explores the history of stillbirth registration in Scotland from a social history perspective. It outlines the problems associated with lack of stillbirth registration, the processes that eventually led to registration of the stillborn child, and the wider significance of that registration.;2009;Stillbirth registration and perceptions of infant death, 1900–60: the Scottish case in national context;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Dennis, Benjamin N.; İşcan, Talan B.";In the last two centuries, the reallocation of labor out of agriculture has been a dominant feature of structural change and economic growth in the United States. This paper uses an accounting framework founded in economic theory to decompose this reallocation into three components: a demand-side effect due to the low income elasticity of demand for agricultural goods (Engel effect), and two supply-side effects, one due to differential sectoral productivity growth rates (Baumol effect), and the other to differential capital deepening. The results show that the Engel effect accounts for almost all labor reallocation until the 1950s, after which the Baumol effect becomes a key determinant. Our framework provides a unified account of long-run structural change, and demonstrates that historical interpretations and theoretical models that emphasize only one dimension of this process cannot properly account for the dramatic history of labor reallocation in the United States.;2009;Engel versus Baumol: Accounting for structural change using two centuries of U.S. data;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Drelichman, Mauricio;The Mesta was the association of the migratory shepherds of Castile, controlling fine wool production between the thirteenth and the nineteenth centuries. Its royally granted privileges have often been blamed for the stagnant Spanish agricultural productivity during the early modern period. I argue that the Mesta’s privileges allowed Medieval Castile to develop its comparative advantage in wool, and that the Crown was able to restrict their scope and application when economic conditions favored arable farming interests. I support my argument with extensive archival data, including a new series of wool prices and a detailed analysis of lawsuits involving the Mesta.;2009;License to till: The privileges of the Spanish Mesta as a case of second-best institutions;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Dribe, M.;This article studies the importance of demand and supply factors in the Swedish fertility transition using county-level data and panel regressions. Fertility started to decline around 1880 when marital fertility began a continuous decline. A gradual diffusion of parity-specific control was important in this process. The fertility of the oldest age groups declined fastest, even though the decline started in all age groups over 25 at about the same time. This development was connected to broader socioeconomic and demographic processes of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, such as mortality decline, urbanisation, industrialisation and expansion of education.;2009;Demand and supply factors in the fertility transition: a county-level analysis of age-specific marital fertility in Sweden, 1880-1930;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Dupont, Brandon R.;Nearly every previous study of the 1893 bank panic acknowledges its regional concentration in the Western states yet few provide any in-depth study of what caused such a distinct regional pattern. Here, I recast the 1893 crisis as having its origins in agricultural markets and then spreading to Western banks that were highly exposed to agricultural shocks. Negative shocks to agricultural yields and the relative importance of the wheat crop for specific states emerge as important explanations for the regional pattern of bank closures and thus for the panic itself.;2009;Panic in the plains: agricultural markets and the panic of 1893;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Eichengreen, Barry; Flandreau, Marc";Foreign exchange reserves have assumed considerable importance in the ongoing debate over risks to the international financial system and how it should be reformed in the wake of the great global credit crisis of 2008. The worry is that China's accumulation of foreign exchange reserves and the associated global imbalances were a factor setting the stage for the crisis. The worry for the future is that the country's huge volume of dollar reserves and the incentive this provides for portfolio diversification have disturbing implications for the stability of the dollar. One manifestation of the interest that the media and policy makers have taken in this topic is the frequency of references to ‘historical lessons’ that shed light on possible future developments. For example, one finds frequent reference to how the pound sterling was dethroned by the dollar as the leading international reserve currency and to the implications of this historical episode for what might happen next.;2009;A Special Issue of the European Review of Economic History: Guest Editors' Introduction;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The Swedish and British domestic producers operated under more efficient institutions and thus had to settle for more moderate rents.

"Esteves, Rui Pedro; KHOUDOUR-CASTÉRAS, DAVID";While the pre-1914 mass migrations have been widely studied, the related pattern of emigrants' remittances is still largely untouched. This article aims at filling this gap by analyzing the contribution of remittances to financial stability. In the optimum currency area theory, labor mobility can ease the adjustment mechanism for countries under fixed exchange rate regimes. We confirm this claim by showing that emigrants' remittances reduced the incidence of financial disturbances among a sample of emerging economies characterized by substantial emigration. This result underscores the benefits for emerging economies from opening up to international factor flows, despite the associated financial turbulence.“A fantastic rain of gold.” Thus observers in the decades between the nineteenth and the twentieth century described the influx of capital toward Italy generated by emigration remittances. These flows were spread piecemeal across the countryside of the entire peninsula, especially into the poorest regions of marginal mountain agriculture.;2009;A Fantastic Rain of Gold: European Migrants' Remittances and Balance of Payments Adjustment During the Gold Standard Period;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

This paper shows how it was possible to secure currency stability, despite a lower credibility for the peg and a higher incidence of gold point violations than in core countries. The explanation lies in the central role played by institutional actors, such as the Bank of Portugal and/or the government, whose interventions in the exchange market kept the parity within the band.;2009;Market Integration in the Golden Periphery.

"Flandreau, Marc; Flores Zendejas, Juan H.";"How does sovereign debt emerge? In the early nineteenth century, intermediaries' market power and prestige served to overcome information asymmetries. Relying on insights from finance theory, we argue that capitalists turned to intermediaries' reputations to guide their investment strategies. Intermediaries could in turn commit or else they would lose market share. This sustained the development of sovereign debt. This new perspective is backed by archival evidence and empirical data, and it suggests why strong but undemocratic states could borrow.

Petty's archive makes clear what a large part Ireland played in his writings, and it is suggested that this preoccupation is essential to an appreciation of him as an economist. It also demonstrates the point that Petty was not principally a theorist but rather a practical political economist whose schemes for the enrichment of the king's dominions were inspired by the underdevelopment which he experienced at first hand in Ireland.;2009;Sir William Petty, Ireland, and the making of a political economist, 1653–87;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Goldberg, Dror;"Modern currency originates in the inconvertible, legal tender paper money that Massachusetts devised in 1690. The circumstances that led to its creation are more complex than the typical story of wartime specie shortage. Due to temporary political constraints of that turbulent period, the currency could be neither backed by land nor imposed on anyone, as was then standard. Instead, it had to be disguised from England as a simple, private-seeming IOU. By pleasing both its pay-demanding troops and England, the government maximized its probability of survival subject to the constraints.

GOODARE, JULIAN;James VI (1567?1625) was chronically indebted, and this caused him frequent problems. This article presents two series of systematic data that together indicate the main contours of his indebtedness: (1) end-of-year deficits, and (2) hived-off debts which the Crown left unpaid for long periods (sometimes permanently). The hived-off debts, reconstructed individually, constitute a narrative of fiscal policy-making. Instead of a large and catastrophic bankruptcy, James in effect had numerous small bankruptcies. He benefited from an emerging structure of Scottish domestic credit. He eventually repaid many of his debts after succeeding to the English throne in 1603.;2009;The debts of James VI of Scotland;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Hatase, Mariko; Ohnuki, M.";Historical experience is often invoked in the modern debate on competition among reserve currencies, yet little is known about quantitative aspects or institutional features of reserve management. By drawing on newly obtained data on foreign exchange reserves, especially those broken down by currency, this article explores the competition between the British pound sterling and the US dollar for the status of leading reserve currency in Japan during the interwar period. We find that competition between these two currencies remained undecided and that their relative status alternated repeatedly. Historical materials and the results of econometric analysis suggest that the key factors explaining a choice of reserve currencies are trade volumes and the currency denomination of external debt. The latter criteria supported maintaining sterling's status as a reserve currency for the interwar period, reflecting its considerable share in debt service generated through issues that had been launched when London was the sole international market. The stability of potential reserve currencies is shown to be crucial as well. We also find evidence of institutional factors, which include taxation, foreign exchange controls and restrictions on financial activities.;2009;Did the structure of trade and foreign debt affect reserve currency composition?

"Horrell, Sara; Meredith, David; Oxley, Deborah";This paper investigates the proposition made by contemporaries that women and children disproportionately bore the brunt of industrialisation and urbanisation by examining how poor working-class families in mid-Victorian London shared their resources. Allocation is inferred from independently pooled cross-sectional data on the height, weight and body mass of 32,584 prisoners from a London House of Correction. As boys and girls moved into adulthood, they made some biological gains consistent with ‘catch up’ on earlier deprivation. The body masses of women and men then diverged. When families grew, women shrank. When children left home taking their wages with them, when age reduced the earning capacities of herself and her husband, women suffered even more, becoming dangerously underweight in older age.

"Humphries, Jane; Leuning, Timothy";"A new source, 1840s Admiralty seamen's tickets, is used to explore three anthropometric issues. First, did being born in a city, with its associated disamenities, lead to stunting? Second, did being born near a city, whose markets sucked away foodstuffs, lead to stunting? Third, did child labour lead to stunting? We find that only those born in very large cities suffered a level of stunting that contemporaries could have observed. Being born near a city, which gave parents opportunities to trade away family calories, and perhaps increased exposure to disease, did not cause stunting. Britain was a well-integrated market; all families, whatever their locations, had options to trade and faced similar disease environments. Finally, although adults who had gone to sea young were shorter than those who did not enlist until fully grown, going to sea did not stunt. Instead, plentiful food at sea attracted stunted adolescents, who reversed most of their stunting as a result. But child labour at sea was different from other forms of children's work because wages were largely hypothecated to the child as food and shelter onboard. In contrast, where wages were paid to the child or his parents in cash, they became submerged in the household economy and their benefits were shared with other family members.";2009;Cities, market integration, and going to sea: stunting and the standard of living in early nineteenth-century England and Wales;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Humphries, Jane; Leuning, Timothy";"Using a new source of evidence we explore the mobility of mid-nineteenth century seamen. Among seamen born outside London, the tall, the literate and those who could remember the exact day, month and year when they were born, characteristics that we suggest mark them out as men with more choices in life, were more likely to migrate to London. Contrary to what might be inferred from contemporary descriptions of urban disamenities or from persistent differentials in mortality, London appears as a desirable destination for those who could choose. The conclusion must be that London was not so bad, and we should adjust our perception of the problems of urbanisation accordingly, with implications for the wider debate on the standard of living during the industrial revolution. The paper’s methodological interest is the use of height as an explanatory variable in the analysis of migration. Although correlated with other variables that are routinely used in anthropometric studies to indicate life chances, such as literacy and the ability to know and recall date of birth, height has empirical advantages over these alternatives in that it exhibits higher levels of significance. Moreover while literacy and heaping are in essence binary variables, height is a (near) continuous one, and one that allows us to test for linear and non-linear responses, as we do with interesting results in this paper. Perhaps the most fruitful use of height in historical analyses may turn out to be as an explanatory variable; at the very least such a research strategy provides anthropometric historians with further opportunities.";2009;Was Dick Whittington taller than those he left behind?

IRIGOIN, MARIA ALEJANDRA;This article deals with the political economic consequences of the disappearance of the Spanish silver peso standard in Spanish America, the longest monetary union that ever existed. With the Napoleonic invasion of Spain in 1808, the fiscal and political structure of the empire imploded and most colonies became independent. Regional competition for revenues exacerbated budget shortfalls driven by military expenditure. Local elites established in former colonial Treasury districts started highly diverse monetary experiments to procure funds. Those in control of mint houses started minting their own coins or debased existing silver currency. Elsewhere, inconvertible paper currency was also created to meet budget deficits. As a result, the most valuable feature of the Spanish American silver peso, its quality standard, was broken and the standard that had organized the early modern international economy for more than 300 years ceased to exist altogether. In Spanish America, as diverse monies co-existed within a formerly highly integrated economic space, a widespread Gresham's law effect exacerbated the conflict among local and regional elites. This fostered the political fragmentation of colonial Spanish America into an increasing number of political and monetary sovereign entities during the nineteenth century.;2009;Gresham on horseback: the monetary roots of Spanish American political fragmentation in the nineteenth century;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Jobst, Clemens;This article challenges the conventional view that the gold standard was stabilized by quasi-automatic central bank intervention and/or private arbitrage whenever the spot exchange rate reached the ‘gold points’. New archival evidence on the central bank of Austria–Hungary between 1896 and 1913 documents the use of sophisticated instruments such as foreign exchange forward and repo (sale-repurchase) contracts and a quest for market dominance both with respect to reserves held and the share in market turnover. The resulting change in the working of the foreign exchange market is shown to have supported the conduct of monetary policy, underlining the importance of market micro structure in the design and conduct of monetary policy. The picture that emerges is that of a much more ‘modern’ approach to exchange rate stabilization during the classical gold standard than is traditionally recognized.;2009;Market leader: the Austro-Hungarian Bank and the making of foreign exchange intervention, 1896-1913;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Kauppila, Jari;This paper provides a quantification of the relative importance of export industries in a small open economy using new data provided by input–output tables describing the Finnish economy in 1928. The Finnish analysis of the Great Depression of the 1930s has been particularly focused on the importance of foreign trade. Despite the lack of quantified evidence, it is commonly accepted that the export industries had a major role in the economic development. The basic input–output framework is extended into a production–consumption model to produce a more elaborate model that provides a quantification of changes in final demand of some key industries in the economy. Results suggest that even though the role of export industries was dominant, domestic market industries and private consumption also had a significant role in the depression.;2009;Quantifying the relative importance of export industries in a small open economy during the great depression of the 1930s: an input–output approach;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

An econometric model of the freight rate market is estimated on monthly data from the 1850s. It is found that harvest failures, business cycles, the supply of tonnage and the Crimean War all significantly affected freight rates in this period.

Lampe, Markus;This study contributes to a revised picture of nineteenth-century bilateralism. Employing a new disaggregated data set, it argues that bilateral treaties did not implement general free trade, but instead reduced tariffs unevenly through commodity-specific preferences, especially favoring manufactured goods. Gravity model estimates show that specific liberalizations increased exports of corresponding items, but not overall trade. Exporters from countries whose governments used bilateralism strategically to bring down partner tariffs benefitted most. Hence, the network in form and outcome is more properly identified with reciprocal liberalization practiced by the French than with British free-trade ideology.;2009;Effects of Bilateralism and the MFN Clause on International Trade: Evidence for the Cobden-Chevalier Network, 1860-1875;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Lange, Fabian; Olmstead, Alan L.; Rhode, Paul W.";The boll weevil is America's most celebrated agricultural pest. We analyze new county-level panel data to provide sharp estimates of the time path of the insect's effects on the southern economy. We find that in anticipation of the contact, farmers increased production, attempting to squeeze out one last large crop.

LEWIS, ROBERT;In this article, it is argued that the North American industrial district was a metropolitan-centred one that drew extensively on regional resources, skills, capital, and information. The Chicago printing industry between 1880 and 1950 is used as a case study to demonstrate that industries were linked at various scales: from the factory district to the metropolis and the region. A wide range of sources (manufacturing censuses, government reports, industrial journals, bankruptcy records) is employed to establish how the intricate set of relations and transactions formed metropolitan industrial districts.;2009;Industrial districts and manufacturing linkages: Chicago's printing industry, 1880–1950;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Lindberg, Erik;"This article uses club theory to explain why two major medieval commercial centres declined in the early modern period. Lübeck and Danzig illuminate the difficulties experienced by old-style European towns where early modern guilds (and other privileged ?corporations?) had a lot of political influence in making the transition to the new style of north-west European cities such as Amsterdam and Hamburg. The article refutes theories proposing that the special privileges awarded to a merchant elite enhanced economic growth; instead, it is argued that those privileges gave rise to ?club goods? that were beneficial only to a small number of merchants and were provided at the expense of society at large, resulting in economic decline.";2009;Club goods and inefficient institutions: why Danzig and Lübeck failed in the early modern period;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Ljungberg, Jonas; Nilsson, Anders";This paper presents newly constructed series on human capital in Sweden 1870–2000. The estimates are based on enrolment in different forms of education, stretching as far back as 1812, and the size and age distribution of the population within age range 15–65 years. The secular accumulation of human capital has closely matched the long-term trend in aggregate productivity and both grew at a rate of 2.4% annually. Our estimates differ significantly from the data attributed to Sweden in the international short-cut estimates of human capital for the period since 1960. The basic question addressed is about causality: whether human capital causes economic growth or if causality goes in the other direction. We address this problem with modified Granger-causality tests. According to our results, changes in the stock of human capital have in a systematic way preceded changes in aggregate productivity up to the structural crisis in the 1970s. This allows us to conclude that human capital has been a causal factor in Swedish economic growth since the industrialisation. However, after 1975, the growth of human capital has not been able to match the demands of the third industrial revolution.;2009;Human capital and economic growth: Sweden 1870–2000;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Logan, Trevon D.;Using both IPUMS and the Colored Troops Sample of the Civil War Union Army Data, I estimate the effects of literacy and health on the migration propensities of African-Americans from 1870 to 1910. I find that literacy and health shocks were strong predictors of migration and the stock of health was not. There were differential selection propensities based on slave status—former slaves were less likely to migrate given a specific health shock than free blacks. Counterfactuals suggest that as much as 35% of the difference in the mobility patterns of former slaves and free blacks is explained by differences in their human capital, and more than 20% of that difference is due to health alone. Overall, the selection effect of literacy on migration is reduced by one-tenth to one-third once health is controlled for. The low levels of human capital accumulation and rates of mobility for African-Americans after the Civil War are partly explained by the poor health status of slaves and their immediate descendants.;2009;Health, human capital, and African-American migration before 1910;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Logan, Trevon D.;According to conventional income measures, American and British industrial workers in the late nineteenth century were two to four times as wealthy as those in developing countries today. Estimated calorie expenditure elasticities of American and British industrial workers based on the 1888 Cost of Living Survey are greater than calorie elasticity estimates for developing countries today, which suggest that yesterday's wealthy workers were hungrier than today's poor. The result is robust to numerous criticisms. The finding implies an extraordinary improvement in nutritional well-being among the poor in the last century that has not been captured by our income estimates.;2009;The Transformation of Hunger: The Demand for Calories Past and Present;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
McGranahan, Leslie;Researchers and commentators have compared men and women’s charitable giving patterns and have concluded that one sex was more generous than the other. Most research based on modern data has found women to be more philanthropic than men. In this article, I compare charitable donations of unmarried men and women in a sample of wills from 17th Century England. I find that men are more likely to make donations than women and make larger average donations. This difference in giving can be explained by differences in wealth and family structure and should not be ascribed to differences in charitable impulses.;2009;The widow’s offering: Inheritance, family structure, and the charitable gifts of women;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Mills, Terence C.;This paper provides a retrospective on the modelling of trends and cycles in economic time series and considers where the research agenda currently stands and where future developments might lie. A brief survey of the early empirical research on trends and cycles is first provided before attention is focused on four papers published in 1961—our ‘annus mirabilis’ of trend and cycle modelling—which we argue have been ‘prime movers’ in various aspects of research in this area. The links from these papers to current research issues are then teased out before the likely future directions of research in both theoretical and applied aspects of the modelling of trends and cycles are considered.;2009;Modelling trends and cycles in economic time series: historical perspective and future developments;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

We find evidence that technological innovations and institutional changes played an important role in creating a national capital market in Japan. In particular, the diffusion in the use of the telegraph, the growth in commercial branch banking networks, and the development of Bank of Japan's branches reduced interest rate differentials.

Moor, T. de;Despite the wide application of the metaphor of ?the tragedy of the commons?, there is little historical literature that points to the weaknesses of its historical basis. There is, however, sufficient qualitative and quantitative evidence to prove that commons were well regulated and organized in order to achieve a sustainable management, that also took into account the needs and wishes of its commoners. This case study of a common in Flanders looks at the evidence for this in the eighteenth century, examining bookkeeping and other archival sources.

Moradi, Alexander;This study presents fresh evidence on nutrition and health in colonial Kenya by using a new and comprehensive data set of African army recruits and civilians and applying a powerful measure of nutritional status: mean population height. Findings demonstrate huge regional inequalities, but only minor changes in the mean height of cohorts born 20 years before and after colonization. From 1920 onwards secular improvements took place, which continued after independence. I conclude that however bad colonial policies and devastating short-term crises were, the net outcome of colonial times was a significant progress in nutrition and health.;2009;Towards an Objective Account of Nutrition and Health in Colonial Kenya: A Study of Stature in African Army Recruits and Civilians, 1880–1980;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Morgan, Stephen L.;Foreign influence on South China increasingly disrupted the economy from the late eighteenth century. Many scholars believe the standard of living fell, while others point to positive gains from increased integration with the world economy. The paper estimates the secular trend in the average height of the southern Chinese in the nineteenth century based on data from prison registers in colonial Australia. Contrary to the pessimist view, height began to decline obviously only from the 1850s, a product of the dislocation effects of revolts and rebellions. At 163–164cm, the Chinese were of similar stature to the military conscripts of some European countries in the early-to-mid nineteenth century.;2009;Stature and economic development in South China, 1810–1880;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

NEWTON, SCOTT;Conventional wisdom is critical of the newly elected Labour government's reaction to external financial difficulties in the autumn of 1964. Anxious about its political position, it avoided the necessary measures, involving stringent deflation and possibly devaluation. This article seeks to revise the traditional view by re-examining the response to what were actually two sterling crises. The first was handled efficiently. The second was provoked by speculation stemming from market expectations of devaluation. The decision not to devalue but seek external support was justifiable, given changes within the international economy which were to create problems for many postwar nation states.;2009;The two sterling crises of 1964 and the decision not to devalue;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Nuvolari, Alessandro; VERSPAGEN, BART";The development of the high-pressure expansive engine represented a watershed in the evolution of steam power technology, allowing the attainment of major fuel economies. In Britain, Cornish engineers took the lead in the exploration of this specific technological trajectory. Notwithstanding its superior fuel efficiency was immediately widely discussed, the high-pressure expansive engine did not find widespread application in other steam-using regions (in particular in Lancashire), where the Watt low-pressure engine continued to be the favourite option.

"O’Rourke, Kevin Hjortshøj; Williamson, Jeffrey G.";This article explores the impact of the ?Voyages of Discovery? on European spice markets, asking whether the exploits of Vasco da Gama and others brought European and Asian spice markets closer together. To this end we compare trends in pepper and fine spice prices before and after 1503, the year when da Gama returned from his financially successful second voyage. Other authors have examined trends in nominal spice prices, but this article uses relative spice prices, that is, accounting for inflation. We find that the Voyages of Discovery had a major impact on European spice markets, and provide a simple model of monopoly and oligopoly to decompose the sources of the Cape route's impact on European markets. Finally, we offer some speculations regarding the impact of the Cape route on intra-European market integration.;2009;Did Vasco da Gama matter for European markets?;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Olmstead, Alan L.;Control of livestock disease had large spillover effects on human health. By 1900 the United States was a leader in livestock disease control, thanks to the efforts of the Bureau of Animal Industry. Its first chief, Daniel Salmon, established a model that would be copied around the world in campaigns against human and animal diseases. For the most part, the Progressive Era regulations to advance livestock health and food safety were spectacular successes.

Pereira, Alvaro S.;"By combining new archival and existing data, this article provides estimates of the economic impact of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, the largest natural catastrophe ever recorded in Europe. The direct cost of the earthquake is estimated to be between 32 and 48 percent of the Portuguese GDP. In spite of strict controls, prices and wages remained volatile in the years after the tragedy. The recovery from the earthquake also led to a rise in the wage premium of construction workers. More significantly, the earthquake became an opportunity to reform the economy and to reduce the economic semi-dependency vis-à-vis Britain.
“ Sometimes miracles are necessary, natural phenomena, or great disasters in order to shake, to awaken, and to open the eyes of misled nations about their interests, [nations] oppressed by others that simulate friendship, and reciprocal interest.

POOLEY, SIÂN;It has been argued that domestic service heightened divisions of class and gender, and supported the private nuclear family in late nineteenth-century England. This case study of one urban locality (Lancaster) between 1880 and 1914 uses qualitative and quantitative techniques, particularly longitudinal record linkage, to explore relationships between live-in domestic servants and their employers. It is argued that there were considerable similarities between the backgrounds and life-cycle-related motivations of both servants and employers. Relationships were highly diverse, but service simultaneously depended upon and played a crucial role in sustaining complex, localized networks that extended far beyond the servant-employing household.;2009;Domestic servants and their urban employers: a case study of Lancaster, 1880–1914;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Prados De La Escosura, Leandro; Rosés, Joan Ramón";Between 1850 and 2000 Spain's real output and labor productivity grew at average rates of 2.5 and 2.1 percent. The sources of this long-run growth are investigated here for the first time. Broad capital accumulation and efficiency gains appear as complementary in Spain's long-term growth. Factor accumulation dominated long-run growth up to 1950, while total factor productivity (TFP) led thereafter and, especially, during periods of growth acceleration. The main spurts in TFP and capital coincide with the impact of the railroads (1850s-1880), the electrification (the 1920s and 1950s), and to the adoption of new vintage technology during the Golden Age.;2009;The Sources of Long-Run Growth in Spain, 1850-2000;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

We analyze the determinants of in-hospital mortality at Touro using Oaxaca-type decomposition to aggregate our regression results.

RAY, INDRAJIT;"This article seeks to answer three basic questions about the nineteenth-century cotton textile industry in Bengal that still remain unresolved in the literature; namely, when did the industry begin to decay, what was the extent of its decay during the early nineteenth century, and what were the factors that led to this? In the absence of data on production, this article seeks to settle the debate on the basis of the industry's market performance and its consumption of raw materials. It contests the prevailing hypothesis that the industry's perpetual decline started in the late eighteenth or the early nineteenth century. Instead, it is argued that the decline started around the mid-1820s. The pace of its decline was, however, slow though steady at the beginning, but reached crisis point by 1860, when around 563,000 workers lost their jobs. Regarding the extent of its decay, this article concludes that the industry was diminished by about 28 per cent by the mid-1800s. However, it survived in the high-end and low-end domestic markets. Evidence is also gathered in favour of the hypothesis that, although British discriminatory policies undoubtedly depressed the industry's export outlet, its decay is better explained by technological innovations in Great Britain.";2009;Identifying the woes of the cotton textile industry in Bengal: tales of the nineteenth century;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Rosés, Joan Ramón;This paper examines changes in the organization of the Spanish cotton industry from 1736 to 1860 in its core region of Catalonia. As the Spanish cotton industry adopted the most modern technology available and experienced the transition to the factory system, cotton spinning and weaving mills became increasingly vertically integrated. Asset specificity, more than other factors, explains this tendency towards vertical integration. The probability of a firm being vertically integrated was higher among firms located in districts with high concentration ratios, and rose with size and the use of modern machinery. At the same time, subcontracting predominated in other phases of production and distribution, where transaction costs appear to be less important.;2009;Subcontracting and vertical integration in the Spanish cotton industry;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Rousseau, Peter L.;Financial economists have long believed that the liquidity of shares affects the level of participation in equity markets and is thus central to their deepening. This study examines the growth in industrial share liquidity that occurred in Boston over the latter half of the 19th century. From primary sources hitherto unused for scholarly investigations, namely the running annual worksheets of securities price fluctuations that underlie broker Joseph Martin’s volumes on the history of the Boston stock market, I construct broad-based indices of annual prices and returns for banking and industrial equities, as well as measures of real market capitalization. A series of vector autoregressive models then relate increases in liquidity, as measured by falling par values of industrial shares due to stock splits, write-downs and re-capitalizations, entries, and exits, to advances in prices and capitalizations among traded firms. The findings support the view that increases in participation were important for sustaining Boston as the nation’s leading industrial market until finally overtaken by New York sometime around 1900.;2009;Share liquidity, participation, and growth of the Boston market for industrial equities, 1854–1897;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Salvatore, Ricardo D.;A sustained long-term increase in average stature accompanied the process of import-substituting industrialization in the main suburban area of Argentina, the Buenos Aires Conurbano. This gain in net nutrition was attained before the rise to power of a re-distributionist political party: the Peronists. The article also provides evidence of a decline in average heights during the period 1939–1945, which challenges us to revise the traditional wisdom about the impact of World War II and Peronist social policies and its implications for the nutrition and health of children. The new evidence on heights shows also persistent social and regional differences over time that had not been documented before.;2009;Stature growth in industrializing Argentina: The Buenos Aires industrial belt 1916–1950;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Sarferaz, Samad; Uebele, Martin";We use a Bayesian dynamic factor model in order to calculate an economic activity index for Germany prior to World War I. The procedure allows us to incorporate information from a vast number of time series, which are underutilized by historical national accounts. Therefore, our indicator provides an alternative measure for economic activity, based on a broader database. To investigate industrialization, we compare our aggregate measure of economic activity with sectoral activity indices. We find that the industrial transition was completed earlier than agricultural output and employment shares suggest, since the indicator for agriculture had already decoupled from the aggregate business cycle measure during the 1860s. Moreover, we find that stock prices are strongly correlated with our indicator, and lead it by 1–2 years.;2009;Tracking down the business cycle: A dynamic factor model for Germany 1820–1913;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Chile’s export tax on nitrates later accounted for at least one half of all government revenue. We employ a multi-country model of export taxation in order to simulate the potential government revenues that Bolivia, Chile and Peru could have earned under the counterfactual scenario that Chile did not conquer the nitrate-rich provinces of its adversaries. Our results are that Peruvian and Bolivian government revenues could have been at least double their historical levels. We estimate that, over the remainder of the nineteenth century, Chile’s earnings from nitrates would have fallen by 80%.;2009;The fiscal impact of the War of the Pacific;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Siklos, Pierre L.;Canada has perhaps the longest track record of adhering to a floating exchange rate regime, but it may well also have been the first country to adopt a managed float during the 1950s. In spite of criticisms levelled at the Canadian government's decision to float the dollar, the remarkable feature of the behaviour of the exchange rate during the so-called float is the relative stability of the nominal exchange rate, and the small volatility in its movements. This article stresses the impact of foreign exchange intervention in limiting exchange rate appreciations and in moderating exchange rate volatility, using newly found, and heretofore unused, intervention data. Until now, all studies of Canada's experience with the float have relied on official foreign exchange reserves data. A counterfactual experiment also suggests that nominal exchange rate levels, and variability, would have been different had there been no foreign exchange market intervention.;2009;Not quite as advertised: Canada's managed float in the 1950s and Bank of Canada intervention;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Steckel, Richard H.;"Since 1995 approximately 325 publications on stature have appeared in the social sciences, which is more than a four-fold increase in the rate of production relative to the period 1977–1994. The expansion occurred in several areas, but especially within economics, indicating that heights are now widely accepted as useful measure of human welfare. Much of this new work extends beyond the traditional bailiwick of anthropometric history, including biological welfare during economic and political crises; anthropometric determinants of wages; the welfare of women relative to men in the contemporary world; the fetal origins hypothesis; and inequality in the developing world. The approach has also expanded within economic history to consider the consequences of empire for colonials; the health of populations lacking traditional measures of social performance; the consequences of smallpox; and very long-term trends in health. Much has also been learned about socioeconomic aspects of inequality, the welfare implications of industrialization, and socioeconomic determinants of stature.

Stewart, James I.;Historians disagree about whether geographic mobility on the frontier reflected economic hardship or opportunity because of the inability to observe the outcomes of non-persisters. This article uses a new sample of frontier families linked between the 1860, 1870, and 1880 U.S. censuses to study mobility and wealth accumulation. Using the incidence of Confederate guerilla warfare in frontier counties to generate exogenous migration, I find the effect of persistence on wealth accumulation is insignificant. Also, young, blue-collar, and landless families—those with the highest net benefits of migration—were the most likely to move. These findings reflect widespread economic opportunity on the frontier.;2009;Economic Opportunity or Hardship?

Stoddard, Christiana;Why do voters publicly fund education? I examine two explanations: public funds may be a means for decisive voters to transfer wealth to themselves or voters may subsidize the education of others to raise social education levels and realize external benefits. I test these theories in the 1800s, when full tax support of primary schools emerged. States where median and mean wealth was closer together had higher fractions of education revenue from public sources. Attendance rates rose when the public share of education funding rose, especially for poor children. These facts are consistent with a model with external benefits of education.;2009;Why did Education Become Publicly Funded?

According to conventional wisdom, the Riksbank was the first central bank to adopt price-level targeting, although in practice giving priority to exchange-rate stabilisation. Based on Bayesian econometric techniques and the evaluation of new archival sources, we come to the conclusion that defending a fixed exchange rate is hard to reconcile with the claim of adopting price-level targeting. This finding has implications for the prevailing view of the 1930s as a decade of great policy innovations.;2009;A pioneer of a new monetary policy?

SUZUKI, AKIHITO;This article explores the spatio-temporal structure of infectious diseases in modern Japan, using measles mortality data from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Three aspects of the epidemiology of measles are discussed: the synchronization of epidemic waves, seasonality, and age at infection. These epidemiological analyses are connected to, respectively, regional integration, governmental policy on primary school education, and the number of young children in families. In addition, based on the fact that measles did not become endemic in early modern Edo (Tokyo), this article corrects epidemiologists' misunderstanding about the threshold of endemicity and argues that the critical population size varied substantially according to the societal factors of a given community. In so doing, this article suggests that historians can use measles data as a new biometric index for studying human health and socio-economic conditions in societies of the past.;2009;Measles and the spatio-temporal structure of modern Japan;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

But did they abandon mixed husbandry in the process? This article explores the origins of the modern relationship between scale and diversity using a new sample of Kansas farms. In 25 townships across the state, between 1875 and 1940, the evidence demonstrates that relatively few plains farms were agents of early monoculture. Rather than a process driven by single-crop farming, settlement was shaped by farms that grew more diverse with each generation.;2009;Ecological Frontiers on the Grasslands of Kansas: Changes in Farm Scale and Crop Diversity;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Timmer, Marcel P.; Vries, Gaaitzen J. de";Recent studies of economic growth have moved from explaining average trends in long-term growth to study growth accelerations and decelerations. In this paper we argue that the standard shift-share analysis is inadequate to measure the contribution of sectors to accelerations in productivity. We present a modified shift-share method, which takes account of surplus labour in agriculture and accounts for the contribution to growth from expanding sectors. We apply this novel methodology to the GGDC 10-sector database, which is a new data set with annual time series of value added and persons employed for the ten main sectors of the economy. The data set covers 19 countries in Asia and Latin America spanning the period from 1950 to 2005. We find that growth accelerations are explained by productivity increases within sectors, not by reallocation of employment to more productive sectors. Challenging conventional wisdom, productivity improvement in market services is more important than productivity growth in manufacturing.;2009;Structural change and growth accelerations in Asia and Latin America: a new sectoral data set;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Turner, John D.;The joint-stock banks that established after the liberalizing legislation of 1826 were periodically criticized during the nineteenth century for their low-quality and rapidly deteriorating shareholder constituencies. The quality of a bank's shareholding constituency was of paramount importance because of unlimited shareholder liability. Using archival records, this article examines the quality of bank shareholder constituencies over the nineteenth century. The main finding is that shareholder constituencies did not deteriorate in quality until the introduction of limited liability. The non-deterioration of constituencies is attributed to bank deeds which locked in the aggregate quality of shareholder constituencies by empowering directors to vet all share transfers.;2009;Wider share ownership?: investors in English and Welsh Bank shares in the nineteenth century;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"van Overfelt, Wouter; Annaert, Jan; Ceuster, Marc J.K. de; Deloof, Marc";We investigate the impact of universal bank relations on the performance and the risk of listed companies in Belgium in the period 1905–1909. Our results are consistent with the view that universal banks are efficient institutions which overcome problems of asymmetric association inevitably associated with external finance. We find that universal bank affiliation was positively linked with market-to-book ratio and return-on-assets. Performance was also positively related to the degree of bank involvement. Universal bank relations were significant and negatively correlated with volatility of return-on-assets. Finally, stock return performance, measured by the Sharpe ratio, was also significantly better for affiliated corporations.;2009;Do universal banks create value?

"van POPPEL, FRANS W. A.; van DALEN, HENDRIK P.; WALHOUT, EVELIEN";The emergence of the housewife in the Netherlands over the period 1812?1922 was strongly influenced by the social norm that women should withdraw from the labour market on the eve of marriage. Adherence to this norm is most clearly reflected in the emergence of the housewife among the lower classes, especially at the close of the nineteenth century among wives of farmers. Women in urban municipalities, however, set the norm far earlier and differences across social classes were significantly greater in towns than in rural areas. Paradoxically, the rise of the housewife did not change work pressures for lower-class women.;2009;Diffusion of a social norm: tracing the emergence of the housewife in the Netherlands, 1812–1922;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
van Zanden, Jan Luiten;This article analyses the long-term development of the skill premium in western Europe in a global perspective, on the basis of data on wages of skilled and unskilled construction workers in more than a dozen European countries and regions, and in a number of non-European countries such as India, China, Japan, Russia, Korea and Indonesia. It shows that already in the late medieval period the skill premium in western Europe had fallen sharply and became, from the fifteenth century onwards, much lower than in most other parts of the world economy. Only in southern China, and perhaps also in nineteenth-century Japan, did the skill premium fall to an equally low level. The explanation for these global patterns focuses on factor proportions, the quality of institutions and demand-related factors. Moreover, it is argued that the skill premium measured in this way is also a predictor of long-term economic performance.;2009;The skill premium and the 'Great Divergence';European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Vizcarra, Catalina;Peru's experience with sovereign debt during the guano boom is one of the most remarkable in the nineteenth century. Despite the country's ongoing political instability and poor capital market reputation, the price of Peruvian bonds soared shortly after settlement in 1849, and the country enjoyed relatively low credit risk until the 1870s. This article discusses the incentives Peru and its creditors faced, and explains how Peru's extraordinary performance in financial markets was founded on its credible commitment to service its debt with the guano proceeds.;2009;Guano, Credible Commitments, and Sovereign Debt Repayment in Nineteenth-Century Peru;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Weisdorf, Jacob; Sharp, Paul";The Malthusian “preventive check” mechanism has been well documented for pre-industrial England through evidence for a negative correlation between the marriage rate and the price of wheat. Other literature, however, speculates that the correlation was in fact positive from the early nineteenth century. This paper uses the cointegrated VAR model and recursive estimation techniques to document the changing relationship between nuptiality and the price of wheat from 1541 to 1965. The relationship is indeed positive from the early nineteenth century to the First World War. A simple theoretical model shows that this result is not in fact inconsistent with a stylised Malthusian mechanism, and can be understood within the context of an increasing dominance of shocks to aggregate demand rather than to aggregate supply.;2009;From preventive to permissive checks: the changing nature of the Malthusian relationship between nuptiality and the price of provisions in the nineteenth century;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Weisdorf, Jacob L.;Time-budget studies done among contemporary primitive people suggest that the first farmers worked harder to attain subsistence than their foraging predecessors. This makes the adoption of agriculture in the Stone Age one of the major curiosities in human cultural history. Theories offered by economists and economic historians largely fail to capture work-intensification among early farmers. Attributing a key role to human metabolism, this study provides a simple framework for analysing the adoption of agriculture. It demonstrates how the additional output that farming offered could have lured people into agriculture, but that subsequent population increase would eventually have swallowed up its benefits, forcing early farmers into an irreversible trap, where they had to do more work to attain subsistence compared to their foraging ancestors. The framework draws attention to the fact that, if agriculture arose out of need, as some scholars have suggested, then this was because prehistoric foragers turned down agriculture in the first place. Estimates of population growth before and after farming, however, in the light of the present framework seem to suggest that hunters were pulled rather than pushed into agriculture.;2009;Why did the first farmers toil?

It reviews the classic literature on traditional measures of Soviet consumption and recent critiques of them. It discusses the nature of welfare and welfare indicators, the reliability of Soviet statistical indicators on welfare, and it charts the dimensions of the groups in Soviet society that were most vulnerable to these welfare crises. A range of welfare indicators covering nutrition, mortality and stature are critically examined both regarding their immediate and long-term consequences and the groups affected.;2009;The first 35 years of Soviet living standards: Secular growth and conjunctural crises in a time of famines;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
WOLF, NIKOLAUS;When did Germany become economically integrated? Based on a large new data set on trade flows within and across the borders of Germany, I explore the geography of trade costs across Central Europe, 1885–1933. The key finding is that the German Empire before 1914 was a poorly integrated economy. This internal fragmentation resulted from cultural heterogeneity, from administrative borders, and from natural geography that divided Germany into eastern and western parts. After World War I and again with the Great Depression, internal integration improved, while external integration worsened in part because of border changes along the lines of ethnolinguistic heterogeneity. By the end of the Weimar Republic in 1933, Germany was reasonably well integrated.;2009;Was Germany Ever United?

WRIGLEY, E.

He made use of the returns to produce new estimates of the population of each county from the sixteenth century onwards. His estimates were published in the 1841 census after his death and have been very widely quoted ever since.

"Abramitzky, Ran; Frank, Zephyr; Mahajan, Aprajit";We construct an individual-level data set of partnership contracts in late-nineteenth-century Rio de Janeiro to study the determinants of contract terms. Partners with limited liability contributed more capital and received lower draws for private expenses and lower profit shares than their unlimited partners. Unlimited partners in turn received higher-powered incentives when they contracted with limited partners than when they contracted with unlimited partners. A reform that changed the relative bargaining power further improved the terms of unlimited partners in limited firms.

"Andrabi, Tahir; Kuehlwein, Michael";The period 1861 to 1920 witnessed sharp price convergence in British Indian grain markets. Previous research attributed this to the construction of railways. But tests examining price differences between districts provide surprisingly weak support for that hypothesis. Railways mattered, but seem capable of explaining only about 20 percent of the decline in price dispersion. One explanation may be that India was a partially integrated economy at the time of railroad expansion. Lines connecting districts on preexisting trade routes had very small price effects. There is also some evidence of a “border effect” on lines between British India and princely states.;2010;Railways and Price Convergence in British India;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Even so, it proves to be a relatively good source for seventeenth-century London, and for calculating associated median and mean rents, as well as a Gini coefficient of inequality for the distribution of resources. Through other evidence in the Settlement, rent/income ratios for London can be approximated, and from them estimates made of London's median income. Median rents and income also allow estimates of the percentage of Londoners in poverty.

In no other part of the world was the cotton industry situated on a coalfield, and the response of other parts of the world cotton industry to Lancashire's agglomeration advantages was dispersal in search of cheap water and/or labour power.

Our findings confirm the existence of a substantial gap in living standards between China and North-western Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. They also reveal a sustained decline in living standards and human capital at least in South China from the mid-nineteenth century followed by a recovery in the early twentieth century. However, comparative examination of age-heaping data shows that the level of Chinese human capital was relatively high by world standard during this period.

BEL, GERMÀ;Nationalization was particularly important in the early 1930s in Germany. The state took over a large industrial concern, large commercial banks, and other minor firms. In the mid-1930s, the Nazi regime transferred public ownership to the private sector. In doing so, they went against the mainstream trends in western capitalistic countries, none of which systematically reprivatized firms during the 1930s. Privatization was used as a political tool to enhance support for the government and for the Nazi Party. In addition, growing financial restrictions because of the cost of the rearmament programme provided additional motivations for privatization.;2010;Against the mainstream: Nazi privatization in 1930s Germany;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Bell, Adrian R.; Sutcliffe, Charles";Medieval bishops condemned and restricted the sale of corrodies (a type of annuity), partly on the grounds of their perceived unprofitability. The available data on the profitability of corrodies is limited and little analysed, and the episcopal condemnation of corrodies has been adopted by modern researchers. After recognising the difficulties, this paper applies an annuity pricing model to study corrody pricing. Given various assumptions, contrary to the established view, it is argued that the sale of corrodies was financially profitable for institutions. Finally, some reasons are considered for the negative attitude of contemporary and historical opinion towards the sale of corrodies.;2010;Valuing medieval annuities: Were corrodies underpriced?;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Betrán, C.; Ferri, J.; Pons, Maria A.";The current era of globalisation has witnessed a rising premium paid to skilled workers resulting in increasing wage inequality in most OECD countries. This pattern differs from that observed during the past globalisation period (1880–1913), in which wage inequality decreased in most of the Old World countries. The present debate over wage inequality focuses on the implications of globalisation, technological change, the role of labour market institutions and education. Similar factors were at work in the past globalisation process. In order to disentangle the main factors that contribute to wage inequality, we calibrate a general equilibrium model for the UK economy in the past globalisation period. The results show that a trade shock and a skilled-biased technology shock increased wage inequality. However, education and emigration had a more significant impact and led to a decrease in wage inequality.;2010;Explaining UK wage inequality in the past globalisation period, 1880–1913;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Bignon, V.; Miscio, A.";The financial market was well developed in France in the years before World War I, and there were many newspapers that provided information to investors. Yet commentators at the time faulted the financial press for inaccuracy and biases, which they linked to the existence of payments made by companies for coverage in the editorial section. This article tests whether the payment scheme induced a systematic bias in the coverage of companies listed on the Paris stock exchanges by newspapers. The results show that, although firms' media coverage was affected, the performance of firms actually touted by the press was good. Thus, the media bias can also be explained by newspapers choosing the companies' exposures according to their editorial policy.;2010;Media bias in financial newspapers: evidence from early twentieth-century France;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Blonde, B.; Hanus, Jord";Economic historians are increasingly aware of the divergence between the development of real wages and GDP per capita in pre-industrial Europe, even in affluent urbanized societies with high wage levels such as the sixteenth-century Low Countries. This article offers an empirical answer to this alleged paradox by merging living standards and real wages with income distributions in a case study of sixteenth-century 's-Hertogenbosch. It provides evidence for an optimistic reading of the living standards of this era despite the modest performance of the urban economy and a strong decline in real wages. The rich sources of 's-Hertogenbosch were instrumental in reaching this conclusion, as they offer proof that the drop in wage labourers' purchasing power was paralleled by a marked decline in social position. As such, their income experience turns out to be surprisingly atypical, and does little to capture the strong resilience of the majority of the urban populace in the face of the early price revolution.;2010;Beyond building craftsmen.

The Antwerp ?retail paradox? is that of a shrinking economic horizon running parallel to material culture and retail transformations, usually connected to expanding urban economies and societies.

Bogart, Dan;The rise of state ownership was one of the most significant policy changes in the railway sector in the early 20th century. This paper estimates the cost inefficiency of railway sectors across countries using stochastic frontier models and examines whether the rise of state ownership affected inefficiency. The results show that the trends in inefficiency differed substantially across countries from the 1880s to 1912. They also show that inefficiency increased with greater nationalizations and decreased with greater state railway construction. A counterfactual analysis suggests that the rise of state ownership contributed to lower inefficiency in most countries, but the effects within countries varied depended on whether state ownership increased through nationalizations or new construction.;2010;A global perspective on railway inefficiency and the rise of state ownership, 1880–1912;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Bohlin, J.;After 1870 Swedish agriculture was transformed in the direction of more animal husbandry. Small farmers in particular specialized in animal produce. Agricultural protectionism, which was installed in response to increasing imports of overseas grain in the 1880s, primarily served the interest of large landowners specializing in bread-grain production. The impact of agrarian tariffs on the factor rewards of landowners, capitalists and workers is explored by means of a Computable General Equilibrium model of the Swedish economy in 1913. Landowners predictably benefited from agrarian tariffs, the more so if they specialized in bread-grain, as did rural workers. Urban capitalists would generally gain if agrarian tariffs had been dismantled. Real wages of workers in urban industries would most likely also improve, but the gain of urban workers was less clear-cut than for urban capitalists, being dependent on the degree of rural–urban labour mobility in response to wage changes.;2010;The income distributional consequences of agrarian tariffs in Sweden on the eve of World War I;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The results suggest a strong systematic co-movement between wheat production and ship traffic, with less evidence for wine production and stock-herding activities. While ship traffic created demand for wheat exports, the size of the co-movement provides evidence that ship traffic also stimulated local demand through secondary and tertiary sector activities, supporting the hypothesis that ship traffic acted as a catalyst for growth in the Cape economy.;2010;The significance of the Cape trade route to economic activity in the Cape Colony: a medium-term business cycle analysis;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

For the aggregate economy, the real wage gap was about the same as the labor productivity gap, but again there were important sectoral differences. Compared to their productivity, German industrial workers were poorly paid, whereas German agricultural and service sector employees were overpaid. This affected the competitiveness of the two countries in these sectors. There were also important differences in comparative real wages by skill level, affecting the extent of poverty.;2010;Real Wages and Labor Productivity in Britain and Germany, 1871–1938: A Unified Approach to the International Comparison of Living Standards;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Broadberry, Stephen N.; Gupta, Bishnupriya";India fell further behind the UK in terms of GDP per capita and overall labour productivity between the 1870s and the 1970s, but has been catching-up since. This paper offers a sectoral analysis of these trends. Comparative India/UK labour productivity in agriculture has declined continuously, and agriculture still accounts for around two-thirds of employment in India. Agriculture thus played a key role in India’s falling behind and has subsequently slowed down the process of catching up. Although there have been substantial fluctuations in comparative India/UK labour productivity in industry, this sector has exhibited no long run trend. The only sector to exhibit an upward trend in comparative India/UK labour productivity is services. India’s recent emergence as a dynamic service-led economy thus appears to have long historical roots. Although India has been characterised by relatively low levels of physical and human capital formation overall, its education provision has historically been unusually skewed towards secondary and tertiary levels. This has provided a limited supply of high productivity workers who have been employed predominantly in services.;2010;The historical roots of India’s service-led development: A sectoral analysis of Anglo-Indian productivity differences, 1870–2000;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

In order to prove this new thesis of continuity, we show on the basis of firm-level data, firstly, that investment in production capacities had already started before the war and was especially high in the early phase of the war, and secondly, that the regulatory setting of aircraft production management was rather constant and was not dramatically changed after 1941. In addition, we demonstrate that the driving forces of productivity growth were primarily learning-by-doing and outsourcing, the latter being generally neglected by economic historians.;2010;Fixed-price contracts, learning, and outsourcing: explaining the continuous growth of output and labour productivity in the German aircraft industry during the Second World War;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Chaudhary, Latika;This paper measures the effects of public expenditures on literacy in early 20th century British India. Using a new dataset and an instrumental variables strategy, I find that public investments in primary education had positive and statistically significant effects on literacy. A 10 percent increase in 1911 per-capita spending or 44 additional primary schools would have translated into a 2.6percentage point increase in 1921 literacy in the population aged 15–20. The findings, however, differ by gender: the IV estimates on spending are statistically significant only for male literacy.

CHRISTOPHER, A. J.;The population census is one of the major statistics gathering exercises undertaken by the state, when information on a wide range of personal attributes is demanded. None is more problematic than occupation, which, for clarity, requires the subsequent simplification and classification of the myriad of self-descriptions collected. Nowhere is this more evident than in South Africa before 1958. Conflict between British imperial directives and local peculiarities, notably the issue of race, resulted in the adoption of widely fluctuating classification schemes. Consequently, direct comparisons between the published occupational statistics of successive enumerations are highly problematic, if not impossible.;2010;Occupational classification in the South African census before ISCO-58;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The regional market cycles diverged, as regions specialized in different sectors of production; market-cycle convergence is observed only within the “industrial triangle,” the regions of which also developed different specializations.

Coppola, Michela;"We investigate the trend and the regional variation in height among German military recruits born during the first half of the nineteenth century. The results show a downturn in height, as in many other parts of Europe and America, particularly substantial for those born at the end of the 1830s. At a regional level, however, major differences emerge from the analysis. First of all, a major height difference between recruits from southern and northern states emerges, probably due to the lower population density and to the specialization in dairy farming in the north. Secondly, time trends reveal at least three different patterns, probably related to the different underlying economic structure: in Bavaria, where the production system was more backward and changed relatively little in the early nineteenth century, heights almost stagnated at very low levels for the whole period under study; in the southwest, characterized by a more dynamic proto-industrial structure, height declined in years of declining grain prices and slightly increased when food prices recovered; in the agricultural north, where the peasants were mainly cottagers working on big estates cultivated with intensive practices, the overall decline in height is much less marked than in the southwest, and the trend moves in a countercyclical fashion with respect to food prices. A separate analysis for Prussia reveals a further differentiation between the west and east Elbian regions: the height of eastern Prussians appears to increase during the 1820s and the early 1830s. As the present sample is mainly representative of non-agricultural workers, the positive trend in the east may be due to both an improved food supply, fostered by a stronger application of the agrarian reforms, and a lower degree of competition among industrial workers, due to a delayed dismantling of the guild systems.";2010;The biological standard of living in Germany before the Kaiserreich, 1815-1840: insights from English army data;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

My findings have implications for understanding racial differences in rates of retirement and independent living at the beginning of the twentieth century, the rise in retirement prior to 1930, and the subsequent convergence in black-white retirement rates and living arrangements.;2010;Pensions and Retirement Among Black Union Army Veterans;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"CRAYEN, DOROTHEE; Baten, Jörg";This study is the first to explore long-run trends of numeracy for the period from 1820 to 1949 in 165 countries, and its contribution to growth. Estimates of the long-run numeracy development of most countries in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, America, and Europe are presented, using age-heaping techniques. Assessing the determinants of numeracy, we find school enrollment as well as Chinese instruments of number learning to have been particularly important. We also study the contribution of numeracy as measured by the age-heaping strategy for long-run economic growth using a pooled cross-section analysis. In a variety of ways, numeracy proved to be crucial for growth patterns around the globe.;2010;Global trends in numeracy 1820–1949 and its implications for long-term growth;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

For France, we map differential numeracy between the upper and lower segments of a sample population for 26 regions during the seventeenth century. For the US, inequality of numeracy is estimated for 25 states during the 19th century. Testing the hypothesis of a negative impact of inequality on welfare growth, we find evidence that lower inequality increased industrial development in the US, whereas for France such an effect was only evident in interactions with political variables such as proximity to central government.;2010;New evidence and new methods to measure human capital inequality before and during the industrial revolution: France and the US in the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
DAUDIN, GUILLAUME;This article tests whether smaller domestic markets can explain why France industrialized more slowly than Britain. To do so, it uses the Tableauxdu Maximum. It begins by presenting this source and then checks if the data from the source are plausible using a logit theoretical gravity equation. The results of this gravity equation are then employed to compute the expected market size of specific supply centers. Even if differences in real, nominal, and disposable income are taken into account, some French supply centers had access to domestic markets that were larger than the whole of Britain.;2010;Domestic Trade and Market Size in Late-Eighteenth-Century France;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Devaney, Steven;This paper details the construction and analysis of a dataset of office lettings, which is used to produce a rent index for the City of London spanning the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It advances prior research through application of a modern version of the repeat measures technique and in coverage of years where office rents have not been previously measured. Results show that there has been no real growth in rents over the period as a whole. However, there have been distinct phases of rental growth and decline that correspond with the wider economic fortunes of the City.;2010;Trends in office rents in the City of London: 1867–1959;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Di MARTINO, PAOLO; Vasta, Michelangelo";This article analyses the functioning of Italian insolvency laws and practices, in particular their role in the selection and relaunch of viable firms. The article investigates the period between the 1920s and the 1970s, and focuses on joint-stock companies. Using comparative data on the number of cases, we show that in Italy firms mainly used the procedure called fallimento (bankruptcy), consisting of the collection and subsequent liquidation of assets. Other procedures, such as deals with creditors or forms of receivership, able to give companies a further chance, were rarely used. On the basis of archival documents we maintain that this result was due to the strictness and complication of Italian procedures, as well as to their inability to select viable companies. The article also investigates the relation between the features of insolvency law and the nature of the Italian industrial system, specifically the peculiar small size and rapid turnover of joint-stock companies. We suggest that the pro-liquidation character of the insolvency law might have been one of the causes of the peculiarity of Italian industrial capitalism, even if the opposite direction of causality cannot be excluded.;2010;Companies' insolvency and ‘the nature of the firm’ in Italy, 1920s–70s;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The ranking is based on data collected for the year 2007. Journals are ranked using standard citation analysis where we adjust for age, size and self-citation of journals. We also compare the leading economic history journals with the leading journals in economics in order to measure the influence on economics of economic history, and vice versa. With a few exceptions, our results confirm the general idea about what economic history journals are the most influential for economic history, and that, although economic history is quite independent from economics as a whole, knowledge exchange between the two fields is indeed going on.;2010;Ranking economic history journals: a citation-based impact-adjusted analysis;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

This article argues that both advocates and critics of such models, particularly in the recent controversy over ?gentlemanly capitalism?, pay insufficient attention to the City itself. Using the Edwardian City's connections with Australia and Canada, it illustrates the range of financial intermediaries involved and explores their perceptions of political economy in these countries. It concludes that the City's influence (or ?structural power?) was limited by its internal divisions and hazy conceptions of political economy.;2010;‘The rules of the game’: London finance, Australia, and Canada, c.1900–14;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Drelichman, Mauricio; Voth, Hans-Joachim";The defaults of Philip II have attained mythical status as the origin of sovereign debt crises. We reassess the fiscal position of Habsburg Castile, deriving comprehensive estimates of revenue, debt, and expenditure from new archival data. The king's debts were sustainable. Primary surpluses were large and rising. Debt-to-revenue ratios remained broadly unchanged during Philip's reign. Castilian finances in the sixteenth century compare favorably with those of other early modern fiscal states at the height of their imperial ambitions, including Britain. The defaults of Philip II therefore reflected short-term liquidity crises, and were not a sign of unsustainable debts.;2010;The Sustainable Debts of Philip II: A Reconstruction of Castile's Fiscal Position, 1566–1596;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The results show rapidly decreasing prices in the industry producing electric motors in the 1920s.

"Eichengreen, Barry; Irwin, Douglas A.";The Great Depression was marked by a severe outbreak of protectionist trade policies. But contrary to the presumption that all countries scrambled to raise trade barriers, there was substantial cross-country variation in the movement to protectionism. Specifically, countries that remained on the gold standard resorted to tariffs, import quotas, and exchange controls to a greater extent than countries that went off gold. Just as the gold standard constraint on monetary policy is critical to understanding macroeconomic developments in this period, exchange rate policies help explain changes in trade policy.;2010;The Slide to Protectionism in the Great Depression: Who Succumbed and Why?;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Ejrnaes, M.; Persson, Karl Gunnar";This article looks at the gains from improved market efficiency in long-distance grain trade in the second half of the nineteenth century, when violations of the law of one price were reduced due to improved information transmission. Two markets, a major export centre, Chicago, and a major importer, Liverpool, are analysed. We show that the law of one price equilibrium was an ‘attractor equilibrium’. The implication is that prices converged to that equilibrium in a tâtonnement process. Because of asymmetrically timed information between markets separated by long distances there were periods of excess demand as well as excess supply, which triggered off the tâtonnement process. Over time, adjustments to equilibrium, as measured by the half-life of a shock, became faster and violations of the law of one price become smaller. There were significant gains from improved market efficiency, which took place after the information ‘regime’ shifted from pre-telegraphic communication to a regime with swift transmission of information in an era that saw the development of a sophisticated commercial press and telegraphic communication. This article is the first attempt to actually measure the gains from improved market efficiency and it demonstrates that improved market efficiency probably stimulated trade more than falling transatlantic transport costs. Deadweight losses decline significantly as markets became more efficient. The conventional view that Harberger triangles are almost always insignificant is challenged.;2010;The gains from improved market efficiency: trade before and after the transatlantic telegraph;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Emery, J.C.Herbert;Between 1915 and 1920, 18 U.S. states considered the introduction of compulsory health insurance. Progressive reformers expected state health insurance to be welfare enhancing for American wage-workers since it would result in lower cost insurance and an extension of coverage to more of the population. The evidence presented in this paper indicates that the absence of broad political support for health insurance legislation in this early period reflects that compulsory insurance would not have improved on what was available and affordable through voluntary arrangements and had the potential to reduce the welfare of wage-earners.;2010;“Un-American” or unnecessary?

"Federico, Giovanni; Vasta, Michelangelo";The specialization in exporting primary products is frequently deemed harmful for long-run development, because it increases volatility of terms of trade and thus the number and frequency of macroeconomic shocks. One would expect modern economic growth to solve the problem by changing the composition of trade. This paper tests this hypothesis with a new series of Italian terms of trade from 1861 to 1939, a period which spans the first stage of the industrialization of the country. The results do not tally with the hypothesis. The change in composition improved marginally the terms of trade, but it did not help much in terms of volatility.;2010;Was industrialization an escape from the commodity lottery?

Field, Alexander J.;Between 1890 and 2004 total factor productivity (TFP) growth in the United States has been strongly procyclical, while labor productivity growth has been mildly so. This article argues that these results are not simply a statistical artifact, as Mathew Shapiro and others have argued. Procyclicality resulted principally from demand shocks interacting with capital services which are relatively invariant over the cycle. This account contrasts with explanations emphasizing labor hoarding as well as those offered by the real business cycle (RBC) program, in which TFP shocks (deviations from trend) are themselves the cause of cycles.;2010;The Procyclical Behavior of Total Factor Productivity in the United States, 1890–2004;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Fohlin, Caroline;Investors in new stock issues in Germany in the 1880s experienced low spreads between the price they paid for stock and the price at which they could sell the stock in the market. Stock issuing companies paid substantial fees to underwriting banks, and these costs increased with the underwriter's market share. Bank's faced lower issuing costs than did nonfinancial firms. These patterns are consistent with a situation in which underwriters exploited their access to better information (agency problems) and had market power, but do not support the supposed lemons problems that motivated the imposition of stringent regulations in 1896.;2010;Asymmetric Information, Market Power, and the Underpricing of New Stock Issues in Germany, 1882–1892;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Firm size and earnings/price ratio relate positively but weakly to returns. The results indicate that the Berlin market did not suffer from unusually large pricing anomalies; thus, its performance was not substantially different from modern markets.

"Fourie, Johan; Fintel, Dieter von";One reason for the relatively poor development performance of many countries around the world today may be the high levels of inequality during and after colonisation. Evidence from colonies in the Americas suggests that skewed initial factor endowments could create small elites that own a disproportionate share of wealth, human capital and political power. The Cape Colony, founded in 1652 at the southern tip of Africa, presents a case where a mercantilist company (the Dutch East India Company) settled on the land and established a unique set of institutions, within which inequality evolved. This paper provides a long-run quantitative analysis of trends in asset-based inequality (using principal components analysis on tax inventories) during the seventeenth and eighteenth century, allowing, for the first time, a dynamic rather than static analysis of inequality trends in a newly settled and pre-industrial society over this period. While theory testing in other societies has been severely limited because of a scarcity of quantitative evidence, this study presents a history with evidence, enabling an evaluation of the Engerman--Sokoloff and other hypotheses.;2010;The dynamics of inequality in a newly settled, pre-industrial society: the case of the Cape Colony;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Go, Sun; Lindert, Peter H.";Three factors help to explain why school enrollments in the Northern United States were higher than those in the South and in most of Europe by 1850. One was affordability: the northern schools had lower direct costs relative to income. The second was the greater autonomy of local governments. The third was the greater diffusion of voting power among the citizenry in much of the North, especially in rural communities. The distribution of local political voice appears to be a robust predictor of tax support and enrollments, both within and between regions. Extra local voice raised tax support without crowding out private support for education.;2010;The Uneven Rise of American Public Schools to 1850;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Grubb, Farley;"The U.S. Constitution removed real and monetary trade barriers between the states. By contrast, these states when they were British colonies exercised considerable real and monetary sovereignty over their borders. Purchasing power parity is used to measure how much economic integration between the states was gained in the decades after the Constitution's adoption compared with what existed among the same locations during the late colonial period. Using this measure, the short-run effect of the Constitution on economic integration was minimal. This may have been because the Constitution did not eliminate all the institutional barriers to interstate trade before 1812.

Hanes, Christopher;Though almost no postwar union contracts indexed wage rates to prices of the employer’s products, union agreements linking wage rates to product prices, known as sliding scales, were common in some industries in the United States and Britain from the 1860s through the 1930s. This paper explains why sliding scales disappeared after the 1930s, and examines what practical experience with sliding scales revealed about fundamental constraints on wage indexation. Paradoxically, the history of sliding scales confirms that workers’ information about product prices and materials costs is generally imperfect, in ways that would substantially constrain wage indexation in long-term contracts. Sliding scales were not indexed long-term contracts, but rather devices to forestall costly strikes in the absence of contracts by revealing employers’ private information about product demand. In the postwar US, unions and employers failed to link wage rates to product prices because they had gained the ability to enter binding contracts, which could achieve the benefits of preventing strikes without incurring the extra negotiation costs and information problems associated with product-price indexation. I present a model to show how sliding scales could forestall strikes by revealing information, and how the introduction of binding union contracts reduced incentives to link wages to product prices.;2010;The rise and fall of the sliding scale, or why wages are no longer indexed to product prices;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"HANTKE, M. A.X.; Spoerer, Mark";Weimar's politicians used to attribute the continuous budget crises after the currency stabilization of 1923?4 to the burden put on the German economy by the Treaty of Versailles, in particular the reparation payments. This argument, which is still popular, neglects the fact that the restriction of the German military to 115,000 men relieved the German central budget considerably. In a counterfactual analysis we assess the savings in additional military costs and compare them to the reparation payments. Depending on the character of the foreign policy pursued by an unrestricted Germany, we find that the net effect of the Treaty's stipulations on the German central budgets was either much lower than hitherto thought or even positive. This finding gives support to the argument that Germany suffered from home-made political failure even in the relatively stable period from 1924 to 1929.;2010;The imposed gift of Versailles: the fiscal effects of restricting the size of Germany's armed forces, 1924–9;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

We extend this inquiry by inferring votes related to currency and debt issues which Beard put forth as the prime issues for those who owned personalty. Our analysis on these votes generates little support for a narrow version of the Beard thesis, which states that all personalty groups voted in a unified coalition at the Convention and supported the Constitution.

While not dismissing the insights arising from entitlements theory, the article takes issue with recent writings that have explained the famine of 1622?3 in north-west England as an entitlements crisis. It offers new empirical evidence from an estate in east Lancashire to demonstrate the scale of the crisis in the early 1620s, using estate accounts to produce new price data and estimates of productivity. On the basis of oat tithe data, the scale of the shortfall in foodstuffs in the harvest of 1621 is demonstrated as being probably in the region of a third; that of the following year has to be inferred from price data. The evidence shows that the crisis was not limited to the arable economy, but was followed by an extensive restocking of the pastoral economy.

"Huberman, Michael; Meissner, Christopher M.";The received view pins the adoption of labor regulation before 1914 on domestic forces. Using directed dyad-year event history analysis, we find that trade was also a pathway of diffusion. Market access served as an important instrument to encourage the diffusion of labor regulation. The type of trade mattered as much as the volume. In the European core, states emulated the labor regulation of partners because intra-industry trade was important. The New World exported less differentiated products and pressures to imitate were weak.;2010;Riding the Wave of Trade: The Rise of Labor Regulation in the Golden Age of Globalization;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Trade costs fell on average by 10–16 percent between 1870 and 1913.

These states not only enjoyed greater capacity to deal with domestic and external challenges, they were also able to shield their economies better against wars. This article examines the Ottoman experience with fiscal centralization using recently compiled evidence from budgets. It shows that due to high shares of intermediaries, Ottoman revenues lagged behind those of other states in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

"Kastl, Jakub; Moore, Lyndon";The German firm of Siemens and Halske introduced many enterprising features of what later came to be known as welfare capitalism in the mid-nineteenth century. Profit sharing, annual bonuses, a pension fund, a reduction in work hours, and an annual party were all means to ensure a productive, trouble-free workforce. We investigate the reasons why Siemens and Halske introduced this internal welfare system. We focus on the by-far most expensive part of the welfare system: the pension fund introduced in 1872, more than a decade before the nationwide social security system was implemented in Germany. We find that the adoption of the internal welfare system increased labor productivity, and in addition discouraged workers from striking. We estimate that the company’s gains due to strike prevention and higher productivity were at least as high as the cost of the pension fund. This suggests that (1) the introduction of a pension fund is not inconsistent with simple profit maximizing behavior on the firm’s side and (2) increased labor unionization induced firms to introduce subjective components of workers’ remuneration packages.;2010;Wily welfare capitalist: Werner von Siemens and the pension plan;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

In addition, we explain why, under the conditions of pre-industrial agriculture, regions with the highest output growth did not necessarily have to exhibit the most dynamic TFP-growth, even if they contributed, on average, the most to output growth.;2010;Technical change in Westphalian peasant agriculture and the rise of the Ruhr, circa 1830-1880;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Ultimately, only owner and collective coworker discrimination can explain baseball's slow pace of integration.

This article seeks to argue the contrary, using a case study from Catalonia, in southern Europe, which provides a rare example of early industrialization on the periphery of Europe. Using an in-depth study of an important proto-industrial community, Igualada, the article puts forward two key arguments. First, it shows how the proto-industrialization of the woollen industry and later the cotton industry shaped the transition to the factory. There were important continuities throughout in terms of human capital and organization of production; in particular, the persistence of the family as unit of production. Second, the impact of proto-industrialization on the family economy is shown to have had important consequences for demographic behaviour. As in other areas of Europe, there was a notable impact on age at marriage and on marital fertility. Equally important, however, was the impact on mortality and migration, aspects that have been neglected by historians. In particular, the high infant and child mortality rates for Igualada suggest that historians need to rethink the effect of proto-industrialization upon life chances.";2010;Is it still helpful to talk about proto-industrialization?

However, the Second World War and the subsequent struggle for independence resulted in disintegrated and inefficient markets. It is only since the late 1970s that markets in Indonesia have returned to a situation in which we can speak about a national integrated economy with well-functioning markets.;2010;Unity or diversity?

The north's ascendancy stemmed from refinements to a well-functioning trading system rather than from the creation of wholly new channels of trade. The emergent exporters of Leeds and Manchester were driven as much by the dictates of sales as of manufacturing; their factory investments were just one component of a series of connections with production. American importers retained their role as intermediaries between English exporters and backcountry retailers.";2010;Yorkshire and Lancashire ascendant: England's textile exports to New York and Philadelphia, 1750–1805;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Metz, Rainer;A large proportion of today’s econometric literature addresses the question of whether long run GDP follows a random walk or a log linear trend with one or more structural breaks. Much less attention is paid to the modelling of the long run trend and cycle component. In most studies, the trend is simply eliminated by taking first differences of the log of the series without considering the implications of this kind of trend removal for growth and cycles. Filter design and model-based approaches are used here to assess the long run trend and the cyclical component of Chile’s per capita GDP from 1820 to 2007. Careful attention is paid to outliers and trend breaks and how they influence the appraisal of the components. We show that filter and model-based approaches give comparable results if the filter and model parameters are not chosen mechanically but tailor-made for the time series to be investigated.;2010;Filter-design and model-based analysis of trends and cycles in the presence of outliers and structural breaks;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

We first examine the political economy of Japan's adoption of the gold standard in 1897 by exploring the ex ante motives of policymakers as well as how the legislative decision to adopt gold won approval. We then show that joining the gold standard did not reduce Japanese interest rates or lead to a domestic investment boom. However, we find that membership in the gold standard increased Japan's exports by lowering transactions costs. Joining gold allowed Japan to tap into its growing share of global trade that was centered on the gold standard.;2010;Why did Countries Adopt the Gold Standard?

"Murtin, Fabrice; Viarengo, Martina";This paper derives original series of average years of schooling in the United States 1870–1930, which take into account the impact of mass migrations on the US educational level. We reconstruct the foreign-born US population by age and by country of origin, while combining data on the flow of migrants by country and the age pyramids of migrants by country. Then, we use original data on educational attainment in the nineteenth century presented in Morrisson and Murtin (J Human Cap, in press) in order to estimate the educational level of US immigrants by age and by country. As a result, our series are consistent with the first national estimates of average schooling in 1940. We show that mass migrations have had a significant but modest impact on the US average educational attainment. However, the educational gap between US natives and immigrants was large and increased with the second immigration wave, a phenomenon that most likely fostered the implementation of restrictive immigration rules in the 1920s.;2010;American education in the age of mass migrations 1870–1930;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
NASH, R. C.;Europe's indigo imports grew rapidly from the 1720s, but the mid-century wars (1739?48, 1756?63) had a devastating effect on the European textile industries and hence on the indigo trade. Britain's indigo market, however, boomed in wartime on the bases of prize indigo captured from France and Spain and of indigo imported from South Carolina. The rise of South Carolina's trade from the mid-1740s was not caused, as the historiography claims, by its monopoly of the British market?such a monopoly never existed?but because the depression in South Carolina's major staple, rice, compelled a remodelling of the South Carolina plantation system, which produced an elastic supply of indigo. Carolina indigo was blighted by a poor reputation, not, as is usually argued, because British merchants maligned unfairly its quality, but because Carolina planters failed to achieve consistent production standards. Carolina indigo nevertheless succeeded in displacing French and Spanish indigo in the British and in some continental markets, reflecting the demand for cheap dyestuffs from manufacturers of low-cost textiles, the fastest-growing sectors of the European textile industries at the onset of industrialization.;2010;South Carolina indigo, European textiles, and the British Atlantic economy in the eighteenth century;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Positive shocks to relief during the First New Deal were followed by increased private employment and earnings, consistent with demand stimulus in that period. On the other hand, increases in work relief spending during the Second New Deal were followed by decreased employment and increased earnings, consistent with crowding out. The timing of spending is consistent with claims that the Roosevelt administration used relief spending to sway elections.;2010;The Dynamics of Relief Spending and the Private Urban Labor Market During the New Deal;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Nicholas, Tom;"Why did independent inventors account for over half of U.S. patents by 1930 and more than three times the number granted to R&D firms? Using new data on patents and historical patent citations, I show that independents supplied high-quality innovations to a geographically broad market for ideas. Those close to large urban centers developed some of the most significant technological advances. Demand for independent inventions remained high during the growth of the corporate economy as firms continued to acquire external innovations that complemented formal R&D. Despite their relative decline, independents remained central to the process of technological development.

In particular, we combine a data set of 116 inventories from Palencia (in northern Spain) between 1750 and 1770 with census information (Catastro de Ensenada) in order to create a cross-section estimate of money demand, a first for any period before the nineteenth century.

Were they shaped by the “social capital” of traditional institutions? How were they affected by social constraints on women? It finds that people in central Europe did desire to increase market work and consumption. But elites used the social capital of traditional institutions to oppose new work and consumption practices, especially by women, migrants, and the poor.

Previously, historians had to rely on either goods or income summary assessments in the enrolled subsidy returns to estimate wealth. These newly discovered valuations for 1535 provide quantitative evidence for the enormous importance of credit in trade, and show that merchants, as soon as they could, invested much of their wealth in property.;2010;The allocation of merchant capital in early Tudor London;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Olsson, Mats; Svensson, Patrick";The dating of, and explanation for, the agricultural revolution in Europe remains an elusive research task. When and why did a low-productive pre-industrial agricultural sector turn into a fast-growing, more productive one? Unique data from Sweden, consisting of more than 80,000 observations of farm production output for the period 1700–1860, are used to calculate and explain decisive changes in pre-industrial agricultural production. Our estimations show that crop production more than quadrupled during the period studied, and from the 1780s and onwards production growth by far outstripped population growth. Furthermore, the data allow us to estimate the determinants of change at individual farm level. The results show that enclosures, markets and property rights were of significant importance. Institutional changes, affecting the incentives and the organization of production, made peasants invest in production and productivity. In a general sense this shows the flexibility and awareness of pre-industrial European peasants in exploiting markets and initiating institutional change.;2010;Agricultural growth and institutions: Sweden, 1700-1860;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Pinilla, Vicente; Ayuda, María Isabel";This article examines how globalization and industrialization offered the nations of the European periphery opportunities to develop exports in sectors where they enjoyed a comparative advantage. As a case in point, we consider Spanish exports of Mediterranean horticultural products (MHP). Two bi-equational export supply and demand models (an equilibrium and a disequilibrium model) are proposed, in which volumes and prices are determined simultaneously, to throw light on the main causes of Spain's expanding exports of MHP. The results clearly reflect the primacy of rightward shifts in the supply and demand curves in explaining the growth of MHP trade by volume. Thus, both rising incomes in the more developed countries and technological change in agriculture specializing in these products were key to the growth of this trade. Meanwhile, Spanish exporters also benefited from the increasing integration of international markets, especially through declining transport costs and, to a lesser extent, trade liberalization.;2010;Taking advantage of globalization?

Notwithstanding a volatile film production environment, in terms of rate of return and market share variability, the industry has remained relatively stable and profitable. Film production by the film studios is interpreted as analogous to the construction of an investment portfolio, whereby producers diversified risk across budgetary categories. In the 1930s, high-budget film production was relatively unprofitable, but the industry adjusted to the steep decline in film-going in the postwar period by refining high-budget production as the focus for profitability.;2010;Profitability trends in Hollywood, 1929 to 1999: somebody must know something;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Our models examine the role of education expenditure, health care personnel, local wages, asset distribution, and a dummy variable for Paris as determinants of stunting, decomposing changes over time into the effects of levels and returns to the various explanatory variables used in the model of heights. All covariates are strongly significant, with education spending being particularly important.

Prado, Svante;The idea of manifest real-wage convergence for unskilled workers in the latter half of the nineteenth century stems from an article from 1995 by Jeffrey G. Williamson. That article presented real wage comparisons of unskilled urban workers for seventeen countries. Sweden, along with the rest of Scandinavia, is found to be an influential case in accounting for much of the alleged factor price convergence taking place. This paper takes a closer look at all the three steps that have to be taken in order to establish real wage comparisons, focusing on Sweden in relation to the US and the UK. The most important findings are twofold. First, that the US–Sweden wage gap is considerably smaller for manufacturing than for building workers, and second, that the rate at which Sweden’s real wages approached the American and the British has been grossly overestimated. Swedish real wages did grow rapidly, but not as rapidly as Williamson’s comparison will have us to believe, because his real wage series does not constitute a representative account of the Swedish unskilled real wage experience. It is argued that, as we suffer from a serious paucity of data for narrow and comparable samples of late nineteenth century unskilled workers, resorting to more encompassing wage measures is a more viable option. That also implies a questioning of the American unskilled wage series, which makes considerably slower progress than the wage series for manufacturing workers.;2010;Fallacious convergence?

RAHMAN, AHMED S.;How have large naval powers affected international commerce in history? Using a panel gravity model, we investigate the interactions of wars, alliances, naval power and trade from the 18th to mid-20th centuries. Striking an alliance with a naval power helps a country’s interstate commerce. Fighting a naval power on the other hand limits a country’s interstate commerce. Further, we split this effect on trade between an extensive effect (effect on a country’s trade when fighting a naval power) and an intensive effect (effect of that power gaining more naval strength). We conclude that the intensive effect is a powerful one – large navies have historically been destroyers of trade when mobilized to combat.;2010;Fighting the forces of gravity – Seapower and maritime trade between the 18th and 20th centuries;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
RIGBY, STEPHEN H.;Was there a growth in the proportion of the population living in England's towns in the later middle ages? Uncertainty about national population trends and about the taxation multipliers needed to arrive at population totals has made it difficult to answer this question. A direct comparison of the proportion of taxpayers that was urban in 1377 and 1524 suggests that the urban share of population was static or may even have declined in this period. However, such decline provides no simple index of urban prosperity or decay: a decline in urbanization could be the product of rural buoyancy rather than of urban recession.;2010;Urban population in late medieval England: the evidence of the lay subsidies;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The initial expansion of industrialization, in a context of growing economic integration of regions, promoted the spatial concentration of manufacturing in certain regions, which also benefited from the greatest advances in terms of labor productivity. Since 1900, the diffusion of manufacturing production to a greater number of locations has generated the emulation of production structures and a process of catching-up in labor productivity and wages.;2010;The upswing of regional income inequality in Spain (1860–1930);Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Selgin, G.;Thomas Sargent and François Velde (2002) argue that it took government authorities centuries to solve the ‘big problem of small change’ because those authorities were constrained, first by the lack of a sound theory of small change, and then by the lack of adequate technology for implementing the theory. British experience suggests, however, that institutions also played a crucial part. In particular, the monopolistic nature of Great Britain's official coinage arrangements undermined incentives for establishing a sound system of small change even after theoretical and technological constraints were no longer present. The institutional perspective offered here helps to explain a number of historical facts that are otherwise puzzling, including the fact that a relatively successful private-sector small-change system anticipated Great Britain's official solution to the small-change problem by two decades.;2010;The institutional roots of Great Britain's 'big problem of small change';European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Seltzer, Andrew J.;This paper examines wage adjustment in the late 19th and early 20th centuries using personnel records from the Union Bank of Australia and Williams Deacon’s Bank (England). During the period of this study there was steep and prolonged deflation. Firm-specific and industry-specific demand shocks also put downwards pressure on wages. Although it was common for individual wages at the banks to remain unchanged from year to year, wage cuts were very rare even for senior workers. Turnover at both banks was extremely low and, thus, despite flexibility in the wages of incoming workers, did not offset the effects of individual-level wage rigidity. Consequently real wages moved counter-cyclically.;2010;Did firms cut nominal wages in a deflationary environment?: Micro-level evidence from the late 19th and early 20th century banking industry;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

We conduct econometric tests for structural breaks in the time series of the government bonds for Chile and Peru between 1876 and 1890 in order to examine the effects of the changes in resource endowments on the investors’ perceptions of the risk premia of Chilean and Peruvian securities. Our results reveal that investors were extremely pessimistic about the prospects of Chilean, and especially Peruvian debt prior to the war. Early Chilean victories that anticipated the transfer of the richly endowed provinces to Chile caused significant increases in the price of Chilean securities. But such was the low regard with which investors viewed the Peruvian government that the fall of Lima caused an increase in the price of Peruvian bonds on the hope that Chile would assume some of the responsibility for them.

Smythe, Donald J.;This paper offers a Schumpeterian view of the Great Merger Movement in the American manufacturing industries, which occurred from 1895 to 1904. From this perspective, the Great Merger Movement was a response to competitive pressures associated with a number of significant technological innovations which occurred at the end of the nineteenth century. Because the implementation of these innovations required large capital investments, and because the returns to the investments would have been highly uncertain if they had been made competitively, firms at the turn of the twentieth century sought to restrain competition. Since the uncertainty precluded cooperating at arms-length, cooperation was internalized through horizontal consolidations. The consolidations in turn increased the size of the capital investments undertaken to implement the technological innovations. The theory is supported with historical evidence about the technological environment and industrial conditions at the turn of the twentieth century, and an econometric model is tested using data from the Twelfth and Thirteenth Censuses of Manufactures.;2010;A Schumpeterian view of the Great Merger Movement in American manufacturing;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Snowden, Kenneth A.;Covered mortgage bonds have been used successfully in Europe for two centuries, but failed in the United States when introduced as farm mortgage debentures in the 1880s. Using firm-level data and a sample of loans made by one Kansas mortgage company, I find that debenture programs grew out of established loan brokerage operations and were used to fund mortgages that were difficult to broker because of size, term, or risk characteristics. Debentures broadened access to the interregional mortgage market and facilitated an expansion of western farm mortgage debt before the innovation failed in the mortgage crisis of the 1890s.“[T]he availability of affordable mortgage financing is essential to turning the corner on the current housing crisis ….

"Stoian, Adrian; Fishback, Price V.";We analyze the impact of the original means-tested old-age assistance (OAA) programs on the health of the elderly prior to the first Social Security pension payments. Before 1935 a number of states had enacted their own OAA laws. After 1935 the federal government began offering matching grants and thus stimulated the adoption of OAA programs by the states. A new panel data set of 75 cities for each year between 1929 and 1938 combines mortality rates for older age groups with three measures of the OAA programs, spending on non-age-specific relief and a rich set of correlates. The data are analyzed using difference-in-difference-in-difference and instrumental variables methods. Our results suggest that old-age assistance in the 1930s had little impact on the death rate of the elderly. Our sense is that the OAA programs in the 1930s transferred the elderly from general relief programs without necessarily increasing the resources available to them.;2010;Welfare spending and mortality rates for the elderly before the Social Security era;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

This article highlights the importance of the structure of protection in the relation between trade policy and its potential growth-promoting impact. Evidence is based on a new database on industrial tariffs for the 1870s. The results show that income, factor endowment and policy independence are important for explaining regional asymmetries between tariffs and growth. At a global level, increased protection, measured by total and average tariffs on manufactures, implied more unskilled inefficient protection and less growth, and this is especially true for the poor countries in the late nineteenth century.

At first sight, the evidence on equal piece rates for spinning men and women seems to rule out wage discrimination. Nevertheless, more deeply rooted gender discrimination resulting from the segmented seventeenth-century labour market restricted women's access to many professions.

This culture, which was post-medieval yet pre-modern, derived its fundamental characteristics from the fact that it connected participants who dealt with one another as formal equals before the law. It employed strategies inside and outside the market, and, rather than embracing or rejecting commercial activity, aimed to use whatever means necessary to achieve for householders the goal of comfortable independence.;2010;Errors expected: the culture of credit in rural New England, 1750–1800;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Vries, Jan de;This article reviews the ways in which historians and economists have applied the term ?globalization? to the early modern era. It distinguishes a soft and a hard definition, and goes on to test the claims made about the driving forces shaping the growth and character of long-distance trade between Europe and Asia in the age of the European trading companies. On the basis of new estimates of the volume and value of European trade with Asia, the article concludes by identifying the factors limiting the growth of trade in this period.;2010;The limits of globalization in the early modern world;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Yuan, Tangjun; Fukao, Kyoji; Wu, Harry X.";Following the standard industry-of-origin methodology to measure production-side purchasing power parities (PPPs), this study for the first time provides a set of unit value ratios (UVRs) of manufacturing products between China, Japan, Korea and the US, based on which it derives PPP estimates for individual manufacturing industries for these East Asian countries with the US as the benchmark for ca. 1935. The estimated PPP for total manufacturing suggests that the relative level of the producer price in China, Japan and Korea was about half to two thirds of the prevailing market exchange rates, respectively. The estimated PPPs are used to calculate comparative output and labor productivity for individual industries of these countries for ca. 1935. It shows that the size of factory manufacturing in Japan was 12 percent of the US level and in China only about one percent of the US level. In terms of comparative labor productivity, measured as PPP$ per hour worked, Japanese and Korean manufacturing was 24 and 23 percent of the US level, whereas Chinese manufacturing was only 7 percent of the US level.;2010;Comparative output and labor productivity in manufacturing between China, Japan, Korea and the United States for ca. 1935 – A production-side PPP approach;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
ZAHEDIEH, NUALA;The rapid rise of England's colonial commerce in the late seventeenth century expanded the nation's resource base, stimulated efficiency improvements across the economy, and was important for long-term growth. However, close examination of the interests at play in England's Atlantic world does not support the Whiggish view that the Glorious Revolution played a benign role in this story. In the decades after the Restoration, the cases of the Royal African Company and the Spanish slave trade in Jamaica are used to show that the competition between Crown and Parliament for control of regulation constrained interest groups on either side in their efforts to capture the profits of empire. Stuart ?tyranny? was not able to damage growth and relatively competitive (and peaceful) conditions underpinned very rapid increases in colonial output and trade. The resolution of the rules of the Atlantic game in 1689 allowed a consolidated state better to manipulate and manage the imperial economy in its own interests. More secure rent-seeking enterprises and expensive wars damaged growth and European rivals began a process of catch-up. The Glorious Revolution was not sufficient to permanently halt economic development but it was sufficient to slow progress towards industrial revolution.;2010;Regulation, rent-seeking, and the Glorious Revolution in the English Atlantic economy;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Zuijderduijn, Jaco;Historians often use the concept of financial revolutions to explain the rise of the Dutch Republic, claiming that innovations in government funding allowed for marked progress in the field of public finance. The article focuses on the medieval precursors of the financial revolution, which the States of Holland brought about when they introduced province-wide public debt in the sixteenth century. The relevant techniques were already known, but predominantly used for political rather than financial purposes. Therefore techniques such as collective responsibility for debt were scarcely implemented. The article hypothesizes that sovereigns made use of the corporate personality of public bodies to increase ties with the main towns of Holland, and thus they used collective responsibility for debt to create stability. This only became a major financial instrument at the turn of the sixteenth century, when a financial crisis forced both sovereign and main towns to reorganize the medieval system of debt servicing. This centralization was crucial for the large public debt the county of Holland created under the Dutch Republic and may even be regarded as a step in the direction of national debt.;2010;The emergence of provincial debt in the county of Holland (thirteenth-sixteenth centuries);European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"ACCOMINOTTI, OLIVIER; Flandreau, Marc; Rezzik, Riad";Modern cliometric studies use dummy variables to measure the effects of institutions. The dummy variable approach can be misleading, as illustrated by recent research on the impact of colonial rule on borrowing terms. We show how trying to measure a ?colonial effect? without an analysis of the financial consequences of political subjection can be misleading. The main effect of the British Empire was to remove the default risk. Establishing how this was done, and with what effects, should take us closer to a proper understanding of the effect of empire.;2011;The spread of empire: Clio and the measurement of colonial borrowing costs;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"ACHESON, GRAEME G.; Turner, John D.";This article uses the records of nineteenth-century Scottish banks in an attempt to understand investor behaviour in the early British capital market. It presents four main findings, some of which do not conform to the basic assumptions of standard asset pricing theories. First, in an era when efficient portfolio diversification was not possible, the intrinsic risk of an equity security was an important input into investor decision-making. Second, our evidence suggests that businesspeople initially regarded bank stock as a consumption good, as being a stockholder gave them privileged access to bank finance. When bank lending practices changed in the middle of the century, this access-to-credit advantage associated with owning bank stock largely disappeared. Third, investors typically exhibited a bias towards banks that conducted business in the areas where they resided. Fourth, a sizeable proportion of investors were stockholders in more than one bank.;2011;Investor behaviour in a nascent capital market: Scottish bank shareholders in the nineteenth century;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Allen, Robert C.;Britain had a unique wage and price structure in the eighteenth century, and that structure is a key to explaining the inventions of the industrial revolution. British wages were very high by international standards, and energy was very cheap. This configuration led British firms to invent technologies that substituted capital and energy for labour. High wages also increased the supply of technology by enabling British people to acquire education and training. Britain's wage and price structure was the result of the country's success in international trade, and that owed much to mercantilism and imperialism. When technology was first invented, it was only profitable to use it in Britain, but eventually it was improved enough that it became cost-effective abroad. When the ?tipping point? occurred, foreign countries adopted the technology in its most advanced form.;2011;Why the industrial revolution was British: commerce, induced invention, and the scientific revolution;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

In the eighteenth century, the real income of building workers in Asia was similar to that of workers in the backward parts of Europe but far behind that in the leading economies in north-western Europe. Real wages stagnated in China in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries and rose slowly in the late nineteenth and early twentieth, with little cumulative change for 200 years. The income disparities of the early twentieth century were due to long-run stagnation in China combined with industrialization in Japan and Europe.;2011;Wages, prices, and living standards in China, 1738–1925: in comparison with Europe, Japan, and India;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Allen, Robert C.; Weisdorf, Jacob L.";"It is conventionally assumed that the pre-modern working year was fixed and that consumption varied with changes in wages and prices. This is challenged by the twin theories of the ?industrious? revolution and the consumer revolution, positing a longer working year as people earned surplus money to buy novel goods. In this study, we turn the conventional view on its head, fixing consumption rather than labour input. Specifically, we use a basket of basic consumption goods and compute the working year of rural and urban day labourers required to achieve that. By comparing with independent estimates of the actual working year, we find two ?industrious? revolutions among rural workers; both, however, are attributable to economic hardship, and we detect no signs of a consumer revolution. For urban labourers, by contrast, a growing gap between their actual working year and the work required to buy the basket provides great scope for a consumer revolution.";2011;Was there an ‘industrious revolution’ before the industrial revolution?

ALLEN, MARTIN;The contribution of English and Welsh lead mines to the silver supplies of mints between Domesday Book and the end of the fifteenth century is assessed in this article, comparing evidence for the size of silver production with mint output data. It is shown that the proposal that northern Pennine mines were the principal source of the silver in the late twelfth-century English currency is untenable. Welsh mines supplied limited amounts of silver to local mints around 1200. Devon silver made a significant but not predominant contribution to mint output at times of bullion scarcity in the 1290s and the mid-fifteenth century. Imported silver was usually a greater source of the metal in the English currency than locally mined silver, and gold coins constituted most of England's money supply from the mid-fourteenth century onwards.;2011;Silver production and the money supply in England and Wales, 1086–c.1500;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Álvarez, Jorge; Bilancini, Ennio; D'Alessandro, Simone; Porcile, Gabriel";In this paper we apply a model of early industrialization to the case of New Zealand and Uruguay in 1870–1940. We show how differences in agricultural institutions may have produced different development paths in two countries which were similar under many respects. While in New Zealand the active role of the Crown in regulating the land market facilitated access to land, in Uruguay land was seized by a small group of large landowners. Our model shows that land concentration may have negatively influenced industrialization and growth by impeding the formation of a large group of middle-income landowners and, as a consequence, the development of a domestic demand for basic manufactures. We support this view with a comparative analysis of agricultural institutions and industrial development in New Zealand and Uruguay.;2011;Agricultural institutions, industrialization and growth: The case of New Zealand and Uruguay in 1870–1940;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Arnold, A. J.; McCARTNEY, S.";Dividends can provide a tangible signal of earnings, but this function depends upon characteristics of financial reporting that were not always present in early financial capitalism. Although eighteenth-century English canal companies offered low-risk securitized capital approved by Parliament and were important to the development of financial capitalism, little is known about the economic state of the canal industry, beyond observed dividend levels. This article estimates rates of return on equity for a set of major English canals, but shows that their financial reporting under-represented equity inputs so that dividend rates did not reliably signal operating returns or equity-based rates of return.;2011;‘Veritable gold mines before the arrival of railway competition’: but did dividends signal rates of return in the English canal industry?;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

BATEMAN, VICTORIA N.;Using a compilation of monthly and annual wheat price data, this article examines the trend of market development in Europe from the late medieval period to the industrial revolution. In contrast to much of the earlier scholarship, which suggests that markets improved, the findings propose that markets were on average as well integrated in Europe in the early sixteenth century as in the late eighteenth century. In the intervening period, markets are found to have suffered a severe contraction. These findings enable us to build a more complete picture of markets in history, and to carry out a better examination of the relationship between markets and economic growth.;2011;The evolution of markets in early modern Europe, 1350–1800: a study of wheat prices;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Bengtsson, Tommy; Dribe, Martin";This paper deals with socioeconomic differences in adult mortality in southern Sweden 1815–1968, a period of transformation from an agricultural to a modern industrial society and increasing life expectancy. We use longitudinal micro-level data with information on demographic events, household structure and socioeconomic status. The main finding is that the socioeconomic gradient is a very recent phenomenon. While mortality fell in all socioeconomic groups it was not until the 1950s that a socioeconomic gradient appeared, and then only among adults in working ages. For the elderly, we find no significant mortality differentials between various social groups at any time. These results are consistent with the divergence hypothesis, although this process started much later than previously thought, and was not an immediate consequence of industrialization.;2011;The late emergence of socioeconomic mortality differentials: A micro-level study of adult mortality in southern Sweden 1815–1968;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Bengtsson, Tommy; van POPPEL, FRANS W. A.";In the early postwar period, improvements in life expectancy in many Western countries made health authorities, health scientists and politicians believe that social differences in mortality converged. The assumption was that inequality, when measured as death rates, was on steady decline, possibly even on the brink of disappearing. The question is then, how far back in time can social differences in mortality be traced? Can they be traced back to the agricultural society or are they a result of industrialization? Whether or not these differences are the result of the industrial revolution became a lively debated issue at the time and has continued to be discussed to date. While many scholars have taken a Malthusian view, that mortality in the past was largely determined by economic factors, others argue that mortality was determined by non-economic factors, leaving little room for a social gradient in mortality. Due to lack of coherent data covering long time periods, our knowledge has been based on bits and pieces of evidence from various locations and time periods. The evidence used is not only fragmentary but furthermore only partly comparable as different definitions of social class and mortality have been used. Here we present results from seven new studies of locations in Western and Southern Europe, the US and Canada for which individual-level longitudinal data exists during the industrialization period. Most of these studies cover also the first part of the twentieth century, a period for which such microdata hitherto has largely been lacking. Taken together, they have a wide geographic coverage and a very long time horizon. Based on these studies, we argue that social differences appeared both long before and long after the industrial breakthrough, in both cases implying that these differences are not directly related to industrialization. We also argue that the association between income and mortality observed today most likely is a recent phenomenon. Overall, a causal link between income and mortality is put into question.;2011;Socioeconomic inequalities in death from past to present: An introduction;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Betran, Concha;This paper studies the long-run pattern of regional specialisation in Spain for the period 1856–2002. We have obtained an inverted U-shape trend in manufacturing specialisation which is similar to that in the USA. Using a model that nests factor endowments and increasing returns, we find that both the latter influence manufacturing location, albeit with variations over time, factor endowments being the most decisive. Manufacturing industries intensive in agricultural and mining inputs are located near regions with these factor endowments, while human capital location gained importance from 1965 onwards. Being located near the market was also significant for some industries. The inverted U-shape observed in manufacturing specialisation is due to the fact that the importance of immobile factors increased regional specialisation. However, when mobile factors increased, as was the case with skilled labour, and when this factor converged across regions, specialisation decreased. The fact that the importance of central markets diminishing also contributed to this trend.;2011;Regional specialisation and industry location in the long run: Spain in the US mirror (1856–2002);Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Betrán, Concha; Pons, Maria A.";This paper analyses the impact of globalisation (trade and migration) on the Spanish labour market between 1880 and 1913 by examining the influence that globalisation factors had on agricultural and industrial wages. Our results show that the nineteenth century grain invasion had a negative impact on agricultural wages, whereas the fall in wheat prices did not benefit industry workers. We also found that migration pushed up real agricultural and industrial wages. As agriculture was the main sector in the economy, the final impact was a wage decrease. The negative impact of trade on agricultural and industrial labour markets partly explains the trade policy response of “integral protection”. However, other alternatives that would have been effective in raising living standards, such as migration policy, were not used.;2011;Labour market response to globalisation: Spain, 1880–1913;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

We provide a theoretical study of the market setup that emerged to deal with such problems, and we test our predictions using new evidence from contemporary sources.“A newspaper that wishes to make its fortune should never waste its columns and weary its readers by praising anything.

Birchenall, Javier A.;This paper examines the medical histories of a sample of 25,000 Union Army soldiers and veterans to study the determinants of diagnosis, discharge, and mortality from tuberculosis. We find that water and airborne diseases during the war contributed significantly to the presence of tuberculosis. Height and a higher body mass index (BMI) are also associated with protection against TB but these effects are not always robust. As an upper bound, we estimate that the contribution of modern gains in height and in BMI to the mortality decline of tuberculosis ranges from one-fourth to one-half with the rest explained by the decline in the prevalence of water and airborne diseases, especially diarrhea, dysentery, and typhoid played. The paper finds weaker support for alternative hypotheses that rely on occupational influences and exogenous changes in the virulence of tuberculosis.;2011;Airborne diseases: Tuberculosis in the Union Army;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Blum, Matthias;The First World War hit Germany severely, particularly the agricultural sector, because the outbreak came unexpected and its duration exceeded all expectations. Many resources necessary for agricultural production were required by the war economy and led to shortages and shrinking supplies. Many agricultural laborers were drafted and the blockade imposed by the allies prevented Germany from a great deal of imports. As a consequence, the nutritional situation was devastating, particularly after 1916, and hit all groups of the German society. The period under observation provides one of most drastic natural experiments in the 20th century. This study uses anthropometric data from German soldiers who served in the Second World War to trace living standards between the 1900s and the 1920s. In contrast to other approaches, this paper is able to distinguish between social groups by occupation, religious denominatio\n, regional origin, and city size. The results suggest that although all social strata were hit by famine conditions, the height of farmers, urban citizens, Catholics, and especially individuals born in the highly integrated food-import regions along the coast and the banks of the Rhine declined most.;2011;Government decisions before and during the First World War and the living standards in Germany during a drastic natural experiment;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Boberg-Fazlic, N.; Sharp, Paul Richard; Weisdorf, Jacob L.";We use data collected by the Cambridge Group to investigate and explain differences in fertility by socio-economic group in pre-industrial England. We find, in line with results presented by Greg Clark, that wealthier groups did indeed have higher fertility until the 1700s. We demonstrate that this had to do with earlier age at marriage for women. We then turn to the likely social and economic impact of this, considering Clark's hypothesis that ‘middle-class values’ spread through English society prior to the Industrial Revolution. Through the construction of social mobility tables, we demonstrate that the children of the rich were indeed spreading through society, but they were small in number relative to poorer sections of society, and moreover the children of the poor were also entering the middle classes.;2011;Survival of the richest?

Bodenhorn, Howard;Using previously unexploited data, this paper explores the ages at which slaves were manumitted. OLS estimates reveal that mixed-race slaves, slaves in the tobacco-producing Piedmont, and female slaves of female slave owners were manumitted at younger ages. Weibull proportional hazards estimates imply that the same groups were more likely to be manumitted. The results also reveal a markedly diminishing likelihood of manumission after Nat Turner’s 1831 insurrection in south-central Virginia. The results are consistent with a principal–agent model in which slave owners contracted with slaves over consumption and future manumission to elicit effort and control shirking or other unproductive activities.;2011;Manumission in nineteenth-century Virginia;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Boerner, Lars; Volckart, Oliver";This paper employs a new method and dataset to estimate the effect of currency unions on the integration of financial markets in late Medieval Central Europe. The analysis reveals that membership in a union was significantly correlated with well-integrated markets. We also examine whether currency unions were endogenous. Our results indicate that where unions were established, markets had been significantly better integrated already in the preceding period. In addition, we show that currency unions created by autonomous merchant towns were better integrated than unions implemented by territorial rulers. The overall implication is that monetary diversity was a corollary of weakly integrated markets in late Medieval Central Europe.;2011;The utility of a common coinage: Currency unions and the integration of money markets in late Medieval Central Europe;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Bogart, Dan;The Glorious Revolution has been linked with Britain's economic development in the eighteenth century. This article argues that it contributed to the early transport revolution. First, it shows that the regulatory environment became more favourable for undertakers, with their rights being better protected. Second, it shows that investment in improving roads and rivers increased substantially in the mid-1690s shortly after the Glorious Revolution. Regression analysis and structural breaks tests confirm that there was a change in investment even after controlling for other determinants of investment. The results have implications for debates on the role of political change in British economic growth.;2011;Did the Glorious Revolution contribute to the transport revolution?

"Bordo, Michael D.; Meissner, Christopher M.";We explore the association between income and international capital flows between 1880 and 1913. Capital inflows are associated with higher incomes per capita in the long run, but capital flows also brought incomes down in the short run via financial crises. Countries just barely made up for these losses over time, so that there is no conditional long-run income loss or gain for countries that experienced crises. This is in contrast to the recent wave of globalization when capital importing countries that experienced a crisis seemed to grow relatively faster over fixed periods of time. Some countries avoided crises and were able to raise incomes with foreign capital. We discuss some possibilities why.;2011;Foreign capital, financial crises and incomes in the first era of globalization;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"CLARIDGE, JORDAN; LANGDON, JOHN";As a contribution to the long-running debate concerning the extent and motivation of medieval storage, this article uses purveyance accounts to examine such facilities in England prior to the Black Death. Three hundred and fifteen cases of predominantly urban storage were recorded for 97 communities for the products of agriculture purchased by the purveyors, mostly threshed grains. When these 315 cases were analysed using an Excel database, it was found that, in contrast to the often magnificent barns on monastic and other lordly estates, this storage was much smaller and informal, often indistinguishable, it seems, from the domestic storage for families themselves. As modest as it was, however, it likely played an important role in the increasing commercialization of medieval England, even perhaps to the extent of making society at the time more susceptible to subsistence crises.;2011;Storage in medieval England: the evidence from purveyance accounts, 1295–1349;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Combes, Pierre-Philippe; Lafourcade, Miren; Thisse, Jacques-François; Toutain, Jean-Claude";This paper studies the evolution and determinants of spatial inequalities in France. To this end, we use a unique database providing data on value-added, employment, and population over the entire set of French “Départements” in 1860, 1896, 1930, 1982, and 2000. These data cover three sectors: Agriculture, Manufacturing, and Services. Firstly, we confirm the existence of a bell-shaped process of spatial concentration in Manufacturing and Services over time. In contrast, labor productivity has been converging across departments. Secondly, we find considerable agglomeration economies over the whole period. The spatial distribution of these gains is determined mainly by market potential in the first sub-period, 1860–1930, and higher education in the second, 1930–2000.;2011;The rise and fall of spatial inequalities in France: A long-run perspective;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Cook, Lisa D.;Much recent work has focused on the influence of social capital on innovative outcomes. Little research has been done on disadvantaged groups who were often restricted from participation in social networks that provide information necessary for invention and innovation. Unique new data on African American inventors and patentees between 1843 and 1930 permit an empirical investigation of the relation between social capital and economic outcomes. I find that African Americans used both traditional, i.e., occupation-based, and nontraditional, i.e., civic, networks to maximize inventive output and that laws constraining social-capital formation are most negatively correlated with economically important inventive activity.;2011;Inventing social capital: Evidence from African American inventors, 1843–1930;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"CORLEY, T. A. B.; GODLEY, ANDREW";Economic historians have focused research effort on accounting for the growth and significance of Britain's pharmaceutical industry, but little effort has so far been directed at the veterinary medicine industry, which formed an important part of the wider sector. This article addresses that gap. Factors responsible for that sector's relative insignificance until the 1950s included a general tendency to slaughter rather than to treat sick animals, the absence of advanced medicines until the innovation of sulpha drugs and antibiotics, and difficult relations with the wider pharmaceutical industry. Thereafter output of veterinary medicines increased dramatically, arising from an exponential growth in the demand for intensively farmed poultry meat. Since the 1980s a decline in the use of drugs in agriculture has caused the industry to concentrate on the health needs of domestic animals rather than those of livestock.;2011;The veterinary medicine industry in Britain in the twentieth century;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Coşgel, Metin M.; Ergene, Boğaç A.";This article examines intergenerational wealth accumulation and transmission patterns in eighteenth-century Ottoman Kastamonu (located in north-central Anatolia), by utilizing the quantitative information as found in probate estate inventories. Specifically, it explores how sons' wealth levels were determined by a number of factors. Our results indicate that the father's wealth and the duration of wealth accumulation were positively related to the son's wealth. But the number of inheritors and, for the most part, honorary titles did not influence wealth accumulation. In addition to providing valuable insights into wealth accumulation patterns in eighteenth-century Anatolia, our findings allow us to make comparisons with Britain and comment on the process of economic development in the Middle East.;2011;Intergenerational wealth accumulation and dispersion in the Ottoman Empire: observations from eighteenth-century Kastamonu;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Costa, Leonor Freire; Rocha, Maria Manuela; Araujo, T.";This article discusses agency problems in a period of market boom. It takes Portuguese trade with Brazil as a case study to discuss the impact of colonial market expansion on social capital. The hypothesis is that social capital depletion prompted an uneven distribution of information and a limited access to honest individuals, who might afford a premium to certain forms of agency. Given the states' inability to provide legal sanctioning in colonial regions, this article focuses on private-order mechanisms which were effective for selecting reputable individuals. The exploration of network analysis identifies the mechanism that responds to such an adverse environment and supports the argument that business organizations which counted on the geographical mobility of agents had comparative advantages. The approach followed in this article brings new insights on informal institutional arrangements and on itinerancy in contexts of low levels of social capital.;2011;Social capital and economic performance: trust and distrust in eighteenth-century gold shipments from Brazil;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Courtemanche, Charles; Snowden, Kenneth A.";Between 1933 and 1936 the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation purchased more than a million delinquent mortgages from private lenders and refinanced those loans for the borrowers. Its primary goal was to break the cycle of foreclosure, forced property sales and decreases in home values that was affecting local housing markets throughout the nation. We find that the volume of HOLC lending was related to measures of distress in local (county-level) housing markets and that these interventions increased 1940 median home values and homeownership rates, but not new home building.“[A] tremendous surge of residential building in the [last] decade… was matched by an ever-increasing supply of homes sold on easy terms [and only]… a small decline in prices was necessary to wipe out this equity. Unfortunately, deflationary processes are never satisfied with small declines in values. They feed upon themselves and produce results out of all proportion to their causes… In the field of real estate finance, particularly, we have depended so much upon credit that our whole value structure can be thrown out of balance by relatively slight shocks.

Cox, Gary W.;I reexamine Douglass North and Barry Weingast's argument regarding credible commitment and sovereign debt in post-revolution England. The central problem that the architects of the revolution settlement had to solve, I argue, was not the king's frequent reneging on financial commitments (a symptom), but the moral hazard that generated the kings' malfeasance (the underlying cause). The central element of the revolution settlement was thus not better holding kings to their commitments, but better holding royal advisors to account for all consequences of the Crown's policies—through what we now call ministerial responsibility.;2011;War, Moral Hazard, and Ministerial Responsibility: England After the Glorious Revolution;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Darné, Olivier; Charles, Amélie";In this paper, we examine the large shocks due to major economic or financial events that affected U.S. macroeconomic time series on the period 1860–1988, using outlier methodology. We show that most of these shocks have a temporary effect, showing that the U.S. macroeconomic time series experienced only few large permanent shifts in the long term. Most of these large shocks can be explained by major recessions and World War II as well as by monetary policy for the interest rate data. We also find that some economic events seem to have the same effect (immediate, transitory or permanent) on a number of macroeconomic series. Finally, we show that most macroeconomic time series do not seem inconsistent with a stochastic trend once we adjusted the data for these shocks.;2011;Large shocks in U.S. macroeconomic time series: 1860–1988;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Davenport, Romola J.; SCHWARZ, LEONARD; Boulton, Jeremy";Smallpox was probably the single most lethal disease in eighteenth-century Britain, but was a minor cause of death by the mid-nineteenth century. Although vaccination was crucial to the decline of smallpox, especially in urban areas, from the beginning of the nineteenth century, it remains disputed the extent to which smallpox mortality declined before vaccination. Analysis of age-specific changes in smallpox burials within the large west London parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields revealed a precipitous reduction in adult smallpox risk from the 1770s, and this pattern was duplicated in the east London parish of St Dunstan's. Most adult smallpox victims were rural migrants, and such a drop in their susceptibility is consistent with a sudden increase in exposure to smallpox in rural areas. We investigated whether this was due to the spread of inoculation, or an increase in smallpox transmission, using changes in the age patterns of child smallpox burials. Smallpox mortality rose among infants, and smallpox burials became concentrated at the youngest ages, suggesting a sudden increase in infectiousness of the smallpox virus. Such a change intensified the process of smallpox endemicization in the English population, but also made cities substantially safer for young adult migrants.;2011;The decline of adult smallpox in eighteenth-century London;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Degner, Harald;Many papers have been written about the effect of firm size on innovativeness, revealing a positive, a negative or a mixed impact. To this day, the so-called Schumpeterian hypothesis of the above-average innovativeness of large firms has neither been confirmed nor rejected, often because of insufficient data or a too-short observation period. Many studies concentrate only on a specific region or sector, or they analyze a very short time period. Windows of technological opportunities, providing technological booms for both firms and sectors, have not yet been investigated. An analysis of Germany’s chemical, metal and electrical-engineering sectors between 1877 and 1932 reveals that the sector-specific long-term relationship between firm size and innovativeness is negative, except during times of specific technological booms. In combination with firm-specific characteristics, this new aspect can contribute to a better understanding of the long-term relationship between firm size and innovativeness.;2011;Do technological booms matter?

"Dincecco, Marc; Federico, Giovanni; VINDIGNI, ANDREA";"We examine the relationships between warfare, taxation, and political change in the context of the political unification of the Italian peninsula. Using a comprehensive new database, we argue that external and internal threat environments had significant implications for the demand for military strength, which in turn had important ramifications for fiscal policy and the likelihood of constitutional reform and related improvements in the provision of nonmilitary public services. Our analytic narrative complements recent theoretical and econometric works about state capacity. By emphasizing public finances, we also uncover novel insights about the forces underlying state formation in Italy.

DODGSON, JOHN;Total factor productivity (TFP) growth in Britain's railways in the last part of the nineteenth century and the first decade of the twentieth has been widely studied, not least because it can throw light on the question of the causes of overall slowdown in industrial growth. This article is concerned with the detailed mechanics of measuring TFP growth and with the use of results to compare growth across different companies. The article disaggregates TFP growth between different activities performed by railway companies (provision of locomotive power, operation of carriages and wagons, provision of permanent way, and working of traffic), and it also develops detailed measures of capital stock and capital costs using disaggregate data on assets employed in each activity. These improvements to existing methodology reduce, rather than increase, existing estimates of TFP growth. Consequently the results confirm the previously observed conclusion that productivity growth was slow. They show that while there were significant increases in goods train operating efficiency in the first decade of the twentieth century, the additional resources that were employed meant that these increases were slow to translate into overall TFP growth.;2011;New, disaggregated, British railway total factor productivity growth estimates, 1875 to 1912;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Drelichman, Mauricio; Voth, Hans-Joachim";Philip II of Spain accumulated debts equivalent to 60% of GDP. He also defaulted four times on his short-term loans, thus becoming the first serial defaulter in history. Contrary to a common view in the literature, we show that lending to the king was profitable even under worst-case scenario assumptions. Lenders maintained long-term relationships with the crown. Losses sustained during defaults were more than compensated by profits in normal times. Defaults were not catastrophic events. In effect, short-term lending acted as an insurance mechanism, allowing the king to reduce his payments in harsh times in exchange for paying a premium in tranquil periods.;2011;Serial defaults, serial profits: Returns to sovereign lending in Habsburg Spain, 1566–1600;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Edvinsson, Sören; Lindkvist, Marie";The present article analyses social inequality in mortality in the 19th century Sundsvall region, an area that experienced rapid industrialization after 1850. The purpose of the study is to investigate whether there were social differences in mortality in this context and whether these differences increased during the industrial break-through. The expected advantages for higher social classes could not be confirmed in this environment. Instead, the best survival was found among those belonging to the agricultural sector. We found a strongly gendered pattern, with much higher mortality for and small health differences among men, while the results indicate increasing social inequality in female mortality during industrialization. The spatial pattern of mortality was pronounced and living with a partner had a strong impact on survival, particularly for men. We finally discuss the role of gender and class expectations in relation to lifestyles for the social patterning of mortality.;2011;Wealth and health in 19th Century Sweden.

ELORANTA, JARI;"Why did the League of Nations ultimately fail to achieve widespread disarmament, its most fundamental goal? This article shows that the failure of the League of Nations had two important dimensions: (1) the failure to provide adequate security guarantees for its members (like an alliance); (2) the failure of this organization to achieve the disarmament goals it set out in the 1920s and 1930s. Thus, it was doomed from the outset to fail, due to built-in institutional contradictions. It can also be modeled and analyzed as a potential military alliance. The results are fairly conclusive: The League of Nations did not function as a pure public-good alliance, which encouraged an arms race in the 1930s.";2011;Why did the League of Nations fail?;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Enflo, Kerstin;This article investigates which institutions and policies were related to the increase in European unemployment since 1970 and the productivity stagnation since the mid 1990s. By using data for 88 regions in nine European countries, national policies and institutions are analysed in a fixed-effects panel-data model to detect their relative importance after controlling for unobservable regional factors. The main finding is that institutions only started to matter after the oil crisis. The strongest institutional effects on employment came from the net reservation wages and employment protection laws. The institutional effects on productivity were mainly channelled through the employment productivity trade-off. By restricting the supply of labour, these effects were positive on productivity in the short run. However, the article shows that the long-run effects were negative and that there may be institutional roots to the European productivity slow-down in the 1990s.;2011;The institutional roots of post-war European economic underperformance: a regional approach;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Given that financial development is regularly included among the conditions for economic growth and catch-up of developing nations, this article adds to our understanding of the multiple impacts of the mass migration phenomenon on the economies of emigration countries.;2011;Remittances, capital flows and financial development during the mass migration period, 1870-1913;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Federico, Giovanni;This article argues that market integration should be measured as σ-convergence over the largest possible sample of markets. Its focus is the European market for wheat, rye and candles from the middle of the eighteenth century to the eve of the first globalization. Price dispersion for cereals remained constant until the outbreak of the French Wars, then it increased abruptly. It began to decline after the end of the wars, and the process continued steadily until an all-time low was reached in the 1860s. Domestic and international integration contributed in roughly the same proportions to integration in the long run, but the latter was much more important in accounting for medium-term changes. These results suggest that the level of integration was determined for most of the period by war and political events, with a substantial contribution from a fall in transport costs in the second quarter of the nineteenth century. By contrast, there is very little evidence of integration in the market for candles.;2011;When did European markets integrate?;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Some basic questions about Italy's economic history are briefly considered, including the origins and extent of the north?south divide, the role of migration and regional policy in shaping the pattern of regional inequality, and the positioning of Italy in the international debate on regional convergence, where it stands out because of the long-run persistence of its disparities.;2011;Regional value added in Italy, 1891–2001, and the foundation of a long-term picture;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

White U.S.-born males living before age 5 in lower SES households (measured by father's occupation and family home ownership) who survive to age 70 die younger and are more likely to die from heart disease than those living before age 5 in higher SES households.

We provide a description of the rise of the market for grades and gather information on the products sold, price schedules, etc. We find that rating agencies did exhibit features similar to those that have attracted considerable interest recently: namely, they did not react until the crisis had already begun and then implemented massive downgrades. We conclude by suggesting that, given the less than stellar record of the agencies, their emergence in the 1930s as a regulatory tool will have to be explained in future research.;2011;To err is human: US rating agencies and the interwar foreign government debt crisis;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Földvári, Péter; van Leeuwen, Bas";The development in the working of markets has been an important topic in economic history for decades. The volatility of market prices is often used as an indicator of market efficiency in the broadest sense. Yet, the way in which volatility is estimated often makes it difficult to compare price volatility across regions or over time for two reasons. First, if prices are non-stationary, the variance is inflated. Second, the variance of commodity prices contains information on a number of region- and time-specific factors that are not related to market efficiency. Hence, the popular coefficient of variation and related indicators are not adequate measures of the efficiency of markets and are incomparable across regions. As a solution, we suggest using a conditional heteroscedasticity model to estimate the residual (conditional) variance of commodity prices. This measure reflects how markets react to unexpected events and can therefore be seen as a measure of market efficiency. Using this approach on grain prices from the Early Modern Pisa, Paris, Vienna, and Japan, we find that the residual price volatility had declined (and market efficiency increased) in the European markets in the late sixteenth century while it remained stable in Japan.;2011;What can price volatility tell us about market efficiency?

Foreman-Peck, James;For several centuries before the First World War women's age at first marriage in the west of Europe was higher than in the east (and in the rest of the world). In their low mortality regimes Western Europeans chose lower fertility in part through a higher female age at marriage. This allowed women to increase their human capital both formally and informally in the years before child bearing so that more informed mothers brought up better educated offspring. The demographic pattern influenced the stock of human capital and directly contributed to Western Europe's development advantage.

Frankema, Ewout H.P.;Colonial state institutions are widely cited as a root cause of sub-Saharan African underdevelopment, but the opinions differ on the channels of causation. Were African colonial states ruled by near absolutist governments who strived to maximize revenue extraction in order to strengthen their grip on native African societies? Or did European powers build ‘states without substance’, governed with minimal resources and effort, failing to invest in basic public goods? This paper develops an analytical framework for comparing colonial tax and spending patterns and applies it to eight British African colonies (1880–1940). We show that colonial fiscal systems did not adhere to a uniform logic, that minimalism prevailed in West Africa, extractive features were more pronounced in East Africa, and that Mauritius revealed characteristics of a developmental state already before 1940.;2011;Colonial taxation and government spending in British Africa, 1880–1940: Maximizing revenue or minimizing effort?;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
FREEMAN, MARK;This article, focusing on Seebohm Rowntree's poverty surveys, considers the importance and durability of the concept of secondary poverty. It argues that secondary poverty was a central component of Rowntree's first survey of York, carried out in 1899, and in his lectures and writing in the Edwardian period. Moreover, secondary poverty remained an important feature of Rowntree's analysis during the interwar years and after the Second World War, and was adopted by other researchers in various ways. Although secondary poverty was not seriously examined in the published version of Rowntree's 1936 York survey, there is evidence that it was originally intended to feature, and it is clear that impressionistic evidence of poverty was gathered by Rowntree's investigators, as had been the case in 1899. Moreover, although it was completely expunged from the third survey of York, carried out by Rowntree and Lavers in 1950, a separate inquiry into secondary poverty was carried out in the early 1950s, with a number of prominent supporters. Subsequently, dissatisfaction with income-based definitions and measurements of poverty allowed the concept of secondary poverty to continue to exercise an influence on the study of poverty in the postwar period.;2011;Seebohm Rowntree and secondary poverty, 1899–1954;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Using five occupational classes and controlling for year, age at marriage, urban/rural residence, and literacy, we found no evidence for the emergence of a socioeconomic gradient in mortality.

"Gazeley, Ian; Newell, A.; Scott, Peter M.";This article presents an analysis of British urban working-class housing conditions in 1904, using a rediscovered survey. We investigate overcrowding and find major regional differences. Scottish households in the survey were more overcrowded despite being less poor. Investigating the causes of this overcrowding, we find little support for supply-side theories or for the idea that the Scottish households in our survey experienced particularly great variations in income, causing them to commit to overly modest accommodation. We present evidence that is consistent with idea that particularly tough Scottish tenancy and local tax laws caused excess overcrowding. We also provide evidence that Scottish workers had a relatively high preference for food, rather than housing, expenditure, which can be at least partly attributed to their inheritance of more communal patterns of urban living.;2011;Why was urban overcrowding much more severe in Scotland than in the rest of the British Isles?

This is well above Rowntree's estimate of primary poverty for York in 1899 and high in the range that Bowley found in northern towns in 1912?13. The skill gradient of poverty is steep; for instance, among labourers' households, the poverty rates are close to 50 per cent.

In seventeenth-century Holland the structure, size, and issuing rates of the debt were determined by investors' preferences, wealth accumulation, and changing private investment opportunities. The growth of savings enabled the creation of a huge debt largely with short-term bills. Issuing rates dropped because savings outstripped private investment alternatives. In Holland, and probably elsewhere as well, credible commitment and efficient fiscal institutions were necessary, but not sufficient to create liquid secondary markets and low costs of capital.;2011;Public Finance and Economic Growth: The Case of Holland in the Seventeenth Century;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Geraghty, Thomas M.; Wiseman, Thomas";Before about 1900, most strikes in the United States were either won or lost by the workers who called them. Relatively few strikes ended in any sort of compromise. Sometime during the last decade of the 19th century, however, the pattern begins to change, with the fraction of strikes ending in compromise peaking at nearly half during World Wars I and II. What explains these changes in strike outcomes between the late 19th century and 1945? We explore the effects of macroeconomic conditions, industrial organization and product markets, labor organization, law and public policy, and immigration and trade on the costs and benefits of achieving strike compromises. We find that temporary government intervention in settling strikes during World War I helped move labor and management away from an adversarial equilibrium, and thus allowed growing acceptance of organized labor to be reflected in a permanent increase in the rate of compromise. We conclude that changes in the nature of strike outcomes represent an important and neglected aspect of broader changes in the place of organized labor in the American political economy.;2011;Conflict and compromise: Changes in U.S. strike outcomes, 1880 to 1945;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Gupta, Bishnupriya;Clark and Wolcott attribute the low productivity of Indian cotton textile workers to their preference for low work effort, and suggest that unions resisted an increase in work intensity. This article argues that low wages were due to surplus labour in agriculture. Low wages allowed the persistence of managerial inefficiencies and resulted in low productivity and work effort. It uses firm-level data from all the textile producing regions in India to examine the relationship between unions and labour productivity.

"Haggerty, John; Haggerty, Sheryllynne";Recently historians have complicated their understanding of networks. In particular, they have started to assess the role of networks in civic and formal arenas. This paper posits a quantitative methodology for a more nuanced and sophisticated analysis of mercantile networks within this environment. It uses visual analytics of Liverpool's business networks comprising political, trade, social and cultural institutions to assess their role in the changing social and economic climate during the period 1750–1810. This paper demonstrates the dynamic role of networks in the shaping of a metropolitan economy and the interplay between the two. In addition, it posits that, as is the case for regional clusters, there is a life cycle of networks. In this way, we are able to see how the networks sustained, nurtured and transformed social and economic activity during this period.;2011;The life cycle of a metropolitan business network: Liverpool 1750–1810;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Haines, Michael R.;This paper deals with the issue of using infant and childhood mortality as an indicator of inequality. The case is that of the United States in the 20th century. Using microdata from the 1900 and 1910 Integrated Public Use Microsamples (IPUMS), published data from the Birth Registration Area in the 1920s, results from a number of surveys, and the Linked Birth & Infant Death Files from the National Center for Health Statistics for 1991, infant and child mortality can be related to such other variables as occupation of father or mother, education of father or mother, family income, race, ethnicity, and residence. The evidence shows that, although there have been large absolute reductions in the level of infant and child mortality rates and also a reduction in the absolute levels of differences across socioeconomic groups, relative inequality has not diminished over the 20th century.;2011;Inequality and infant and childhood mortality in the United States in the twentieth century;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
HARRINGTON, MELANIE;This article examines the archives of the earls of Derby alongside related governmental papers to provide a new perspective on the Royalist land sales. It revisits Thirsk's pioneering work and, while upholding its significance, argues that historians can go further in understanding the social and economic consequences of the land sales. The identity, motivation, and activity of the Interregnum purchasers are re-assessed, and it is suggested that the role of tenants was greater and more complex than has been appreciated. The case study will hopefully shed further light on a part of the Revolution land settlement story which has been underplayed.;2011;The earl of Derby and his tenants: sales of Royalist land during the Interregnum revisited;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Hatton, Timothy J.;The first half of the twentieth century saw rapid improvements in the health and height of British children. Average height and health can be related to infant mortality through a positive selection effect and a negative scarring effect. Examining town-level panel data on the heights of school children, no evidence is found for the selection effect, but there is some support for the scarring effect. The results suggest that the improvement in the disease environment, as reflected by the decline in infant mortality, increased average height by about half a centimetre per decade in the first half of the twentieth century.;2011;Infant mortality and the health of survivors: Britain, 1910–50;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Henning, Martin; Enflo, Kerstin; Andersson, Fredrik N. G.";Using a novel dataset of regional GDP per worker from 1860 to 2009, this paper analyzes communalities in regional long-term growth trajectories for 24 Swedish regions. Wavelet Analysis and Principal Component Analysis are used to decompose regional growth trajectories and assess the extent that regional growth patterns share common trends and cyclical properties. The study found that regional growth trends show strong common features among groups of regions in Sweden. Natural-resource-rich regions benefited from the First Industrial Revolution. Contrary to regional development in many other European economies, a growth surge in Sweden later benefited virtually the whole country during the Second Industrial Revolution. The countrywide trend of growth slowed in the 1970s when the metropolitan regions became the main growth engines. In mid- and short-term cyclical movements, regions display more heterogeneous growth patterns, and we find evidence of mid-term, sequential lead–lag patterns in regional growth, especially between urban cores and the periphery.;2011;Trends and cycles in regional economic growth: How spatial differences shaped the Swedish growth experience from 1860–2009;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Hetherington, Bruce W.; Kower, Peter J.";This paper answers the following question. If returns from smuggling cotton and contraband through the blockade of Confederate ports during the American Civil War were significantly lower than earnings from alternative investments, why did private firms so quickly adopt costly purpose-built steam ships in the face of the strengthening Northern blockade? First, we note that the rate of diffusion of steam ships, specially designed to run the blockade significantly exceeded any reported for innovations from the late 19th or early 20th century. Second, we correct an error in Stanley Lebergott's (1981) seminal work and conclude that that returns to infamous steamer, the Banshee (I) of 700% to be quite plausible. This finding of high returns is confirmed by two other historical sources, which have not been previously used. Additionally, we calculate that investors in the one of the leading blockade running firms, known as the Bee Company, earned in excess of 86% return on their investment, over double the profits previously reported. Finally, we demonstrate that adoption of purpose-built ships, significantly decreased the arrival rate of capture, thus increasing expected profits.;2011;Technological diffusion and the Union blockade;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Hickson, Charles R.; Turner, John D.; YE, QING";This article assesses the contribution of the various industrial sectors to the growth of the British equity market in the 1825?70 period. It also provides estimates of the rates of return on these industrial sectors in this period. The article then proceeds to examine whether differences in rates of return across the various sectors can be explained by risk or other financial factors. One of the main findings is that the relatively high rates of return in the banking, insurance, and miscellaneous sectors appear to be in some measure explained by the presence of extended liability and uncalled capital.;2011;The rate of return on equity across industrial sectors on the British stock market, 1825–70;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Hillmann, Henning; Gathmann, Christina";Using a novel data set on 2,483 British privateering cruises, we show that state-licensed raiding of commercial vessels was a popular and flourishing business among merchants that took a serious toll on enemy trade from 1689 to 1815. Why, then, did privateering merchants gradually turn away from these profitable endeavors? We show that the expansion of overseas trade increased the opportunity costs for merchants and resulted in the decline of privateering. Our findings document that the decline of privateering had as much to do with an expanding maritime economy as with the rising naval power of the British state.;2011;Overseas Trade and the Decline of Privateering;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Hoag, Christopher;Moen and Tallman (J Econ Hist 60:145–163, 2000) show that clearinghouse membership reduced deposit contraction of commercial banks and trusts during the panic of 1907.

In contrast to the previous results, clearinghouse membership does not substantially alleviate deposit contractions in 1893. Most likely, less aggressive lending during the crisis in 1893 explains the different results.;2011;Clearinghouse membership and deposit contraction during the Panic of 1893;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Huff, Gregg; Angeles, Luis";This article uses new data to analyze the impact on Southeast Asian urbanization of globalization and industrialization in the world economy's core countries between the 1870s and World War II. Dramatic falls in transport costs and free trade, enforced, if necessary, by colonial rule, combined to open vast frontier areas throughout Southeast Asia to global commerce and create a handful of large urban centres. These cities, through linking Southeast Asian primary commodity exporters to world markets, grew predominantly as part of the global economy. Our econometric analysis shows that measures of globalization — in particular industrial production in the world core and international transport costs — are much better predictors of the size of Southeast Asia's main cities than domestic factors such as total population, GDP per capita, land area or government expenditure.;2011;Globalization, industrialization and urbanization in Pre-World War II Southeast Asia;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Jacks, David S.;This article explores the means by which warfare influences domestic commodity markets. It is argued that England during the French Wars provides an ideal testing ground. Four categories of explanatory variables are taken as likely sources of documented changes in English commodity price disintegration during this period: weather, trade, policy and wartime events. Empirically, increases in price dispersion are related to all of the above categories. However, the primary means identified by which warfare influenced domestic commodity market integration was through international trade linkages and the arrival of news regarding wartime events.;2011;Foreign wars, domestic markets: England, 1793-1815;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"James, John A.; Suto, Isao";This paper pools data from independent household surveys of Japanese workers roughly spanning the Taishō period (1912–1926), a time before private-business or government-provided social safety nets. First, we construct estimates of permanent and transitory income and then estimate saving functions consistent with intertemporal optimization. The saving behaviour of Japanese worker households is in turn compared with that of American worker households before World War I, a time when they too lacked access to general social services. The estimated marginal propensities to save out of permanent and transitory incomes were quite similar for Japanese and American worker households, but the Japanese ones saved more at a given level of income. The economic environment facing Japanese workers, however, seemed to be no riskier than that facing American workers. We attribute instead this result primarily to the widespread postal savings banks in Japan which increased the convenience and decreased the risk of saving.;2011;Early twentieth-century Japanese worker saving: precautionary behaviour before a social safety net;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"James, John A.; Weiman, David F.";Focusing on the New York banking sector, we analyze a neglected, but profound impact of the National Banking Acts. By resisting federal banking legislation and “boycotting” newly chartered national banks, the New York Clearing House Association members created market opportunities for the new entrants to dominate the correspondent banking market. The new entrants’ aggressive tactics including interest payments on deposits increased their vulnerability to panicky withdrawals by country banks. They also magnified conflicts of interest within the clearinghouse, which weakened its central banking functions and further destabilized the macroeconomy.;2011;The National Banking Acts and the Transformation of New York City Banking During the Civil War Era;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Jaremski, Matthew;Bank notes were the largest component of the antebellum money supply despite losses as high as 5 percent in some years. Using a comprehensive bank-level panel of note discounts in New York City and Philadelphia, I explain this contradiction by showing that the secondary market reduced losses by accurately discounting notes based on their individual risk of default. Note discounts were almost exclusively sensitive to those factors which increased a bank's probability of default: specie suspensions, falling bond prices, and undiversified portfolios. Thus, by accounting for a bank's composition and environment, the market protected noteholders and allowed notes to circulate throughout the economy.;2011;Bank-Specific Default Risk in the Pricing of Bank Note Discounts;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Jong, Herman J. de; WOLTJER, PIETER";During the interwar period the manufacturing productivity gap between the US and the UK became much larger than existing estimates suggest. In this article a new comparison of US/UK productivity levels for 1935 is presented, utilizing a more rigorous methodology to revise the widely used, but methodologically outdated, benchmark comparison by Rostas that was published in 1948. Secondly, the comparison is extended to take account of variations in input prices, and it is shown that double deflation has a substantial effect on the new benchmark, particularly at the industry level. Thirdly, labour input is adjusted for actual hours worked. US manufacturing displayed a much higher level of comparative productivity for the key industries of the second industrial revolution, such as chemicals and engineering. These results support revisionist accounts of the depression's strengthening of US productivity leadership.;2011;Depression dynamics: a new estimate of the Anglo-American manufacturing productivity gap in the interwar period;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The article is based on the collection of extensive new data indicating different trends in draught power availability and the efficiency of its use in different countries of Europe. This article shows that the proposition does not hold, and demonstrates that, although towards the end of the nineteenth century England had relatively high numbers of draught animals per agricultural worker, it also had low number of workers and animals per hectare, indicating the high efficiency of muscle power, rather than an abundance of such power. The higher efficiency was related to a specialization on less labour-intensive farming and a preference for horses over oxen.;2011;Energy availability from livestock and agricultural productivity in Europe, 1815–1913: a new comparison;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

However, this benefit fades in a few years. Further we find no evidence of a spike in mortality among rural migrants as they encountered the more severe disease environment of cities, instead it seems their initially superior physical human capital was depleted over time.;2011;The health cost of living in a city: The case of France at the end of the 19th century;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Any technological difficulties in the use of coke pig iron in finery forges were overcome before 1728. However, the iron industry was depressed in the 1730s due to Russian bar iron imports.

The findings indicate that families migrated to the city such that the educational attainment of their children would be maximized, and that there is a positive correlation between family migration and children being apprentices in urban areas. The results suggest that rural?urban migration was powered not only by the exploitation of rural?urban wage gaps but also by aspirations to engage in human capital investment.;2011;Did children's education matter?

By autumn, political preferences among smallholders and middling farmers had shifted in favour of protectionism too. As these groups were not specialised in the production of import-competing goods, we assume that the political landslide in the autumn elections can be attributed to a loss of trust in the government.;2011;The political economy of agricultural protection: Sweden 1887;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Newly digitized apprenticeship indenture records for 1600–1749 offer little evidence that personal ties strongly shaped apprentice recruitment. The typical London apprentices had no identifiable tie to their master through kin or place of origin. Migrant apprentices' fathers were generally outside the craft sector.

Metz, Rainer;Although the long-wave phenomenon has long been discussed in economic, social and political sciences, there is still highly controversial discussion about the methods of providing empirical evidence of such swings as regular cycles in economic time series. This article gives an overview about the historical development of time series methods to investigate such long-term oscillations in historical time series and to proof their regularity. It starts with a brief presentation of the methods used by Kondratieff and shows them in the context of classical business cycle analysis. It continues with ARIMA methodology and spectral analysis, which have been found to be appropriate when long waves are conceived as growth cycles. We then introduce the filter-design approach that was seen as a perfect solution to the hitherto unsolved problem of dividing trend and long waves in the low-frequency domain.

Munck, B. de;This article contributes to the debate about the early modern craft guilds' rationale through the lens of apprenticeship. Based on a case study of the Antwerp manufacturing guilds, it argues that apprenticeship should be understood from the perspective of ‘distributional conflicts’. Fixed terms of service and masterpieces guarded the guilds' labour market monopsony, enabling masters to distribute the available skilled and unskilled labour among members (among other ways, through the restriction of the number of apprentices per master). Although from the perspective of product quality, this may have enabled masters to prevent adverse selection, the introduction of standardized apprenticeship requirements was the result of social and rent-seeking concerns.;2011;Gilding golden ages: perspectives from early modern Antwerp on the guild debate, c. 1450 - c. 1650;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Nafziger, Steven;Russia's emancipation of the serfs was accompanied by numerous other measures aimed at modernizing the Tsarist economy and society. Among these ‘Great Reforms’ was the creation of a new institution of local government – the zemstvo – which has received comparatively little attention from economic historians. This quasi-democratic form of local government played an important role in expanding the provision of public goods and services in the half-century leading up to the Russian Revolution. This article utilizes archival records and contemporary evidence to outline the zemstvo's role in Russian society and describe its political structure. The article then presents a newly collected panel data set that includes information on the allocation of political rights within the zemstvo, spending and revenue decisions by district zemstva, and a variety of other socio-economic indicators. With these data, I explore whether the electoral structure of the zemstvo allowed the newly emancipated peasantry to voice their preferences over spending levels and tax rates. I find that the district zemstvo with greater political representation from the peasantry shifted taxes away from communal property and spent more per capita, especially on education. However, these effects did not derive from a direct voting mechanism but most likely arose out of the interaction between peasant representation and more liberal elements of the noble class. This study initiates a broader research agenda into the zemstvo's place in Russian economic history and contributes to the literature on the political economy of public good provision in developing societies.;2011;Did Ivan's vote matter?

Nicholas, Tom;Matching 2,777 R&D firms in surveys conducted by the National Research Council between 1921 and 1938 with U.S. patents reveals that 59 percent of all firms and 88 percent of publicly traded firms patented. These shares are much higher than those observed for modern R&D firms. Industry, firm size and the location of R&D facilities relative to major cities are shown to be important determinants of the propensity to patent. The effect of these factors remained constant across the 1920s and the Depression years suggesting that the tradeoff between patent disclosure and secrecy did not change over time.;2011;Did R&D Firms Used to Patent?

Nicholas, Tom;Independent inventors accounted for approximately half of all patents in Britain and Japan by 1930, despite the rise of the corporate economy and the spread of industrial R&D. A mixture of patent renewal and historical citations data reveals that the quality of independent invention was high. Active markets for inventions created incentives for independents, especially in large cities like London and Tokyo, which dominated spatially. Alongside evidence for the US, the findings show that in countries with different patent systems and at varying stages of economic development, a key component of overall inventive activity originated from outside the boundaries of firms.;2011;Independent invention during the rise of the corporate economy in Britain and Japan;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Nicholas, Tom;Explanations of Japanese technological modernization from the late nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century have increasingly focused on domestic capabilities as opposed to the traditional emphasis on knowledge transfers from the West. Yet, the literature is mostly qualitative and it lacks a comparative context. This article presents quantitative metrics derived from patent data covering Japan, the United States, Britain and Germany and it also exploits non-patent based sources. The evidence shows that Japanese domestic inventive activity exhibited a pattern of rapid modernization to the technology frontier in terms of its level, sectoral distribution and quality. Domestic capabilities were much stronger than is often supposed in accounts that stress the prevalence of Western technology diffusion. A long run expansion in indigenous development set a favorable foundation for the economic growth miracle Japan experienced after the Second World War.;2011;The origins of Japanese technological modernization;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Nuvolari, Alessandro; Tartari, Valentina";We examine the potentialities of a new indicator measuring the value of English patents in the period 1617–1841. The indicator is based on the relative visibility of each individual patent in the contemporary technical and legal literature as summarized in Bennet Woodcroft's Reference Index of Patents of Invention. We conclude that the indicator provides a reasonable proxy for the value of patents and that it can be usefully employed to shed light on the timing and scope of innovation during the Industrial Revolution. In particular, our indicator offers a suitable reconciliation between the patent records evidence and the Crafts–Harley view of the Industrial Revolution.;2011;Bennet Woodcroft and the value of English patents, 1617–1841;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Nuvolari, Alessandro; VERSPAGEN, BART; Tunzelmann, Nick von";We examine the diffusion of steam technology across British counties during the eighteenth century. First, we provide new estimates for the regional variations in the timing, pace and extent of usage of steam engines. Our main data source is an updated version of the list of steam engines erected in Britain during the eighteenth century originally compiled by Kanefsky and Robey (Technol Cult 21:161–186, 1980). Following a rather established approach for analysing the diffusion of new technologies we fit S-shaped growth functions to the data on the numbers of steam engines installed in each county. In this way, we are able to provide a comprehensive appraisal of the relative speed of the diffusion process in different counties. Second, in order to assess the relative importance of the variables shaping the diffusion of steam power technology, we study the relationship between the number of steam engines installed in each county and localization factors such as coal prices, availability of water sites, number of textile mills and number of blast furnaces.;2011;The early diffusion of the steam engine in Britain, 1700–1800: a reappraisal;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
O'Brien, Patrick K.;Institutions that promoted or restrained early modern economic growth were established, sustained, and often destroyed by states. Yet their economic history lacks either a fundamental theory or grounded narrative for state formation in the east or the west. This survey of a library of recent research in the conjoined histories of national taxation and finance deploys a stage theory and reciprocal comparisons to explain when, how, and why England's political elites constructed a fiscal constitution for an island state that provided the external security, internal order, and successful mercantilism to carry the economy to a plateau of possibilities for a precocious industrial revolution.;2011;The nature and historical evolution of an exceptional fiscal state and its possible significance for the precocious commercialization and industrialization of the British economy from Cromwell to Nelson;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Ohlsson, H.;The objective of this article is to study how people change their behaviour when taxes change. I follow the revenue from gift, inheritance and estate taxes in Sweden over more than a century. Second, I focus on a unique episode during the second half of the 1940s when gifts and gift tax revenue exploded. I have access to aggregate tax revenue data since 1884. Moreover, I have constructed a rich micro-data set of all gifts reported during the period 1942–9 in one county. A first main result is that gifts, inheritances and estates were never important sources of tax revenue. Tax revenue as a share of GDP and total government revenue had already reached peaks in the 1930s. The role of these taxes has instead primarily been equity and to provide integrity for other tax bases. Second, expectations were important. Gift tax revenue during the 1940s started to increase long before a new estate tax and increased wealth taxation were decided and implemented. The increase began even before the legislative process started. Third, economic power and economic control were important. Parents gave to their children to avoid taxes, but only when the expected gain became large enough and in ways that left them with as much economic power as possible.;2011;The legacy of the Swedish gift and inheritance tax, 1884-2004;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
OKAZAKI, TETSUJI;The Japanese aircraft industry, which was very small scale before the Second World War, became Japan's largest manufacturing industry by the end of the war. This article explores the basis for the growth of the aircraft industry during this time by focusing on Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Company's No. 5 Works. It was revealed that during the war, the supply of basic inputs increased substantially: labour force, equipment, and ?machinery parts? were in sufficient supply and none of these was a binding constraint on production. The binding constraint existed in the supply of ?special parts?. In other words, aircraft production expanded as the supply of special parts increased. This increase in the supply of special parts and still faster growth in the supply of machinery parts came about through the expansion of the supplier network in terms of both the number of suppliers and the geographical area in which they were located. These findings imply that outsourcing played a key role in the growth of aircraft production in wartime Japan.;2011;The supplier network and aircraft production in wartime Japan;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Pamuk, Sevket; Williamson, Jeffrey G.";India and Britain were much bigger players in the eighteenth-century world market for manufactures than were Egypt, the Levant, and the core of the Ottoman Empire, but these eastern Mediterranean regions did export carpets, silks, and other textiles to Europe and the east. By the middle of the nineteenth century, they had lost most of their export market and much of their domestic market to globalization forces and rapid productivity growth in European manufacturing. How different was the Ottoman experience from the rest of the poor periphery? Was de-industrialization more or less pronounced? Was the terms of trade effect bigger or smaller? How much of Ottoman de-industrialization was due to falling world trade barriers such as ocean transport revolutions and European liberal trade policy, how much due to factory-based productivity advance in Europe, how much to declining Ottoman competitiveness in manufacturing, how much to Ottoman railroads penetrating the interior, and how much to Ottoman policy?

Pensieroso, Luca;The Great Depression of the 1930s is again on the frontier of research in macroeconomics. Researchers working in the real business cycle (RBC) tradition have recently started to apply their theoretical apparatus to the event. This paper discusses the result of their work and assesses the role of history and macroeconomics in analysing the Great Depression. I argue that the breaking of the depression taboo in macroeconomics has been a desirable completion of the cliometric revolution: no historical event should be exempt from a dispassionate quantitative analysis. On the other hand, the substantive contribution of RBC models is not yet sufficient to establish a new historiography of the Great Depression.;2011;Real business cycle models of the Great Depression;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Rei, Claudia;In the sixteenth century, European countries engaged in long-distance trade with the East. Despite sharing the same objectives and technology, Portugal opted for a crown monopoly, England, the Netherlands, and Sweden franchised trade to private merchants, whereas in Denmark and France, king and merchants shared control. The financial condition of the crown appears to have been relevant for the monarchs' decision. I provide an economic mechanism to illuminate the historical variation in terms of the differences in relative endowments of king and merchants within each country. I also explore the implications of control allocation using archival data on labor compensation and shipping technology. Differences in the long run performance of merchant empires suggest a major impact of organization.;2011;The organization of Eastern merchant empires;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"RICHTER, RALF; STREB, JOCHEN";Today, German machine toolmakers accuse their Chinese competitors of violating patent rights and imitating German technology. A century ago, German machine toolmakers used the same methods to imitate American technology. To understand the dynamics of this catching-up process, we use patent statistics to analyze firms’ activities between 1877 and 1932. We show that German firms deployed imitating strategies in the late nineteenth century and the 1920s to catch-up to their American competitors. The German administration supported this strategy by stipulating a patent law that discriminated against foreign patent holders and by delaying the granting of patents to foreign applicants.;2011;Catching-Up and Falling Behind: Knowledge Spillover from American to German Machine Toolmakers;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The fund then forced the Bourse to search for mechanisms to control moral hazard. With new archival data, we describe the evolving regulatory regime and analyze the determinants of broker failures.

Rousseau, Peter L.;The rapid growth of deposits in New York over the late nineteenth century is often attributed to the release of pent-up demand for transactions services. I advance a complementary explanation that emphasizes the market for bank shares. The stock market was important because it generated quotations that signaled depositors about the condition of individual banks as innovations in banking practices allowed confidence to grow. A new database of prices, dividends, and balance sheet items for traded banks and a series of dynamic panel models show that fluctuations in bank prices influenced the course of the expansion.;2011;The Market for Bank Stocks and the Rise of Deposit Banking in New York City, 1866–1897;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Factors that encouraged this trend included the issue of less risky types of investments, and legal changes relating to married women's property.

Santiago Caballero, Carlos;This paper studies the evolution of income inequality in central Spain during the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, taking as case study the province of Guadalajara. The first part of the paper presents the sources and the dataset that was created to estimate income inequality using grain tithes. The second section shows that through the period grain represented the lion share of total income and therefore that it can be used as a reliable proxy. The following part of the paper introduces an analysis of income inequality in the province during the period 1690–1800 and concludes that inequality decreased during the last third of the eighteenth century. Finally the paper addresses this unexpected result and concludes that it was consequence of the success of the land reform carried out by the central government in the late 1760s. The reform was a success in Guadalajara, thanks to the characteristics of its population and the lack of bargaining power of pressure groups.;2011;Income inequality in central Spain, 1690–1800;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Sbrana, Giacomo; Silvestrini, Andrea";This paper focuses on the core inflation measurement in Italy using univariate (national-level inflation) vs. multivariate (city-level inflation) models during the period 1970–2006. We derive algebraic expressions that allow comparison between the reduced form parameters of univariate and multivariate local level models in the context of contemporaneous and temporal aggregation. We illustrate the relevance of these theoretical results for the empirical analysis of time series. Using Italian data, we find that multivariate and univariate models extract similar core inflation measures when analyzing the moderate-low inflation period. In contrast, the two competing models yield different trends when modeling the Great Inflation period.;2011;Measuring core inflation in Italy comparing aggregate vs. disaggregate price data;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Schenk, Niels; van POPPEL, FRANS W.

Population registers and personal cards covering the period from 1850 to 2004 for all Dutch provinces were used to reconstruct individual life histories of 14,900 births. For men we did not find an effect of the social class of origin (using two different SES-classifications) on mortality in age group 18 to 35. We also did not observe an effect of own social class on mortality after age 35. For women effects of social class of origin and social class of husband were generally absent as well. Our conclusion is that the standard ideas about the negative effects of processes of industrialization and urbanization on the duration of life do not seem to apply to the Netherlands. Where one lived mattered more for survival than the social class one belonged to.;2011;Social class, social mobility and mortality in the Netherlands, 1850–2004;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Studying social inequality in mortality in Geneva from 1625 to 2005, we use historical mortality data published by different authors and contemporary data drawn from an ongoing research project. The comparison over four centuries gives evidence to both the constancy and convergence hypotheses. Mortality is systematically lower-than-average among elites on the one hand, but on the other hand the difference between the top and the bottom of the social ladder is decreasing over time.;2011;Long-term changes in social mortality differentials, Geneva, 1625–2004;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Scott, Peter M.; SPADAVECCHIA, ANNA";Britain's 1919 introduction of a 48-hour week for industrial workers has been highlighted as a key factor depressing its relative labour productivity. This largely ignores both any potential offset to lower hours from higher hourly productivity and the fact that the 48-hour week was also introduced in almost all other industrialized nations (generally involving substantially greater reductions in hours). We examine the international context and the short-term impact on British productivity, focusing on three major export industries?coal, cotton, and iron and steel. Britain did not suffer any significant relative productivity loss in these industries, while reduced working hours are shown to have been partially compensated for by higher hourly productivity.;2011;Did the 48-hour week damage Britain's industrial competitiveness?;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Scott, Peter M.; WALKER, JAMES T.";Department stores represented one of the most advertising-intensive sectors of American interwar retailing. Yet it has been argued that a competitive spiral of high advertising spending, to match the challenge of other local department stores, contributed to an inflation of operating costs that eroded long-term competitiveness. We test these claims, using both qualitative archival data and establishment-level national data sets. The quantitative analysis confirms that the relationship between advertising expenditure and sales deteriorated markedly over the period, but indicates that the growing negative impact of retaliatory advertising by rival department stores was less important than contemporaries perceived.;2011;Sales and Advertising Expenditure for Interwar American Department Stores;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Seltzer, Andrew; Sammartino, André";Studies across a wide range of countries have shown that relatively few workers have received year-to-year wage cuts since the Second World War. However, there is very little micro-level evidence from earlier years, when lower inflation rates and a less regulated labour market may have led to stronger downwards pressure on wages. This paper examines wage adjustment at the Victorian Railways, Australia, between 1902 and 1921. It is shown that, despite strong downwards pressure on wages, nominal wages were rigid downwards and a high proportion of triennial wage changes were exactly zero. Even for workers with very long tenure and in years when the national price level declined, wage cuts were rare. We also show that the characteristics of workers whose wages were unchanged were very similar to those receiving wage cuts. Finally, we show that unlike the wages of incumbent staff, entry wages for new junior staff frequently declined from year to year.;2011;Nominal wage rigidity prior to compulsory arbitration: evidence from the Victorian Railways, 1902–1921;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Seltzer, Andrew J.;"Women were first employed in large numbers by the British banking industry during the First World War, and were an essential part of the industry's labour force thereafter. During the interwar period, women were often confined to routine back office positions, and could not advance past the level of clerk. Evidence from Williams Deacon's Bank shows that the salaries of younger women were very similar to their male counterparts; however, an ever-widening gender pay gap emerged after about 5years seniority. The main reasons for this pay gap were higher exit rates for women, largely due to marriage bars, and lower returns to seniority. Promotion restrictions, though ubiquitous, account for a relatively small proportion of the gender pay gap. Despite the pay gap, the marriage bar, and the lack of promotion opportunities, a sizable proportion of female clerks were very loyal to the Bank and remained for 10 or more years. This was due to the absence of better opportunities elsewhere in the labour market.";2011;Female salaries and careers in British banking, 1915–41;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"SHEPARD, ALEXANDRA; SPICKSLEY, JUDITH";This article introduces a new source for assessing the distribution of wealth in early modern England derived from witness depositions taken by the church courts. It discusses the accuracy of statements of ?worth? provided by thousands of witnesses between the mid-sixteenth and later seventeenth centuries, and uses the monetary estimates of worth in goods that the majority of deponents supplied to assess the changing distribution of personal wealth. We argue that this data supports recent claims that the pre-industrial English economy experienced significant levels of economic growth, while showing that its benefits were increasingly unevenly distributed between different social groups. In particular, the century after 1550 witnessed spectacular increases in yeoman worth that outstripped inflation by a factor of 10. The relative wealth of yeomen was also underpinned by its more secure distribution over the life cycle which further compounded the differences between them and other social groups.;2011;Worth, age, and social status in early modern England;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Stobart, Jon;"The country house is well recognized as a site of elite patronage, an important vehicle of social and political ambition, and a statement of power and taste. Yet we know relatively little about the networks of supply and purchasing patterns of rural elites, or about how their practices related to broader changes in material culture. Drawing on a large sample of bills and receipts of the Leigh family of Stoneleigh in Warwickshire, this article recreates the processes through which the material culture of the family home was constructed. These reveal London as the source for many high-quality goods, although the pattern of supply was not a simple dichotomy of local?everyday and metropolitan?luxury purchases. They also show the large number of shopkeepers patronized as the Leighs spread their purchases through choice, convenience, and expediency. Relating this to wider conceptions of consumption, the Leighs emerge as engaging in layered and sometimes conflicting consumer cultures. They were concerned with fashion as novelty and a marker of rank; but they also valued traditional markers of status.

TANG, JOHN P.;Large family-owned conglomerates known as zaibatsu have long been credited with leading Japanese industrialization during the Meiji period (1868?1912), despite a lack of empirical analysis. Using a new dataset collected from corporate genealogies to estimate entry probabilities, it is found that characteristics associated with zaibatsu increase a firm's likelihood of being an industry pioneer. In particular, first entry probabilities increase with industry diversification and private ownership, which may provide internal financing and risk-sharing, respectively. Nevertheless, the costs of excessive diversification may deter additional pioneering, which may account for the loss of zaibatsu technological leadership by the turn of the century.;2011;Technological leadership and late development: evidence from Meiji Japan, 1868–1912;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Taylor, Jason E.; Basu, Bharati; McLean, Steven";While economists predicted a return to double-digit unemployment rates during the reconversion from World War II, this outcome did not materialize. This article explores the role that the significant rise in net exports—which accounted for nearly 4 percent of GDP in 1946 and 1947—played in helping the United States avoid a postwar unemployment problem. Using an input-output analysis, we find that the export surplus directly accounted for 1.33 million jobs in 1946 and 1.97 million jobs in 1947. This accounts for close to half of the gains to private sector employment during these years.;2011;Net Exports and the Avoidance of High Unemployment During Reconversion, 1945–1947;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"TOOZE, ADAM; Ivanov, Martin";Using the example of Bulgaria, we argue that familiar models of international political economy fail to capture the tension between national sovereignty and access to capital markets experienced by peripheral debtors in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Existing accounts exaggerate the significance of the gold standard as a good housekeeping seal of approval and underestimate the role of direct financial controls. Furthermore, they underestimate the linkage in zones of inter-imperial rivalry, such as the Balkans, between foreign borrowing and strategic alignment. We show how Bulgaria found its politics destabilized prior to 1914 by the demands of its creditors. After defeat in the First World War, Bulgaria was forced to submit to an even tighter system of creditor control. Though it obtained substantial debt relief during the 1930s, these concessions were gained not through an assertion of national sovereignty and default, but at the price of even closer supervision. This in turn casts new light on the conventional view of Bulgaria as a victim of Nazi ?informal imperialism?. In light of Bulgaria's previous experience, the more striking feature of its trade relations with Hitler's Germany is that they were conducted on a basis of sovereign equality.;2011;Disciplining the ‘black sheep of the Balkans’: financial supervision and sovereignty in Bulgaria, 1902–38;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Uebele, Martin;This paper analyzes relative wheat price fluctuations to investigate market integration among 72 European and US cities. Applying a Dynamic Factor Model, which has seldom been used in market integration analysis, prices are decomposed into international, national and local components. Thus, national and international market integration are identified by a statistical restriction, and results for each single market are obtained. The first result is that globalization has accelerated faster in the first than in the second half of the 19th century, putting the post-1850 transport revolution into perspective. The USA integrated only later into the European market, discounting the role of the “grain invasion” for trade history. I also show that the European nations that turned protectionist after 1880 reduced the impact of foreign shocks, while free traders fully integrated into the international economy.;2011;National and international market integration in the 19th century: Evidence from comovement;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

van LOTTUM, JELLE;In most studies of early modern north-western Europe, England is regarded as the successor of the Netherlands in terms of economic leadership. Whereas related topics like institutional and technological change or changes in trade and capital flows have been incorporated into the research on the comparison of these two rival states, labour migration is usually omitted. This article aims to fill this lacuna by focusing on labour migration to the two core regions of the Netherlands and England: the Randstad and London. Two main research questions are raised in this article. First of all, in what way did the two cores and their hinterlands differ with regard to their demographic, economic, and spatial structures, and how did this contribute to different trends in labour migration over time? Secondly, what was the effect of the configuration of the demand and supply factors of London and the Randstad for their economies and for those who lived in them? By trying to answer these two questions this article aims not only to shed light on a hitherto largely unexplored topic in the comparative geographic, economic, and demographic history of the two countries, but also to contribute to the understanding of migration as a factor in the promotion of economic growth.;2011;Labour migration and economic performance: London and the Randstad, c. 1600–1800;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The new borders after 1918 are typically viewed as detrimental to the region's economic integration and development. We argue that this view lacks historical perspective. It fails to take into account that the new borders followed a pattern of economic fragmentation that had emerged during the late nineteenth century. We estimate the effects of the new borders on trade and find that the “treatment effects” of these borders were quite limited. There is strong evidence that border changes occurred systematically along barriers which existed already before 1914.;2011;On the Economic Consequences of the Peace: Trade and Borders After Versailles;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Zehetmayer, M.;This article explores whether the antebellum decline in heights continued in the second half of the nineteenth century by using a data set of more than 58,000 US Army recruits born between 1847 and 1894. The main finding is that heights continued to decline during the Civil War by about 0.4 in. (1.0 cm) and stagnated for an extended period of time before they began to increase among the birth cohorts of the late 1880s. Recruits from the South remained the tallest despite the Civil War, while those from the Northeast were the shortest.

We find no evidence of real macroeconomic effects from supply shocks to credit from commercial/savings banks in the periods 1922–1938 and 1981–2011 even though these periods contained several cases of severe banking crises. We attribute these findings to the special role played by bond-financed mortgage banks in the Danish financial system combined with comprehensive government interventions to safeguard financial stability during times of banking crises.;2012;Financial structures and the real effects of credit-supply shocks in Denmark 1922-2011;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
ACCOMINOTTI, OLIVIER;The Central European panic of the spring 1931 is often presented as a cause of the sterling crisis of September. But what was the transmission channel? This article explores how the continent's financial troubles affected Britain's banking system. The freeze of Central European assets created a liquidity strain for London merchant banks because they had accepted (guaranteed) the commercial bills of German merchants. I use new balance sheet data to quantify this shock and explore how the liquidity crisis contributed to the sterling crisis. The evidence demonstrates that international contagion was crucial in transmitting the 1931 global financial crisis.;2012;London Merchant Banks, the Central European Panic, and the Sterling Crisis of 1931;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"ACHESON, GRAEME G.; Turner, John D.; YE, QING";The seminal work of J. B. Jefferys highlighted two unusual features of the Victorian equity market, namely high share denomination and uncalled capital. This article examines the extent to which publicly traded company stocks in the nineteenth century had these features. It also analyses the effect of these features on stock returns using monthly data for the London Stock Market over the period 1825?70. We find that stocks with unpaid capital earned a higher return, which is consistent with investors being rewarded for the risk of a call on their personal assets. We also find that stocks with a high share denomination earned a lower return, which is consistent with the view that this feature was conducive to superior corporate governance.;2012;The character and denomination of shares in the Victorian equity market;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Adams, Michael; Andersson, Lars Fredrik; Lindmark, Magnus; Veprauskaite, Elena";Mutual and stock insurers have coexisted and competed against each other in insurance markets for centuries. In this article, we examine the risk management strategies and underwriting profitability of the different organizational forms in Sweden's property fire insurance market between 1903 and 1939. We demonstrate that stock insurers acted as intermediaries between policyholders and reinsurers to operate effectively in the potentially high-risk segments of the fire insurance market. In contrast, nationwide mutual insurers kept larger reserves to balance fluctuations in claims experiences, while local insurance pools relied on social obligation and trust to mobilize capital after adverse fire events.;2012;Competing Models of Organizational Form: Risk Management Strategies and Underwriting Profitability in the Swedish Fire Insurance Market Between 1903 and 1939;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Aldashev, Gani; Guirkinger, Catherine";We study the impact of a large-scale economic crisis on gender equality, using historical data from Kazakhstan in the late 19th–early 20th century. We focus on sex ratios (number of women per man) in Kazakh population between 1898 and 1908, in the midst of large-scale Russian in-migration into Kazakhstan that caused a sharp exogenous increase in land pressure. The resulting severe economic crisis made the nomadic organization of the Kazakh economy unsustainable and forced most Kazakh households into sedentary agriculture. Using a large novel dataset constructed from Russian colonial expedition materials, we document a low and worsening sex ratio (in particular, among poor households) between 1898 and 1908. The theoretical hypothesis that garners most support is that of excess female mortality in poorer households (especially among adults), driven by gender discrimination under the increasing pressure for scarce food resources.;2012;Deadly anchor: Gender bias under Russian colonization of Kazakhstan;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"ALFANI, GUIDO; GOURDON, VINCENT";The establishment of trust is a key component of economic activity and social ties can make business dealings work better. However, we do not know much about how economic actors created new social ties deliberately in order to pursue their objectives. This article analyses the way in which merchants and entrepreneurs used specific rituals to establish formal social ties, with the intent of protecting their business relationships. It focuses on relational instruments that until now had been neglected, particularly godparenthood and marriage witnessing. It shows that formalization, ritualization, and publicity of ties were used by entrepreneurs to establish trust with their business associates, for example when information was asymmetric or when institutions were perceived as inefficient in guaranteeing mutual good behaviour. The analysis covers a long period, from the late middle ages to today. It pays particular attention to the consequences of the Reformation in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and of the industrial revolution in the nineteenth. Contrary to the received wisdom, it suggests that formal social ties such as godparenthood continued to play an important role in economic activity during and after the industrial revolution. New databases on early modern Italy and nineteenth-century France are used.;2012;Entrepreneurs, formalization of social ties, and trustbuilding in Europe (fourteenth to twentieth centuries);The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Allen, Robert C.;The paper measures productivity growth in seventeen countries in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. GDP per worker and capital per worker in 1985 US dollars were estimated for 1820, 1850, 1880, 1913, and 1939 by using historical national accounts to back cast Penn World Table data for 1965 and 1990. Frontier and econometric production functions are used to measure neutral technical change and local technical change. The latter includes concurrent increases in capital per worker and output per worker beyond the highest values achieved. These increases were pioneered by the rich countries of the day. An increase in the capital-labor ratio was usually followed by a half century in which rich countries raised output per worker at that higher ratio. Then the rich countries moved on to a higher capital-ratio, and technical progress ceased at the lower ratio they abandoned. Most of the benefits of technical progress accrued to the rich countries that pioneered it. It is remarkable that countries in 1990 with low capital labor ratios achieved an output per worker that was no higher than countries with the same capital labor ratio in 1820. In the course of the last two hundred years, the rich countries created the production function of the world that defines the growth possibilities of poor countries today.;2012;Technology and the great divergence: Global economic development since 1820;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Annaert, Jan; BUELENS, FRANS; Ceuster, Marc J.K. de";The limited availability of high quality and computer readable data seriously impedes research in history and finance. We introduce a new monthly return series for Belgian owned equity based on Brussels Stock Market data for the period 1832–1914 as an improvement to the popular Drappier index. Over this period, our dataset includes 446,374 prices, 23,976 dividends, 371 stock and reverse splits (or other capital operations) on 2037 stocks of 1387 (foreign and Belgian) companies. Our dataset includes all shares and bonds but also high-quality information on prices, dividends, shares outstanding and market capitalization. In addition, company, country and sector information is available. We construct value weighted, price weighted and equally weighted indices as well as dividend yields. We find three important results. First, total nominal returns hover between 3.29% and 5.35% per annum, depending on how individual stocks are aggregated into the index. Second, dividend income constitutes the major part of total return and dividend distributions have a clear seasonal pattern. Third, the results highlight several drawbacks of the Drappier indices, especially an upward bias in expected equity performance.;2012;New Belgian Stock Market Returns: 1832–1914;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Arroyo Abad, Leticia; Davies, Elwyn; van Zanden, Jan Luiten";On the basis of a newly constructed dataset, this paper presents long-term series of the price levels, nominal wages, and real wages in Spanish Latin America – more specifically in Mexico, Peru, Bolivia, Colombia, Chile, and Argentina – between ca. 1530 and ca. 1820. It synthesizes the work of scholars who have collected and published data on individual cities and periods, and presents comparable indices of real wages and prices in the colonial period that give a reasonable guide to trends in the long run. We show that nominal wages and prices were on average much higher than in Western Europe or in Asia, a reflection of the low value of silver that must have had consequences for competitiveness of the Latin American economies. Labour scarcity was the second salient feature of Spanish Latin America and resulted in real wages much above subsistence and in some cases (Mexico, Bolivia, Argentina) comparable to levels in Northwestern Europe. For Mexico, this was caused by the dramatic decline of the population after the Conquest. For Bolivia, the driving force was the boom in silver mining in Potosi that created a huge demand for labour. In the case of Argentina, low population density was a pre-colonial feature. Perhaps due to a different pattern of depopulation, the real wages of other regions (Peru, Colombia and Chile) were much lower, and only increased above subsistence during the first half of the 18th century. These results are consistent with independent evidence on biological standards of living and with estimates of GDP per capita at the beginning of the 19th century.;2012;Between conquest and independence: Real wages and demographic change in Spanish America, 1530–1820;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"AUSTIN, GARETH; Baten, Jörg; van Leeuwen, Bas";West Africans are on average shorter than Europeans today. Whether this was already the case at the end of the Atlantic slave trade is an important question for the history of nutrition and physical welfare. We present the first study of changing heights for people born mostly in what are now northern Ghana and Burkina Faso during the early nineteenth century. The dataset, not used before for anthropometry, documents men born between 1800 and 1849. Mostly purchased from slave owners, they were recruited into the Dutch army to serve in the Dutch East Indies. We find that height development was stagnant between 1800 and 1830 and deteriorated strongly during the 1840s. In international comparison and after taking selectivity issues into account, these Ghanaian and Burkinabe recruits were notably shorter than north-western Europeans but not shorter than southern Europeans during this period.;2012;The biological standard of living in early nineteenth-century West Africa: new anthropometric evidence for northern Ghana and Burkina Faso;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Bajo-Rubio, Oscar;The balance of payments can act as a constraint on the rate of growth of output, since it puts a limit on the growth in the level of demand to which supply can adapt. In this paper, we examine this issue for the case of Spain, using time series data extending over the period 1850–2000. Overall, the external deficit does not seem to have worked as a constraint on the growth of the Spanish economy over the long run, unless some shorter and specific subperiods, such as 1940–1959 and 1959–1974. The Spanish economy seems to have used external deficits to smooth her level of aggregate consumption, which would be supported by the finding of sustainability of current account deficits along the period of analysis.;2012;The balance-of-payments constraint on economic growth in a long-term perspective: Spain, 1850–2000;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
BAKKER, GERBEN;Motion pictures constituted a revolutionary new technology that transformed entertainment—a rival, labor-intensive service—into a non-rival commodity. Combining growth accounting with a new output concept shows productivity growth in entertainment surpassed that in any manufacturing industry between 1900 and 1938. Productivity growth in personal services was not stagnant by definition, as current understanding has it, but instead was unparalleled in some cases. Motion pictures’ contribution to aggregate GDP and TFP growth was much smaller than that of general purpose technologies steam, railways, and electricity, but not insignificant. An observer might have noted that “motion pictures are everywhere except in the productivity statistics.”“So long as the number of persons who can be reached by a human voice is strictly limited, it is not very likely that any singer will make an advance on the £10,000 said to have been earned in a season by Mrs. Billington at the beginning of the last century, nearly as great as that which the business leaders of the present generation have made on the last.”Alfred Marshall;2012;How Motion Pictures Industrialized Entertainment;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Barnes, Geoffrey A.; Guinnane, Timothy W.";Simon Szreter's book Fertility, class and gender in Britain, 1860?1940 argues that social and economic class fails to explain the cross-sectional differences in marital fertility as reported in the 1911 census of England and Wales. Szreter's conclusion made the book immediately influential, and it remains so. This finding matters a great deal for debates about the causes of the European fertility decline of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. For decades scholars have argued whether the main forces at work were ideational or social and economic. This note reports a simple graphical and statistical re-analysis of Szreter's own data. We show that social class does explain cross-sectional differences in English marital fertility in 1911.;2012;Social class and the fertility transition: a critical comment on the statistical results reported in Simon Szreter's Fertility, class and gender in Britain, 1860–1940;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Barreca, Alan I.; Fishback, Price V.; Kantor, Shawn Everett";The Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) was associated with a population shift in the United States in the 1930s. Evaluating the relationship between the AAA and the incidence of malaria can therefore offer important lessons regarding the broader consequences of demographic changes. Using a quasi-first difference model and a robust set of controls, we find a negative association between AAA expenditures and malaria death rates at the county level. Further, we find that the AAA was associated with increased out-migration of low-income groups from counties with high-risk malaria ecologies. These results suggest that the AAA-induced migration played an important role in the reduction of malaria.;2012;Agricultural policy, migration, and malaria in the United States in the 1930s;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Becker, Sascha O.; Cinnirella, Francesco; Woessmann, Ludger";The interaction between investment in children’s education and parental fertility is crucial in recent theories of the transition from Malthusian stagnation to modern economic growth. This paper contributes to the literature on the child quantity–quality trade-off with new county-level evidence for Prussia in 1816, several decades before the demographic transition. We find a significant negative causal effect of education on fertility, which is robust to accounting for spatial autocorrelation. The causal effect of education is identified through exogenous variation in enrollment rates due to differences in landownership inequality. A comparison with estimates for 1849 suggests that the preference for quality relative to quantity might have increased during the first half of the nineteenth century.;2012;The effect of investment in children’s education on fertility in 1816 Prussia;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Beltrán Tapia, Francisco J.;The emergence of Spanish agricultural cooperatives from the end of the nineteenth century was a narrative of uneven regional development. It has been argued that the cooperative movement developed in areas where small and middle-sized farms were relatively important. This paper seeks to complement this explanation by analysing the role played by the pre-existing stock of social capital. The prior importance of institutions built around the use and management of collective resources is explored as an alternative proxy for social capital in pre-industrial economies. The results show that the social networks built around common lands and irrigation communities were a key element, together with relatively high levels of human capital and the existence of a wide layer of middle size farms, in facilitating the emergence of the cooperative movement in rural areas.;2012;Commons, social capital, and the emergence of agricultural cooperatives in early twentieth century Spain;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Bessen, James;How much of the rapid growth in output per man-hour in nineteenth-century cotton weaving arose from technical change and how much arose from price-driven substitution of capital for labor? Using an engineering production function, I find that factor price changes account for little of the growth in output per man-hour. However, much of the growth and most of the apparent labor-saving bias arose not from inventions, but from improved labor quality—better workers spent less time monitoring the looms. Labor quality played a critical role in the persistent association between economic growth and capital deepening in this important sector.;2012;More Machines, Better Machines…or Better Workers?;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

We analyze the same data and argue that parental choices were dictated by constraints rather than the desire to exploit child labor opportunities. We also find significant income effects on child labor supply, indicating that affluence played an important part in the decline of child labor. The coexistence of positive assets with child labor is not inconsistent with parental altruism, indicating instead a failure of perfect two-sided altruism.;2012;Parental altruism and child labor: examining the historical evidence from the United States;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Bignon, V.; Flandreau, Marc; UGOLINI, STEFANO";In this article we develop new tools to survey the development of lending-of-last-resort operations in the mid-nineteenth century. One finding is that free lending and extensive liquidity support against good collateral developed gradually after 1847, and was already a fact of life before Bagehot published Lombard Street. Another is that the extension of the Bank of England's lender-of-last-resort function went along with a reduction of its exposure to default risks, in contrast with accounts that have associated lending of last resort with moral hazard. Finally, we provide a new interpretation of the ?high rates? advocated by Bagehot. We suggest they were meant to prevent banks from free-riding on the safety offered by the central bank, and were aimed at forcing them to keep lending during crises so as to maintain a critical degree of liquidity in the money market.;2012;Bagehot for beginners: the making of lender-of-last-resort operations in the mid-nineteenth century;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Borowiecki, Karol Jan;In this paper, we explore whether, and to what extent, the incidence of war affects the migration intensity of 164 prominent classical composers born after 1800. We model the aggregate stock of composers in a country and find that periods of war correspond negatively with the number of artists. We also find that conflict-induced migration intensity is considerably higher for composers than for the overall population and demonstrate that the share of composers in the overall population drops due to the incidence of war. We further find that the observed outmigration substantially diminishes the country's creative potential in the long run.;2012;Are composers different?

Bugni, Federico A.;This paper explores the relationship between the state-specific child labor legislation and the decline in child labor that occurred in the US between 1880 and 1900. The existing literature that addresses this question uses a difference-in-difference estimation technique. We contribute to this literature in two ways. First, we argue that this estimation technique can produce misleading results due to (a) the possibility of multiplicity of equilibria and (b) the non-linearity of the underlying econometric model. Second, we develop an empirical strategy to identify the mechanism by which the legislation affected child labor decisions. In particular, besides establishing whether the legislation was effective or not, our analysis may determine whether the legislation constituted a benign policy or not, i.e., whether the legislation constrained the behavior of families (not benign) or whether it changed the labor market to a new equilibrium in which families voluntarily respected the law (benign).;2012;Child labor legislation: effective, benign, both, or neither?;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Burnette, Joyce;While child labour has always been an important part of the industrial revolution story, there is little quantitative evidence about the number of child workers in the 1740?1850 period. This article estimates trends in the percentage of the agricultural day-labouring workforce that were children. By using the wage level to identify child workers, it is possible to estimate child labour for a large sample of English farms. It is found that girls were rarely employed as day-labourers, while boys were employed about as frequently as women. The percentage of boys in the day-labour workforce increased until the 1820s and then declined.;2012;Child day-labourers in agriculture: evidence from farm accounts, 1740–1850;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
CAMPBELL, GARETH;The rationality of investors during asset price bubbles has been the subject of considerable debate. An analysis of the British Railway Mania, which occurred in the 1840s, suggests that investors may have been myopic, as their expectations were only accurate in the short-term, but they remained rational, as they acted in a utility maximising manner given their expectations. Investors successfully incorporated forecasts of short-term dividend changes into their valuations, but were unable to predict longer-term changes. When short-term growth is controlled for, it appears that the railways were priced consistently with the non-railways throughout the entire episode.;2012;Myopic rationality in a Mania;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Second, we review case fatality rates in other smallpox outbreaks, and discuss the likely incidence of the disease among Native Americans. Third, we analyse trade during the period of the epidemic. Fourth, we estimate the native population prior to the epidemic based on the carrying capacity of the region. All four approaches lead to a similar conclusion.

"Carmona, Juan; Rosés, Joan Ramón";To what extent were land markets the cause of Spanish agrarian backwardness? To address this unresolved issue, this paper uses new provincial data on average real land prices, together with a province-level variation in land productivity, to analyze the efficiency of land markets. Specifically, we test, first, whether land markets were spatially integrated and, secondly, whether land prices can be explained with the present value model. Our results suggest that land prices converged across provinces and that their variations were driven by market fundamentals. In consequence, we conclude that the institutional failure in land markets was not the cause of the relatively poor productivity performance of Spanish agriculture.;2012;Land markets and agrarian backwardness (Spain, 1904-1934);European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Carmona, Juan; Simpson, James";Recent literature on sharecropping has emphasized its importance in reducing problems associated with moral hazard in cultivation (in Tuscany), or providing a crucial ?rung? on the farm ladder (in the US south). Yet despite these and other important features, sharecropping was surprisingly absent in most regions. Using case studies associated with French wine production, this article argues that a number of factors have often been overlooked in the literature, the first of which is the need for landowners to be able to offer farms that were sufficiently large both to employ the sharecropper's family on a full-time basis, and to allow them to produce a variety of products to minimize risk. Second, measurement problems exist with the division of the harvest, especially when quality was an important factor in determining price. Finally, the nature of vertical cooperation and integration associated with the production and marketing arrangements of individual crops suggests that landowners were not indifferent to receiving payment in cash or kind, and this affected contract choice. This article incorporates these ideas to explain not just the presence and absence of sharecropping in different geographical localities, but also the wide variety of different forms of the contract that existed in France.;2012;Explaining contract choice: vertical coordination, sharecropping, and wine in Europe, 1850–1950;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Carson, Scott Alan;Little research exists on the body mass index values of late 19th- and early 20th-century African-Americans. Using a new BMI data set and robust statistics, this paper demonstrates that darker complexioned black BMIs were greater than for mulattos, and a mulatto BMI advantage did not exist. Throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, black BMIs decreased across the BMI distribution, indicating that the 20th-century increase in black BMIs did not have its origin in the 19th century. During industrialization, black BMIs were lower in Kentucky, Missouri, and urban Philadelphia. Late 19th- and early 20th-century black BMIs were related to occupations, and farmers had heavier BMIs than workers in other occupations.;2012;A quantile approach to the demographic, residential, and socioeconomic effects on 19th-century African-American body mass index values;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Chaudhary, Latika; Musacchio, Aldo; Nafziger, Steven; Yan, Se";Our paper provides a comparative perspective on the development of public primary education in four of the largest developing economies circa 1910: Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC). These four countries encompassed more than 50% of the world's population in 1910, but remarkably few of their citizens attended any school by the early 20th century. We present new, comparable data on school inputs and outputs for BRIC drawn from contemporary surveys and government documents. Recent studies emphasize the importance of political decentralization, and relatively broad political voice for the early spread of public primary education in developed economies. We identify the former and the lack of the latter to be important in the context of BRIC, but we also outline how other factors such as factor endowments, colonialism, serfdom, and, especially, the characteristics of the political and economic elite help explain the low achievement levels of these four countries and the incredible amount of heterogeneity within each of them.;2012;Big BRICs, weak foundations: The beginning of public elementary education in Brazil, Russia, India, and China;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Christodoulaki, Olga; Cho, Haeran; Fryzlewicz, Piotr";Time series of daily data for Greek sovereign risk have been compiled and analysed statistically to shed light on the way that historical events, including political and institutional changes, determined the creditworthiness of the Greek government on the London stock market from the start of the Great War until the Great Crash. No a priori important dates were specified. The Asia Minor campaign and its aftermath exerted a strongly negative impact on the value of Greek sovereign debt and as a result the risk premium increased rapidly. Statistical analysis shows that investors acted upon news of fiscal performance and public debt developments. Unforeseen political changes also influenced market participants' expectations. In contrast, institutional innovations such as the adoption of the gold exchange standard and the establishment of a central bank de novo did not result in any quantitative market response. However, stabilization and the concomitant institutional reforms were gradually factored into the market price of Greek sovereign debt traded in London and as a result the creditworthiness of the Greek government steadily improved.;2012;A reflection of history: fluctuations in Greek sovereign risk between 1914 and 1929;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The main hypothesis of this paper is that the radical policies implemented as part of the Great Leap Forward resulted in agricultural output decline (i.e., availability issues), and in the implementation of an ineffective food distribution policy affecting rural populations (i.e., accessibility issues). An econometric analysis, based on provincial panel data from the 1954–1966 period, stresses the effect of ill-advised economic policies in handling the famine. This analysis also confirms that the increase in mortality rates during the famine was caused by the simultaneous collapse in food availability and food accessibility in rural areas.;2012;Food availability, food entitlements, and radicalism during the Chinese great leap forward famine: an econometric panel data analysis;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
COHN, JR, SAMUEL;Over the past decade ?material culture? has become a sub-discipline of Italian Renaissance studies. This literature, however, has focused on the rich and their objects preserved in museums or reflected in paintings. In addition, the period 1300 to 1600 has been treated without attention to changes in the relationship between people and possessions. The article turns to last wills and testaments, which survive in great numbers and sink deep roots through late medieval and Renaissance cities and their hinterlands. They reveal aspirations and anxieties about things from post-mortem repairs to farm houses to pillows of monk's wool. These aspirations changed fundamentally after the Black Death. Earlier, during the ?commercial revolution?, ordinary merchants, artisans, and peasants on their deathbeds practised what the mendicants preached: stripping themselves of their possessions, they converted their estates to coin to be scattered among pious and non-pious beneficiaries. After the Black Death, testators began to reverse tack, devising ever more complex legal strategies to govern the future flow of their goods. This work of the dead had larger economic consequences. By encouraging the liquidation of estates, the earlier mendicant ideology quickened the velocity of exchange, while the early Renaissance attachment to things did the opposite.;2012;Renaissance attachment to things: material culture in last wills and testaments;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Crafts, Nicolas F. R.;This paper examines the role of competition in British productivity performance over the period from the late-nineteenth to the early twenty-first century. A detailed review of the evidence suggests that the weakness of competition from the 1930s to the 1970s undermined productivity growth but since the 1970s stronger competition has been a key ingredient in ending relative economic decline. The productivity implications of the retreat from competition resulted in large part from interactions with idiosyncratic British institutional structures in terms of corporate governance and industrial relations. This account extends familiar insights from cliometrics both analytically and chronologically.;2012;British relative economic decline revisited: The role of competition;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"CURTO-GRAU, MARTA; Herranz-Loncán, Alfonso; SOLÉ-OLLÉ, ALBERT";This article analyzes the effects of parliamentary representation on road infrastructure expenditure during the Spanish Restoration. Using a panel data set of Spanish provinces in 1880–1914, we find that the allocation of administrative resources among provinces depended both on the delegation characteristics (such as the share of MPs with party leadership positions, and their degree of electoral independence), and the regime's global search for stability. These results point to the importance of electoral dynamics within semi-democratic political systems, and offer an example of the influence of government tactics on infrastructure allocation.;2012;Pork-Barrel Politics in Semi-Democracies: The Spanish “Parliamentary Roads,” 1880–1914;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Cvrcek, Tomas;The early 20th century was a period of rising marriage rate and falling age at marriage. This was due to two factors affecting men. First, men's improving labor market prospects made them more attractive as marriage partners. Second, immigration had a dynamic effect on search costs. In the short-run, it fragmented the marriage market, making it harder to find a partner of one's preferred background. The high search costs led to less marriage and later marriage in the 1890s. In the long-run, as immigration declined, immigrants' descendants integrated with American society. This reduced search costs and increased the marriage rate.;2012;America's settling down: How better jobs and falling immigration led to a rise in marriage, 1880–1930;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
DEDINGER, BÉATRICE;When the Franco-German trade relationship is viewed from a long-term perspective, the conventional view that trade ties were rather good before 1914 becomes doubtful. In fact, trade statistics point to the absolute and relative decline in trade flows between the two countries after the Franco-Prussian war of 1870?1. This postwar episode of Franco-German trade history is far from incidental. On the basis of a comprehensive study of Franco-German trade by product, this article reveals a complete restructuring of French trade with Germany after the conflict and invites a new analysis of its economic consequences.;2012;The Franco-German trade puzzle: an analysis of the economic consequences of the Franco-Prussian war;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Di MARTINO, PAOLO;This article analyses the functioning of debt-discharge procedures in England and Wales in the light of the debate on entrepreneurial failure in the years between the late Victorian age and the interwar period. Using an original dataset and an empirical approach, it is argued that social norms, cultural elements, and class considerations influenced the outcome of decisions in a way that could have reduced the incentives for economic agents to engage with productive activity. Results show that over the entire period judges paid disproportionate attention to moral issues, and often gave lighter sentences to members of the elite who went into bankruptcy for personal reasons, and tougher ones to entrepreneurs who failed because of engagement with economic activity.;2012;Legal institutions, social norms, and entrepreneurship in Britain (c.1890–c.1939);The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Di Vaio, Gianfranco; Waldenström, Daniel; Weisdorf, Jacob L.";This study examines the determinants of citation success among authors who have recently published their work in economic history journals. Besides offering clues about how to improve one's scientific impact, our citation analysis also sheds light on the state of the field of economic history. Consistent with our expectations, we find that full professors, authors appointed at economics and history departments, and authors working in Anglo-Saxon and German countries are more likely to receive citations than other scholars. Long and co-authored articles are also a factor for citation success. We find similar patterns when assessing the same authors' citation success in economics journals. As a novel feature, we demonstrate that the diffusion of research — publication of working papers, as well as conference and workshop presentations — has a first-order positive impact on the citation rate.;2012;Citation success: Evidence from economic history journal publications;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

An innovative methodology, with special attention being paid to changes in residual dispersion of the univariate models of relative prices between markets, permits us to obtain a measure of market integration over time.;2012;The Integration of Grain Markets in the Eighteenth Century: Early Rise of Globalization in the West;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Dostie, Benoit; Dupré, Ruth";The 1920s American alcohol prohibition is notorious but not unique. Quite a few countries went through a vigorous struggle. But it is in Canada in 1898 that the very first national referendum on prohibition in the world took place. In this article, we focus on this rare and neglected event in Canadian history, in which the government came close but finally did not impose prohibition. In our empirical analysis, we use census district-level data to investigate how the shares of Yes, No and Abstentions vary according to four sets of factors: religious, demographic, social and economic. Our results confirm the literature on temperance and prohibition with religion [Evangelicals against Catholics and Anglicans] as the key explanatory variable, followed by the heterogeneity of the population, measured by the proportion of foreign-born. Urbanization has also the expected (although small) impact. Results for wealth are mixed. The economic interest rationale is not confirmed but that can be explained by the historical context.;2012;“The people's will”: Canadians and the 1898 referendum on alcohol prohibition;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Dribe, M.; Olsson, Mats; Svensson, Patrick";In much of preindustrial Europe, the manorial estate was an important institution in the rural economy. Despite a widespread view that the estates insured its tenants against uncertainties, there is little evidence that measures taken were efficient. This study uses the impact of grain prices on demographic outcomes as a measure of the efficiency of the manorial system in protecting its inhabitants against economic stress. Looking at four hundred parishes in southern Sweden (1749–1859), the manorial estate seems to have been able to insure its inhabitants against risks of economic stress, but the protective effect was highly imperfect, and only short term.;2012;Was the manorial system an efficient insurance institution?

"Dribe, Martin; Olsson, Mats; Svensson, Patrick";The manorial system was a salient feature of the pre-industrial economy in Europe from the early middle ages until the late nineteenth century. Despite its importance, it is not usually the main focus of eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century European economic history. Looking at a vital manorial economy, this article deals with land transmissions, a crucial factor in the socioeconomic reproduction of pre-industrial societies, and demonstrates both similarities and important differences between the tenants on manorial land and freeholders. Although their strategies were often similar, we show that the manorial system consisted of a two-party government?the landlord and the tenant?whose interests did not always coincide. In the nineteenth century, market expansion and commercialization promoted more active landlord strategies in terms of demesne expansions and by means of implementing short-term leases. This made intergenerational transfers within the family increasingly difficult for tenants.;2012;If the landlord so wanted . . .

"Dribe, Martin; van de PUTTE, BART";In this article we study the evolution of marriage seasonality in relation to economic change, particularly connected to changes in labour supply and work intensity of the kind implied by the ?industrious revolution?. The focus is on southern Sweden in 1685?1894, which was a period of agricultural transformation and early industrialization, when we would expect to see an increase in work intensity. The analysis is based on about 120,000 marriages from 117 different parishes. The analysis shows that the seasonality of marriage changed dramatically over time, from a classic grain production pattern, with a marriage peak in late spring and a marriage trough at harvest time, to a much more even seasonality, although with the appearance of a very strong peak in December. This change affected rural rather than urban areas, and was present regardless of differences in institutional settings, and for almost all occupational groups below the elite. The changed seasonality pattern is consistent with increasing work intensity over the year, leaving only the weeks around Christmas as a low season. In addition to the increase in work intensity, the privatization of marriage and the availability of time and resources were also important factors in the changing seasonality pattern.;2012;Marriage seasonality and the industrious revolution: southern Sweden, 1690–1895;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Although a few writers have tried to characterize the rise in travel, their descriptions are almost exclusively narrative with colourful opinions and very little quantitative evidence. This is our attempt to fill in the gap. We have linked together several series on overseas travel in order to produce a consistent long-term series covering the period 1820 to 2000, and have also constructed a new time series on passenger fares for much of the period in which ocean travel was the means of going abroad. We use these new data, along with other evidence on GDP per capita, air fares, exchange rates, and indexes of technological change in the travel industry, in an attempt to explain the long-term rise in overseas travel.;2012;The long-term rise in overseas travel by Americans, 1820–2000;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Edvinsson, Rodney Benjamin;In 1624–1776, Sweden implemented a complicated trimetallic monetary system. Five different copper, silver, and gold currencies circulated. The heaviest copper coins weighed 20 kg. Gresham's law worked differently for various coins. Swedish trimetallism was asymmetric. Copper money could not replace silver and gold coins. When the latter became undervalued they circulated at a premium. Due to high transaction costs in using copper coins at a premium, they were sometimes driven out when becoming dear money. However, complaints about money shortage and Sweden's monopoly position at the European copper markets implied that the copper standard was not abandoned until 1777.;2012;Early modern copper money: multiple currencies and trimetallism in Sweden 1624–1776;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Edvinsson, Rodney Benjamin;In 1624–1776 Sweden minted intrinsic value copper coins, alongside silver coins. One purpose behind introducing the copper standard was to use its monopoly position at the European markets to manipulate the international copper prices, implementing a kind of copper mercantilism. This paper presents a model of an early modern copper monopolist that could price discriminate between two different uses for copper: copper for export and copper for minting. The paper concludes that authorities did not completely conform to this rent-seeking model, since there were also other considerations behind minting policy, such as providing a stable monetary system. The model shows that under profit-maximisation minting should have been even higher and the price of copper money lower, but at periods minting and prices approached the optimal state. In the 17th century, the market for copper money was probably too small relative the huge copper production, but by the 1720s and 1730s, when copper production had declined, the copper standard functioned more smoothly.;2012;The international political economy of early modern copper mercantilism: Rent seeking and copper money in Sweden 1624–1776;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"EDWARDS, JEREMY; OGILVIE, SHEILAGH";Social scientists draw important lessons for modern development from the medieval Maghribi traders who, it has been argued, lacked effective legal mechanisms for contract enforcement and instead relied on informal sanctions based on collective ostracism within an exclusive coalition. We show that this claim is untenable. Not a single empirical example adduced as evidence of the putative coalition shows that a coalition actually existed. The Maghribi traders made use of the formal legal system in order to enforce agency agreements in long-distance trade. A subset of the traders did form a web of trusted business associates that contributed to informal contract enforcement, but this was very different from the hypothesized coalition, in neither being exclusive nor having a clearly defined membership. The Maghribi traders combined reputation-based sanctions with legal mechanisms, in ways that resemble the practices of medieval European merchants. We find no evidence that the Maghribi traders had more ?collectivist? cultural beliefs than their European counterparts.;2012;Contract enforcement, institutions, and social capital: the Maghribi traders reappraised;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

This paper re-examines the causes of the outstanding success of the Champagne fairs in mediating international trade, the timing and causes of the fairs' decline, and the institutions for securing property rights and enforcing contracts at the fairs. It finds that contract enforcement at the fairs did not take the form of private-order or corporative mechanisms, but was provided by public institutions. More generally, the success and decline of the Champagne fairs depended on the policies adopted by the public authorities — for good or ill.;2012;What lessons for economic development can we draw from the Champagne fairs?;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Building on work in cognitive science and literature on foreign policy making, this article seeks to account for the influence of this particular historical analogy and asks how it shaped both perceptions and the economic policy response. It asks how historical scholarship might be better organized to inform the process of economic policymaking.

Elliot, Rosemary;In the postwar period, the West German tobacco industry faced several challenges, not least competition from smuggled Virginia cigarettes. This reflected the Americanization of smoking tastes and threatened domestic tax revenue. The popular preference for ?American blend? cigarettes also hindered trade with Greece and Turkey, suppliers of Oriental tobacco to German manufacturers. The proposed solution was tax cuts to stimulate demand for domestically produced cigarettes. These proposals antagonized welfare groups, who saw tax cuts as a threat to the health of the population. The ensuing debates and settlement shed new light on the liberal smoking policies of postwar West Germany.;2012;Smoking for taxes: the triumph of fiscal policy over health in postwar West Germany, 1945–55;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The results also underline the role as determinants of pension policy of both domestic and external factors. In line with previous literature, income per capita and the share of old people are key drivers of pensions.

Espuelas, Sergio;Using new data on Spain and Portugal 1950–1980, this paper shows that non-democratic governments were less generous in providing social protection and also financed their meager social policy in a less redistributive way.

The analysis also reveals that, rather than provoking a “race to the bottom” or an increase in social spending, globalization favored the adoption of tax-funded systems instead of systems based on compulsory social security contributions.;2012;Are dictatorships less redistributive?

Faith, Rosamond;Peasant producers are now recognized as having played an important part in the late medieval economy: this can also be said of peasant producers in eastern England before the Conquest. In the wake of the Viking invasions Scandinavian settlers from the second half of the ninth century entered a region that was already commercially active. Independent farmers raised sheep, possibly a newly introduced breed, on the Lincolnshire Wolds and marketed their wool. A network of Anglo-Scandinavian shippers and traders, members of a merchant elite, controlled important places on river routes. That Lincolnshire was an area of light manorialization and many sokemen had an invigorating effect on its economy. Peasant producers had comparative freedom and by controlling markets and extracting cash from the inhabitants of their sokes Anglo-Norman lords profited from an economy that had been invigorated by Scandinavian enterprise.;2012;The structure of the market for wool in early medieval Lincolnshire;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Federico, Giovanni;The literature on commodity market integration has boomed in the last 15 years, and a sort of consensus is slowly emerging, at least with regard to trends in the last two centuries. This article argues that this consensus is fragile because the research is haunted by serious methodological shortcomings. The results are not really comparable because authors use a bewildering array of statistical techniques, without bothering too much about their assumptions and, more generally, about the theoretical foundations of their work. Market integration is a multi-faceted process and available techniques can be classified according to the issues they are suitable to tackle. In other words, the methodological choices, together with the available data, have steered the research towards a quite narrow set of issues. Thus we know much less than we suppose. The final section sketches out a research agenda beyond pure measurement.;2012;How much do we know about market integration in Europe?;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Federico, Giovanni;Duties on wheat were the mainstay of trade policy in Europe in the first half of the nineteenth century. This paper documents the changes in policy of seven wheat-importing countries of Western Europe and interprets them with a political support model. All these countries raised duties after the end of French wars to protect the dominating landed interests against falling world prices. Prices started to rise in the late 1820s and this rise accounted for long-run liberalization. Price movements may also explain the timing of some decisions, but many others depended on circumstances and on the wider political machinations.;2012;The Corn Laws in continental perspective;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
FELICE, EMANUELE;The article aims to present and discuss estimates of levels of human and social capital in Italy’s regions over the long term, i.e., roughly from the second half of the nineteenth century up to the present day. The results are linked to newly available evidence for regional value added in order to begin to form an explanatory hypothesis of long-term regional inequality in Italy: convergence in value added per capita is tested in light of the neoclassical exogenous growth approach, which incorporates human capital and social capital as conditioning variables into a long-term production function. In contrast with conventional wisdom (e.g. Putnam 1993), we find that social capital was not a significant predictor of economic growth in post-Unification Italy: It grew in importance only in the last decades. Conversely, human capital was more important in the first half of the twentieth century. Results suggest that there was not one single conditioning variable over the long run, thus supporting the view that, in different periods, conditioning variables can be determined by technological regimes.;2012;Regional convergence in Italy, 1891–2001: testing human and social capital;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"FELICE, EMANUELE; CARRERAS, ALBERT";The article reconsiders the growth of Italian industry from the First World War to the eve of the economic miracle, with the aid of sector-specific new value-added series, at three different price-bases. The new estimates reduce growth during the First World War, making the Italian case comparable to the other belligerent countries, while improving the performance of the 1920s. The 1929 crisis looks more profound than before, but the recovery after 1933 is now stronger. During the 1920s and the 1930s, a significant shift from traditional to more advanced activities took place, and the cycles of consumption related industries grew in importance: after linking the available estimates with those produced by Fenoaltea for liberal Italy, both descriptive statistics and cointegration analysis suggest that some of these movements began with the turn of the previous century, a finding in line with institutional interpretations of Italy's economic growth. When confronted with the rest of Europe, in industrial production Italy's first half of the twentieth century was a relative success, which laid the ground for the following economic boom.;2012;When did modernization begin?

FENSKE, JAMES;The ?land abundance? view of African history uses sparse population to explain economic institutions. This article uses colonial court records to show that the Egba of Nigeria fit this theory's predictions. Before 1914, the Egba had imprecisely defined land rights, relied on dependent and forced labour, and used labour to secure loans. These institutions responded to the changing availability of land, labour, and capital. An initial period of land scarcity altered land ownership. A market existed for the most valuable land. Slaves were used by those with better opportunities to acquire them, and credit expanded after the introduction of tree crops.;2012;Land abundance and economic institutions: Egba land and slavery, 1830–1914;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"FERGUSON, NIALL; Schularick, Moritz";We ask whether developing countries reap credibility gains from submitting policy to a strict monetary rule. We look at the gold standard era, 1880–1914, to test whether adoption of a rule-based monetary framework such as the gold standard increased policy credibility, focusing on sixty independent and colonial borrowers in the London market. We challenge the traditional view that gold standard adherence was a credible commitment mechanism rewarded by financial markets with lower borrowing costs. We demonstrate that for the poor periphery—where policy credibility is a particularly acute problem—the market looked behind “the thin film of gold”.;2012;"The ""Thin film of gold"": monetary rules and policy credibility";European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Flandreau, Marc; Flores Zendejas, Juan H.";This paper offers a theory of conditionality lending in nineteenth-century international capital markets. We argue that ownership of reputation signals by prestigious banks rendered them able and willing to monitor government borrowing. Monitoring was a source of rent, and it led bankers to support countries facing liquidity crises in a manner similar to modern descriptions of “relationship” lending to corporate clients by “parent” banks. Prestigious bankers' ability to implement conditionality loans and monitor countries' financial policies also enabled them to deal with solvency.  We find that, compared with prestigious bankers, bondholders' committees had neither the tools nor the prestige required for effectively dealing with defaulters. Hence such committees were far less important than previous research has claimed.;2012;Bondholders versus bond-sellers?

"Foreman-Peck, James; Hannah, Leslie";We present the first broadly representative study for any early twentieth-century economy of the extent to which quoted company ownership was already divorced from managerial control. In the 337 largest, independent, UK companies in the Investor's year book (those with £1 million or more quoted share capital in 1911), the generality of public shareholders were a narrower group than today, but directors personally owned only 3.4 per cent of the shares. This indicates a lower level of personal ownership (and board voting control) in the largest securities market of the early twentieth century than in any of the world's major securities markets toward the end of that century. Berle, Means, Gordon, and others subsequently quantified the US's later and (on this dimension) less advanced managerial ?revolution?. Their evidence was widely misinterpreted: some erroneously concluded that the US pioneered this aspect of ?modernity? and that the ?divorce? of ownership from control, globally, was a new and continuing trend.;2012;Extreme divorce: the managerial revolution in UK companies before 1914;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Frankema, Ewout H.P.;British colonial rule has often been praised for its comparatively benign features, such as its support of local educational development. This study argues that the impact of British educational policies and investments on the supply of schooling in British Africa should not be overstated. Until 1940, mission schools, mainly run by African converts, provided the bulk of education at extremely low costs. Given the limited financial capacity of missionary societies, the Africanization of the mission was a prerequisite for rising enrolment rates and this only occurred in areas where the demand for Western education was high. The British happened to control most of these “fertile” areas.;2012;The origins of formal education in sub-Saharan Africa: was British rule more benign?;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

We push African income estimates back in time by presenting urban unskilled real wages for nine British African colonies (1880–1965). We find that African real wages were well above subsistence level and that they rose significantly over time.

We study this decline using a new panel data set on the remuneration of top executives in 246 firms. Government regulation—including explicit salary restrictions and taxation—had, at best, a modest effect on executive pay. By contrast, a decline in the returns to firm size and an increase in the power of labor unions contributed greatly to the reduction in executive compensation relative to other workers’ earnings from 1940 to 1946. The continued decrease in relative executive pay remains largely unexplained.;2012;Pay Cuts for the Boss: Executive Compensation in the 1940s;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
FUSARO, MARIA;This article outlines the commercial and financial activities of commercial networks active in the ?Venetian? eastern Mediterranean between the loss of Cyprus (1571) and the onset of the War of Candia (1645). The goal of the article is to present the results of recent research on early modern Mediterranean trade and finance, drawing attention to some promising areas of investigation that have been overlooked by scholarship and that constitute part of the author's own work in progress. The central question is: how did traditional Mediterranean networks and trade fare in the age of global expansion? In other words, did Mediterranean trade networks experience an evolution in their structures similar to the rest of the world? An attempt is made to answer this question through an analysis of the activities of Greek, Venetian, and English mercantile and financial networks in the eastern Mediterranean, showing the peculiarities of the interplay between trade and finance that underpinned the economy of the Venetian Stato da Mar. This attempt highlights two phenomena at play within the ?Venetian Mediterranean?: firstly, that foreign operators began directly financing Venetian imperial administrative structures, and secondly, that the number of Venetian merchants involved in these operations increased as new players entered the financial game.;2012;Cooperating mercantile networks in the early modern Mediterranean;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Securities in the 25th percentile of the liquidity distribution earned, on average, a 0.59 percent higher monthly return than securities in the 75th percentile. This effect is comparable with estimates from modern stock markets and suggests that the liquidity premium is not solely a modern phenomenon but could be an inherent characteristic of financial markets.;2012;Liquidity premia during the industrial breakthrough: evidence from the Stockholm Stock Exchange, 1901-1919;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"GRAFE, REGINA; IRIGOIN, MARIA ALEJANDRA";This article revises the traditional view of Spain as a predatory colonial state that extracted revenue from natural resources and populations in the Americas while offering little in return. Using eighteenth-century Spanish American treasury accounts, we show that local elites exerted important control not only over revenue collection, as previously argued by the authors, but also over expenditure allocation. The Spanish colonial state developed into a stakeholder model, in which local interests were deeply invested in the survival and expansion of empire. The means of co-optation were intra-colonial transfers, as well as credit relations between the state and colonial individuals and corporations, which guaranteed that much of colonial revenue was immediately fed back into the local economy, while minimizing enforcements costs. By allowing stakeholder control of both revenue and expenditure, Spain managed to avoid the problems faced by France, where royal control of expenditure clashed with partial elite control of revenue-raising.;2012;A stakeholder empire: the political economy of Spanish imperial rule in America;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Gregg, Matthew T.; Wishart, David M.";In this paper, we estimate the social costs and income transfers of Cherokee removal, i.e., “The Trail of Tears.” Our cost estimates provide several new insights into this extensively studied topic. First, our estimate of the number of removal-related fatalities is considerably lower than the commonly accepted figure of 4000. Second, the uncompensated value of ceded Cherokee land in the southeast was the largest cost borne by the Cherokees, followed in magnitude by the value of lost agricultural output due to removal. Third, American taxpayers paid for roughly 44% of the total social costs of removal. Also, the cost burden of Cherokee removal, as a share of 1year's GDP, was greater for the Cherokees than the cost burden of any major war for the American population.;2012;The price of Cherokee removal;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
GREIF, AVNER;Previous studies concluded that a private-order institution based on a multilateral reputation mechanism was particularly important in governing agency relations among the Maghribi traders who operated in the Muslim Mediterranean. The legal system and a bilateral reputation mechanism were particularly important among the Genoese traders. Initial cultural, social, and political factors led to this institutional distinction, while the incorporation of culture in the resulting institutions influenced subsequent institutional developments. In particular, the particularities of the late medieval European institutions contributed to the rise of the modern?impersonal?markets in Europe. The analysis also substantiates the contention that private-order institutions can support sophisticated exchange and market-promoting policies should take this into account, particularly in countries lacking an effective court system. An article by Edwards and Ogilvie challenges this analysis. It alleges that the Maghribis, like European traders, relied on court enforcement and a bilateral reputation mechanism in which a narrow social circle responded to opportunism. This article shows that Edwards and Ogilvie's analysis and conclusions are wrong. It refutes each of their empirical claims and presents additional pieces of evidence supporting the institutional distinction conjecture. The discussion is structured around the methodological challenge associated with comparative and historical institutional analysis.;2012;The Maghribi traders: a reappraisal?;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Despite its importance, however, the difficulty of calculating the ?invisible earnings? from the shipping industry's engagement in international activities has led to its underestimation in most analyses of the country's economic growth.

Harley, C. Knick;Price and profit data between the 1770s and the 1820s from accounting records of three Lancashire cotton firms help to illumine the nature of the economic processes at work in early industrialization. Many historians have seen the Industrial Revolution as a Schumpeterian process in which discontinuous technological change led by the mechanized factories of the cotton industry created large profits for innovators that persisted in succeeding decades while technology slowly diffused. In this view imperfect capital markets limited the use of the new technology, keeping profits high. Reinvestment of these profits gradually financed expansion of innovating firms. The new technology dominated only after a long diffusion process. The evidence here, however, supports a more equilibrium view in which the industry expanded rapidly and prices fell in response to technological change. Expansion of the industry led to dramatic declines in the prices of cotton goods as early as the 1780s. There is no evidence of super-normal profits thereafter. Prices continued to fall and output expand thereafter as cost-reducing technological change continued.;2012;Was technological change in the early Industrial Revolution Schumpeterian?

"HARRIS, BERNARD; Gorsky, Martin; GUNTUPALLI, ARAVINDA MEERA; HINDE, ANDREW";This article presents new evidence on long-term trends in sickness rates in England and Wales using data from the Hampshire Friendly Society. In previous work, Edwards, Gorsky, Harris, and Hinde argued that this Society contained a uniquely detailed set of records for the study of individual sickness histories. However, their initial findings were based on the records of a relatively small number of men who joined the Society at different points in time between 1871 and 1912. The current article draws on a much larger body of evidence, based on the records of over 5,500 men who joined between 1824 and 1939. It examines trends in the seasonality of sickness episodes, changes in the relationship between sickness and age, and cause-specific sickness rates. The results indicate that there was little change in age-specific morbidity rates over time, but morbidity did increase with age, mainly because older men remained off work for longer, even when they succumbed to the same conditions as men in younger age groups.;2012;Long-term changes in sickness and health: further evidence from the Hampshire Friendly Society;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Harrison, Mark; WOLF, NIKOLAUS";Wars are increasingly frequent, and the trend has been steadily upward since 1870. The main tradition of western political and philosophical thought suggests that extensive economic globalization and democratization over this period should have reduced appetites for war far below their current level. This view is clearly incomplete: at best, confounding factors are at work. Here, we explore the capacity to wage war. Most fundamentally, the growing number of sovereign states has been closely associated with the spread of democracy and increasing commercial openness, as well as the number of bilateral conflicts. Trade and democracy are traditionally thought of as goods, both in themselves, and because they reduce the willingness to go to war, given the national capacity to do so, but the same factors may also have been increasing the capacity for war, and thus its frequency.;2012;The frequency of wars;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Haupert, Michael; Murray, James";Over the course of the twentieth century, American wages increased by a factor of about 100, while the wages of professional baseball players increased by a factor of 450, but that increase was neither smooth nor consistent. We use a unique and expansive dataset of salaries and performance variables of Major League Baseball pitchers that spans over 400 players and 60 years during the reserve clause era to identify factors that determine salaries and examine how the importance of various factors have changed over time. We employ a Markov regime-switching regression model borrowed from the macroeconomics literature, which allows regression coefficients to switch exogenously between two or more values as time progresses. This method lets us identify changes in wage determination that may have occurred because of a change in the league’s competitiveness, a change in the relative bargaining power between players and teams, or other factors that may be unknown or unobservable. We find that even though Major League Baseball was a tightly controlled monopsony with the reserve clause, there was a significant shift in salary determination that lasted from the Great Depression until after World War II where players’ salaries were more highly linked to their recent performance.;2012;Regime switching and wages in major league baseball under the reserve clause;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Hautcoeur, Pierre-Cyrille; Riva, Angelo";This article sets out to explain why the Paris Bourse was highly successful in the nineteenth century in spite of the supposedly inefficient monopoly of the official market, the Parquet. The literature argues that the official monopoly was sidelined by a free, innovative market known as the Coulisse, but it fails to explain how the Coulisse emerged despite the monopoly and how the two markets persisted alongside each other during the entire century. We provide a detailed history of how these two markets emerged and interacted. The Parquet increasingly developed as a high-end market, providing security, transparency, and effective settlement-delivery to unsophisticated investors trading on the spot market. The Coulisse provided liquidity, immediacy, and opacity to professional investors trading mostly forward. In line with recent theoretical developments, we argue that the juxtaposition of heterogeneous organizations had important virtues for market participants, since it allowed the exchanges to specialize in different investors and services and made the exchanges complementary to each other. We demonstrate our claim by looking at both the formal rules and the actual functioning of the Parquet, drawing on its archives which we have recently classified.;2012;The Paris financial market in the nineteenth century: complementarities and competition in microstructures;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"HENRIKSEN, INGRID; HVIID, MORTEN; Sharp, Paul Richard";We consider the successful early emergence of cooperative creameries in Denmark in the late nineteenth century within the framework of the “new institutional economics” presented by Oliver Williamson. Previous work focused on the social cohesion of the Danes, but we demonstrate that this was not sufficient for their success. The Danish legal system, which we compare to that of other countries, was also of crucial importance, along with the way in which rules were monitored and enforced. Of particular interest is the Danish cooperatives’ use of contracts, which we explore with evidence from a variety of primary and secondary sources.;2012;Law and Peace: Contracts and the Success of the Danish Dairy Cooperatives;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"HENRIKSEN, INGRID; Lampe, Markus; Sharp, Paul Richard";The usual story of the ?first era of globalization? at the end of the nineteenth century sees Denmark as something of an outlier: a country which, like the UK, resisted the globalization backlash in the wake of the inflow of cheap grain from the New World, but where agriculture, rather than going into decline, in fact flourished. Key to the success of Danish agriculture was an early diversification towards dairy production. This article challenges this simple story which sees Denmark as something of a liberal paragon. Denmark's success owed much to a prudent use of trade policy which favoured dairy production. Moreover, this favouritism continued even after a more general movement to free trade in the 1860s. Using micro-level data from individual dairies, we quantify the implied subsidy to dairy production from the tariffs, and demonstrate that in many cases this ensured the profitability of individual dairies.;2012;The strange birth of liberal Denmark: Danish trade protection and the growth of the dairy industry since the mid-nineteenth century;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The results indicate that although corporate stock was held principally by the city's elite merchants in both periods, share ownership became more widespread over time among less affluent households. In particular, later corporations were owned and managed by investors who were less wealthy than the stockholders of corporations created in earlier, less democratic periods.;2012;Democratic Dividends: Stockholding, Wealth, and Politics in New York, 1791–1826;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
HIPKIN, STEPHEN;Exploiting hitherto unexamined London port book data, this article shows that during the last quarter of the seventeenth century the coastal metropolitan corn import trade was twice the size that historians relying on the work of Gras have assumed it to have been. More significantly, it demonstrates that Gras's failure to examine the capital's grain trade other than in terms of aggregate corn imports has disguised the nature and extent of its contribution to the development of the London economy. By the 1680s, the coastal trade comprised two distinct strands of roughly equal size: one providing food and drink for the London population, the other fuelling the overland trade of the capital. It is argued that the former was unnecessary for the provision of the city other than in barren years, but that the latter may have been indispensable for the development of the overland transport infrastructure of the metropolitan region at the height of the late seventeenth-century commercial revolution. Thanks largely to the agency of southern English mariners commanding large coasters, London's demand for fodder crops after the mid-1670s drew most of the coast stretching from Berwick to Whitehaven into the orbit of the metropolitan corn market.;2012;The coastal metropolitan corn trade in later seventeenth-century England;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
HOFFMAN, PHILIP T.;By the 1700s Europeans dominated the gunpowder technology, which was surprising, because it had originated in China and been used with expertise throughout Eurasia. To account for their dominance, historians have invoked competition, but it cannot explain why they pushed this technology further than anyone else. The answer lies with a simple tournament model of military competition that allows for learning by doing. Political incentives and military conditions then explain why the rest of Eurasia fell behind Europeans in developing the gunpowder technology. The consequences were huge, from colonialism to the slave trade and even the Industrial Revolution.;2012;Why Was It Europeans Who Conquered the World?;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Horrell, Sara; Oxley, Deborah";"The impact of changing diet and resultant nutrition on living standards over the industrial revolution has been much debated, yet existing data have enabled only general trends to be identified. We use data from Eden's survey of parishes in 1795 and the Rural Queries of 1834 to go beyond average calorie intake, instead focusing on micronutrients and quality of diet. From this we discern regional differences in diet. In 1795 these differences were related to the availability of common land and the nature of women's work. Diet in both periods also maps onto stature. Using five datasets on height, we observe a positive impact of diet in 1795 on men's, women's, and boy's heights. By 1834 the impact is less evident; for men it remained, for women and boys it either no longer existed or became negative. This may indicate the superseding of nutritional factors by environmental ones, but it also hints at the emergence of a different relationship between height and nutrition for women and children compared with men. We speculate that this points to a shift in the intra-household allocation of resources, but challenge the notion that the emergence of male breadwinning automatically led to universal female disadvantage.";2012;Bringing home the bacon?

There was dramatic disintegration during World War I, gradual reintegration during the 1920s, and then a substantial disintegration after 1929. The period saw the unravelling of many of the integration gains of 1870–1913. While increased transport costs help explain the wartime disintegration, they cannot explain the post-1929 increase in trade costs. The proliferation of tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade, the collapse of the interwar gold standard, and the evaporation of commercial credit loom large as suspects.;2012;Commodity market disintegration in the interwar period;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

This evidence and a controlled comparison with northern US firms demonstrate that industrial development could be successful under surprisingly diverse conditions, as long as these conditions did not impede the exploitation of scale economies, technical efficiency, or technological choice.;2012;Diverse paths to industrial development: evidence from late-nineteenth-century Canada;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
KARABABA, EMINEGÜL;This study investigates the development of early modern Ottoman consumer culture. In particular, the democratization of consumption, which is a significant indicator of the development of western consumer cultures, is examined in relation to Ottoman society. Sixteenth- and seventeenth-century probate inventories of the town of Bursa combined with literary and official sources are used in order to identify democratization of consumption and the macro conditions shaping this development. Findings demonstrate that commercialization, international trade, urbanization which created a fluid social structure, and the ability of the state to negotiate with guilds were possible contextual specificities which encouraged the democratization of consumption in the Bursa context.;2012;Investigating early modern Ottoman consumer culture in the light of Bursa probate inventories;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Kelly, Morgan; Ó Gráda, Cormac";England's post-Reformation demographic regime has been characterized as “low pressure.” Yet the evidence hitherto for the presence of a preventive check, defined as the short-run response of marriage and births to variations in living standards, is rather weak. New evidence in this article strengthens the case for the preventive check in both medieval and early modern England. We invoke manorial data to argue the case for a preventive check on marriages in the Middle Ages.

"Klemp, M.; Weisdorf, Jacob L.";This paper explores the long-term impact on mortality of exposure to hardship in early-life. Using survival analysis, we demonstrate that birth during the great English famine of the late 1720s entailed an increased death risk throughout life among those who survived the famine years. Using demographic data from the Cambridge Group's Population History of England, we find the death risk at age 10 among the most exposed group—children born to English Midlands families of a lower socioeconomic rank—is up to 66 percent higher than that of the control group (children of similar background born in the 5 years following the famine). This corresponds to a loss of life expectancy of more than 12 years. However, evidence does not suggest that children born in the 5 years prior to the famine suffered increased death risk.;2012;The lasting damage to mortality of early-life adversity: evidence from the English famine of the late 1720s;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Klemp, Marc P. B.;To shed light on the economic-demographic mechanisms operating in the epoch of pre-industrial economic stagnation, a two-sector Malthusian model is formulated in terms of a cointegrated vector autoregressive model on error correction form. The model allows for both agricultural product wages and relative prices to affect fertility. The model is estimated using new data for the pre-industrial period in England, and the analysis reveals a strong, positive effect of agricultural wages as well as a nonnegative effect of real agricultural prices on fertility. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that there is strongly decreasing returns to scale with respect to labour in the agricultural sector and approximately constant returns to scale in the manufacturing sector. The analysis provides evidence in favour of the usual Malthusian model, as invoked by unified growth theories such as e.g. Galor and Weil (Am Econ Rev 90:806–828, 2000).;2012;Prices, wages and fertility in pre-industrial England;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

In the spirit of Johann von Thünen and Ernst Engel, we develop a theoretical model to test how access to urban demand affected agricultural development.

"KUNG, JAMES KAI-SING; Wu, Xiaogang; Wu, Yuxiao";A paradoxical feature of China's land reform of 1946–1952 is that it was conducted far more radically in the north, where land tenure relations were far less unequal, than in the south where inequality of land tenure was distinctly more acute. That landlords could only be identified in south China was attributable to the sharply more active land rental market there, and the “single-cut” policy of defining the landlords narrowly as a rentier class. We attribute the predominance of an active land rental market in south China to three socioeconomic characteristics: 1) a sharply higher inequality in land distribution, 2) an organization of agriculture whose efficiency required the “unsupervised initiatives” of family labor, and 3) a distinctly higher proportion of “absentee landlords”. Our hypothesis of land rentals being the only variable distinguishing the landlords from the rich peasants and only in south China is strongly supported by empirical evidence.;2012;Inequality of land tenure and revolutionary outcome: An economic analysis of China's land reform of 1946–1952;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Lee, Chulhee;How did geographic and occupational mobility after the Civil War differ between Union Army veterans and nonveterans? By 1880, Union veterans were more likely to migrate to a different state or region than nonveterans. The higher geographic mobility of veterans is likely attributable to their experience of traveling away from their hometowns while in service. Union veterans who held unskilled jobs prior to enlistment were more likely to move up to white-collar or farming jobs by 1880 than unskilled nonveterans. In contrast, unskilled veterans were less likely to become artisans than nonveterans. The differences in occupational mobility by veteran status might be explained by the effects of military experiences such as learning from comrades in the company.;2012;Military service and economic mobility: Evidence from the American civil war;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

We find that Dutch GDP per capita was almost twice as high as in the Yangzi delta. Agricultural productivity there was at about the same level as in the Netherlands (and England), but large productivity gaps existed in industry and services. We attempt to explain this concluding that differences in factor costs are probably behind disparities in labor productivity.;2012;Before the Great Divergence?

"MacKinnon, Mary; Parent, Daniel";Approximately 1million French-Canadians moved to the United States, mainly between 1865 and 1930, and most settled in neighboring New England. In 1900 almost a fifth of all persons born in French Canada lived in the U.S. These migrants exerted considerable efforts to maintain their language and to replicate their home country institutions, most notably the schooling system, in their new country. For decades, this resistance to assimilation generated considerable attention and concern in the U.S. The concerns are strikingly similar to those often invoked today in discussions of immigration from Hispanic countries, notably Mexico. Mexicans may not be assimilating into mainstream America as European immigrants did. We look at the convergence in the educational attainment of French Canadian immigrants across generations relative to native English-speaking New Englanders and to European Roman Catholic immigrants. The educational attainment of Franco-Americans lagged that of their fellow citizens over a long period of time. By the time of the 2000 Census, they appear to have largely achieved parity. The effects of World War II, especially military service, were very important in speeding up the assimilation process through a variety of related channels: educational attainment, language assimilation, marrying outside the ethnic group, and moving out of New England. Economic assimilation was very gradual because of the persistence of ethnic enclaves.;2012;Resisting the melting pot: The long term impact of maintaining identity for Franco-Americans in New England;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"MANZEL, KERSTIN; Baten, Jörg; Stolz, Yvonne";This study makes the first systematic attempt to trace the long-term development of Latin American numeracy, a phenomenon of great interest to economic historians in that it serves as an accurate gauge of human capital development. In order to approximate basic numeracy we use age-heaping techniques. We find that Latin America was on a path of convergence with western Europe during the early eighteenth century. During the early nineteenth century, not only did numeracy development stagnate in some Latin American countries but differences among some of them actually increased. While numeracy rates in Argentina, Uruguay, and to a lesser extent Brazil, along with Europe, underwent a significant increase in the late nineteenth century, they declined in Mexico, Ecuador, and Colombia. By performing a regression analysis, we find that, even when we control for investment in education, mass immigration contributed to human capital formation.;2012;Convergence and divergence of numeracy: the development of age heaping in Latin America from the seventeenth to the twentieth century;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
MARIOTTI, MARTINE;Anecdotal evidence shows that despite extensive restrictions on the hiring of African workers, these workers were increasingly employed in semi-skilled occupations throughout the apartheid era. This article shows that White skill acquisition throughout the apartheid era reduced the supply of White semi-skilled workers and led to the removal of job reservation, the process of reserving skilled and semi-skilled jobs for Whites. Although job reservation declined, there is little evidence of a decline in racial segregation in the labour market. It is concluded that the transformation in the labour market was driven by White economic incentives rather than any evident change in White preferences regarding racial segregation.;2012;Labour markets during apartheid in South Africa;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Using new price indexes, we offer budgetary figures in nominal and real terms for both sides.

Martínez-Galarraga, Julio;During the 19th century, the Spanish economy went through the early stages of the industrialisation process. This process developed in parallel to the growing market integration of goods and factors as a result of the liberal reforms and the construction of the railway network, with the subsequent fall in transport costs. In that period, there were major changes in the pattern of industrial location across Spain, with an increasing spatial concentration of industrial activities between the 1850s and the Spanish Civil War (1936–39) and a deeper regional specialisation. What were the forces behind these changes? On the theoretical side, the Heckscher–Ohlin model suggests that the spatial distribution of economic activity is determined by comparative advantage due to factor endowments. In turn, New Economic Geography models show the existence of a bell-shaped relationship between the process of market integration and the degree of concentration of industrial activity in the territory. This paper examines empirically the determinants of industrial location in Spain between 1856 and 1929 estimating a model that nests both Heckscher–Ohlin and NEG factors and tests the relative strength of these forces, since they are not mutually exclusive and might be at work simultaneously. The analysis of the results shows that both comparative advantage and NEG-type mechanisms were determinant drivers of industrial location in Spain, although their relative strength changed over time.;2012;The determinants of industrial location in Spain, 1856–1929;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Martinez-Soto, A.

We first provide descriptive evidence on the evolution of RCCs and their financial activity. Then, we use panel data techniques to analyze the empirical validity of the potential determinants that we have collected.

We find a negative correlation between the male illiteracy rate and both the presence of cooperatives and their credit activity. Additionally, we find that cooperatives and public granaries were likely to be located in the same provinces. The cooperatives located in the richest provinces were granted access to external funding and, in particular, to the funds provided by the Banco de España (Bank of Spain). Our estimates attest that the funds obtained from their members were far more relevant than the external funds in accounting for both the number of cooperatives and their credit activity.";2012;Spain's development of rural credit cooperatives from 1900 to 1936: the role of financial resources and formal education;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Moehling, Carolyn M.; Thomasson, Melissa A.";Enacted in 1922 and repealed in 1929, the Sheppard-Towner program gave federal matching money to states to provide public health education to mothers. We examine variation in state participation in the program, and find that the timing of women's suffrage had an important impact. However, we find that the effect of suffrage was short-lived and did not influence public health spending after the program's repeal. We also find no evidence of a “demonstration effect.” On average, the states that continued activities after Sheppard-Towner ended were those that had sizable public health budgets before the program had even begun.;2012;The Political Economy of Saving Mothers and Babies: The Politics of State Participation in the Sheppard-Towner Program;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Moser, Petra;"This paper uses program notes from the Metropolitan opera to quantify changes in ethnic preferences as a result of news of German atrocities during World War I; these data indicate that the War created a persistent shift in ethnic preferences, which effectively switched the status of German Americans from a mainstream ethnicity to an ethnic minority until the late 1920s. Difference-in-difference analyses investigate whether this shift in preferences triggered taste-based discrimination in one of the world's most elite professional settings: applications to trade at the NYSE. This analysis indicates that changes in preferences more than doubled the probability that applicants with German-sounding names would be rejected. Placebo regressions for other non-German minorities yield no evidence of taste effects. Equivalent regressions that distinguish German Jewish from other Jewish applicants, however, indicate that German Jewish applicants were similarly affected as were other Germans.";2012;Taste-based discrimination evidence from a shift in ethnic preferences after WWI;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
MULDREW, CRAIG;The purpose of this article is to estimate the workforce involved in spinning from the late sixteenth century until the eve of mechanization. In addition, the potential contribution to family earnings from spinning will be examined. Just about all of the millions of yards of woollen yarn that went into making English cloth had to be spun by women and children, but this activity has not been investigated to the extent that it deserves. Spinning was a skilled occupation where there was a great demand for the best quality product. Sources exist which make it possible to make general estimates of the amount of spinning needed in the economy, and its cost. This evidence shows that employment in spinning increased dramatically from the late seventeenth century, and continued to increase until there were probably over one million women and children employed in spinning by the mid-eighteenth century. In addition earnings increased to the extent whereby earnings from spinning could contribute over 30 per cent of household income for poorer families. This has implications for looking at trends in real wages over time, as well as for the concept of the industrious revolution.;2012;‘Th'ancient Distaff’ and ‘Whirling Spindle’: measuring the contribution of spinning to household earnings and the national economy in England, 1550–1770;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"NARITOMI, JOANA; SOARES, RODRIGO R.; ASSUNÇÃO, JULIANO J.";This article analyzes the determinants of local institutions in Brazil. We show that institutional quality and distribution of land are partly inherited from the colonial histories experienced by different areas of the country. The sugar cane boom—characterized by an oligarchic society—is associated with more land inequality. The gold boom—characterized by a heavily inefficient presence of the Portuguese state—is associated with worse governance and access to justice. We do not find similar effects for a postcolonial boom (coffee). We also find that the colonial episodes are correlated with lower provision of public goods.;2012;Institutional Development and Colonial Heritage within Brazil;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The time series are per capita hours worked and average capital income, labor income, and consumption tax rates. Uninterrupted time series of these variables are provided for an annual sample that runs from 1913 to 1938. We highlight the usefulness of these time series with several empirical applications. The per capita hours worked data are used in a growth accounting exercise to measure the contributions of capital, labor, and productivity to output growth.

"Oak, Mandar; Swamy, Anand V.";The East India Company's conquest of India was facilitated by the behavior of its Indian rivals who not only did not ally against it, but often supported it militarily. Historians have typically attributed this to myopia, the failure to understand the long-term threat represented by the Company. We examine the negotiations leading up to a key conflict, the Third Mysore War, and find that the Company's allies were not myopic. The British parliament had, in 1784, passed Pitt's India Act, which limited the scope for unprovoked military aggression by the Company in India. This had changed the behavior of the Company, making its promises more credible. This enhanced credibility made it possible for the Company to secure as allies Indian regimes that were acting strategically in their self-interest. This is a new explanation for an old puzzle.;2012;Myopia or strategic behavior?

This article investigates this view using a rich data set of marriage and death inventories for seventeenth-century Germany. It first analyzes the characteristics of debts, examining borrowing purposes, familial links, communal ties, and documentary instruments. It then explores how borrowing varied with gender, age, marital status, occupation, date, and asset portfolio. It finds that ordinary people, even in a “less-developed” economy in rural central Europe, sought to invest profitably, smooth consumption, bridge low liquidity, and hold savings in financial form.;2012;Household Debt in Early Modern Germany: Evidence from Personal Inventories;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Parent, Antoine;This article is structured as follows: the first section is based on Reinhart and Rogoff’s seminal papers (Am Econ Rev 98(2):339–344, 2008a, b, Am Econ Rev 99(2):466–472, 2009a, This time is different: eight centuries of financial folly, Princeton University Press, Princeton, 2009b, Am Econ Rev 100(2):573–578, 2010) and text book (2009), which today constitute the new cornerstones of conventional wisdom on the recurrence of financial crises throughout History, their development and aftermath. We deliver a critical view of this attempt to infer some systematic empirical relationship between debt, growth and inflation and underline the absence of core variables in this historical analysis. In Sect. 3, we go back 10 years to illustrate that conventional wisdom was much different at that time, emphasizing the peculiarity of each episode of the financial crises.

Parman, John M.;Formal schooling has a significant impact on modern agricultural productivity but there is little evidence quantifying the historical importance of schools in the early development of the American agricultural sector. I present new data from the Midwest at the start of the twentieth century showing that the emerging public schools were helping farmers successfully adapt to a variety of agricultural innovations. I use a unique dataset of farmers containing detailed geographical information to estimate both the private returns to schooling and human capital spillovers across neighboring farms. The results indicate that public schools contributed substantially to agricultural productivity at the turn of the century and that a large portion of this contribution came through human capital spillovers. These findings offer new insights into why the Midwest was a leader in the expansion of secondary education.;2012;Good schools make good neighbors: Human capital spillovers in early 20th century agriculture;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Pemberton, Hugh;In 1957, the Labour Party published radical proposals for a state earnings-related pension scheme (?national superannuation?) whose funds were to be invested in stock markets to generate high returns, and to help modernize and dynamize the British economy. This article explores a sophisticated campaign against the proposal by the insurance industry, and the resistance of the unions. In doing so, it considers the implications of this cross-class alliance, not least in terms of a possible missed opportunity to build a ?developmental state? in the UK, but also in terms of the country's increasingly inadequate and inequitable system of pension provision.;2012;The failure of ‘nationalization by attraction’: Britain's cross-class alliance against earnings-related pensions in the 1950s;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Phillips, Jim;"This article contributes to debates about the economic framework of industrial politics by examining aspects of the 1984?5 miners' strike in Britain, focusing on developments in Scotland. It focuses on strike endurance and pit-level variations in strike endurance by examining the contrasting quantity and quality of the material and moral resources available to the strikers at different collieries and in different communities. Powerful local variables in building or inhibiting strike commitment included pre-strike pit-level production, industrial relations, and the impact of debates about the economics and finances of coal-getting; incomes gained for households during the strike by married women in part-time and full-time employment; expenditure saved by households in local authority housing where rents were in effect deferred by sympathetic local authorities; communal attitudes to pits, jobs, and redundancies; the character and weight of political tradition; and the cultural as well as economic role of women. By focusing on developments at community and colliery level the article challenges dominant narratives of the strike, which remain wedded to high politics, the strategy of the union leadership, changes in energy supply and policy, and public order.";2012;Material and moral resources: the 1984–5 miners' strike in Scotland;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Pistoresi, Barbara; Rinaldi, Alberto";The nexus between trade and economic growth in Italy has been widely debated by historiography. However, there are no long run analyses on this topic that cover the whole span from Unification to present days. This paper contributes to fill this gap by investigating the relationship between real exports, imports and GDP in Italy from 1863 to 2004 by using cointegration analysis and causality tests. The outcome suggests that these variables comove in the long run but the direction of causality varies across time. In the period prior to the First World War import growth led GDP growth that in turn led export growth. Conversely, in the post-Second World War period we have a strong bidirectionality between imports and exports consequent on the increase in intra-industry trade. We also find a weak support for export-led growth and growth-led imports. This suggests that exports were not the only or the main driver of economic growth. There was probably a multiplicity of factors at work, among which high rates of capital formation and the expansion of internal demand probably stood out.;2012;Exports, imports and growth: New evidence on Italy: 1863–2004;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Pittaluga, Giovanni B.; Seghezza, Elena";The literature has underlined the existence of widespread economic regularities in the stabilization processes of the 1920s. This paper shows that political regularities also existed. The main reasons for these regularities are explained in terms of a political exchange hypothesis according to which interest groups express a demand for inflation (or deflation) and political parties seek to gain power by representing the interests of certain groups. A political equilibrium that leads to stabilization is a situation where a coalition of parties supported by social groups interested in disinflation obtains the majority. In the stabilizations that took place in European countries during the 1920s, marked political regularities can be seen and are econometrically tested. The differences in the way this equilibrium was achieved can explain the different paths to stabilization and its forms. Three stylized types of stabilizations can be identified, each of which is closely related to the historical experience of France, Germany, and Great Britain.;2012;The role of Rentiers in the stabilization processes of the 1920s;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Prentice, David;American Portland cement rose spectacularly during the 1890s from being a niche product to dominating a much larger market. The contributions of innovations, factor endowments and public science—factors highlighted as contributing to the more general American industrialization occurring at the same time—are analyzed. The successful commercialization of the rotary kiln, enabled by abundant supplies of fuels and minerals, played a key role, as did greater demand. Geological surveys, as highlighted by David and Wright, assisted in some states, but an econometric entry model does not demonstrate that they made a systematic significant contribution to the rise.;2012;The rise of the US Portland cement industry and the role of public science;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Redmount, Esther; Snow, Arthur; Warren, Ronald S.";We examine the economic consequences of an 1886 reform in Massachusetts that mandated the weekly payment of wages. We derive conditions on key elasticities of labor supply that determine the qualitative effects of the reform on workers’ effective wages and utility. We match census and administrative data on workers in a Lowell textile mill for a period encompassing the switch from monthly to weekly payment. Empirical estimates of a labor supply equation imply that the reform increased workers’ effective wage rates and welfare. The reform also decreased the mill workers’ average wage, as predicted by the theory of compensating differentials.;2012;The Effect of Wage Payment Reform on Workers’ Labor Supply, Wages, and Welfare;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

In contrast to influential previous studies, the results show that the speed of ships in my sample increased significantly during this period, potentially contributing to increasing productivity of ocean shipping. The pattern is homogeneous geographically.

SAMY, LUKE;Formed in the mid-nineteenth century, the building societies grew rapidly from their humble beginnings as localized ?self-help? institutions to become the dominant players in the house mortgage market by the interwar period. Throughout their early history, the societies presented themselves as champions of home ownership among the working classes, but historians of housing have generally disputed the role that building societies played, or could have played, in extending home ownership before the First World War. The case study presented in this article shows that it was possible for a building society to lend to working-class borrowers, and that home ownership before the First World War was not beyond the grasp of such people. While it was undoubtedly an exception within the movement, the Co-operative Permanent Building Society showed a genuine commitment to working-class owner-occupation, providing the majority of its loans to both skilled and unskilled workers on easy repayment terms. How it was able to overcome the adverse selection and moral hazard risks involved in lending to such groups of people is the focus of this article.;2012;Extending home ownership before the First World War: the case of the Co-operative Permanent Building Society, 1884–1913;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
SCHILTZ, MICHAEL;"In the macro-economic literature, Japan has at several times been treated as a canonical example of why countries joined the gold standard. On the one hand, the country has been linked to the argument that there exists a relationship between the gold standard and lowered borrowing costs; on the other hand, it has been discussed as motivated by a desire to expand its trade with gold standard countries. This article argues against both strands in the literature, and argues for a third interpretation. It demonstrates that the specificities of Japan's gold standard reveal a concern with ?original sin?, or the impossibility of raising foreign loans in Japan's own currency, and explains that there were grave costs to gold standard adoption.";2012;Money on the road to empire: Japan's adoption of gold monometallism, 1873–97;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Growth characterized much of the seventeenth century with modernization of state administration, industry and trade. In the next century, stagnation and even retrogression followed.

"Schulze, Max-Stephan; WOLF, NIKOLAUS";This article seeks to square two seemingly contradictory strands in the literature on economic development in the late nineteenth-century Habsburg Empire. On the one hand, there is an extensive historiography stressing the rise of nationalism and its close correlate of growing efforts to organize economic life along ethno-linguistic lines. On the other, there is a substantial body of research that emphasizes significant improvements in market integration across the empire as an outcome of the diffusion of industrialization and an expanding railway network, among other factors. In this article, it is argued that the process of market integration was systematically asymmetric, shaped by intensifying intra-empire nationality conflicts. While grain markets in Austria-Hungary became overall more integrated over time, they also became systematically biased: regions with a similar ethno-linguistic composition of their population came to display significantly smaller price gaps between each other than regions with different compositions. The emergence and persistence of this differential integration cannot be explained by changes in infrastructure and transport costs, simple geographical features, asymmetric integration with neighbouring regions abroad, or communication problems. Instead, differential market integration along ethno-linguistic lines was driven by the formation of ethno-linguistic networks due to intensifying conflict between groups?economic nationalism mattered.;2012;Economic nationalism and economic integration: the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the late nineteenth century;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Scott, Peter M.;This article discusses the sources of competitive advantage in the interwar British radio industry. Specifically, it examines why sections of the industry that reaped substantial monopoly rents from the downstream value chain failed to dominate the industry. During the 1920s Marconi (which controlled the fundamental UK patents) had a key cost advantage, as had other members of the ?Big Six? electrical engineering firms which formed the BBC and were granted preferential royalties. Meanwhile the valve manufacturers' cartel was also able to extract high rents from set manufacturers. The vertical integration literature suggests that input monopolists have incentives to control downstream production. Yet?in contrast to the gramophone industry, which became concentrated into two huge companies following market saturation in the 1930s?radio retained a much more competitive structure. The Big Six failed to capitalize fully on their initial cost advantages owing to logistical weaknesses in supplying markets subject to rapid technical and design obsolescence. Subsequently, during the 1930s, marketing innovations are shown to have played a key role in allowing several independents to establish successful brands. This gave them sufficient scale to provide strong bargaining positions with input suppliers, negating most of their initial cost disadvantage.;2012;The determinants of competitive success in the interwar British radio industry;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Scott, Peter M.; WALKER, JAMES T.";Interwar British retailing has been characterized as having lower productivity, less developed managerial hierarchies and methods, and weaker scale economies than its US counterpart. This article examines comparative productivity for one major segment of large-scale retailing in both countries?the department store sector. Drawing on exceptionally detailed contemporary survey data, we show that British department stores in fact achieved superior performance in terms of operating costs, margins, profits, and stock-turn. While smaller British stores had lower labour productivity than US stores of equivalent size, TFP was generally higher for British stores, which also enjoyed stronger scale economies. We also examine the reasons behind Britain's surprisingly strong relative performance, using surviving original returns from the British surveys. Contrary to arguments that British retailers faced major barriers to the development of large-scale enterprises, that could reap economies of scale and scope and invest in machinery and marketing to support the growth of their primary sales functions, we find that British department stores enthusiastically embraced the retail ?managerial revolution??and reaped substantial benefits from this investment.;2012;The British ‘failure’ that never was?

Newly discovered returns from the U.K. Ministry of Labour's 1937/38 Household Expenditure Survey are used to fully categorize expenditure smoothing via nineteen credit/savings vehicles. We find that households made extensive use of expenditure-smoothing devices. Families' reliance on expenditure-smoothing is shown to be inversely related to household income, while households also used these mechanisms more intensively during expenditure crisis phases of the family life cycle, especially the years immediately after new household formation.;2012;Working-Class Household Consumption Smoothing in Interwar Britain;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Sharp, Paul R.; Weisdorf, Jacob L.";At the end of the eighteenth century, England and France both underwent revolutions: France the French Revolution, England the industrial revolution. This note sheds new light on these contrasting experiences in the histories of England and France by looking at the evolution of real consumer prices in London and Paris in the centuries leading up to 1800. Whilst in London, building workers were facing low and stable consumer prices over the period, leaving plenty of scope for a demand-driven consumer revolution (in particular after 1650), their Parisian counterparts had to engage in a year-long grind to maintain a decent living, and often had to cut consumption to make ends meet. The exercise conducted in the present paper gives a quantitative and economic underpinning to the notion that the French revolution did not arise out of nowhere, but rather had its roots in centuries of hardship amongst working class people as they struggled to make a living.;2012;French revolution or industrial revolution?

While the reasons for stuntedness are multifactoral and involve lack of nourishment and in utero conditions, we should also give emphasis to respiratory, gastro-enteric, and bone disease along with the inadequate and sometimes harmful arrangements for convalescence, involving opiates and inadequate rest. Hard work and prevailing social attitudes slowed recovery and affected limb and organ development. While survival chances may have improved, and indeed were enhanced by measures such as targeted poor relief, quality of life for infants and children remained low and had an influence on their height as adults.

SHAW-TAYLOR, LEIGH;Historians have documented rising farm sizes throughout the period 1450?1850. Existing studies have revealed much about the mechanisms underlying the development of agrarian capitalism. However, we currently lack any consensus as to when the critical developments occurred. This is largely due to the absence of sufficiently large and geographically wide-ranging datasets but is also attributable to conceptual weaknesses in much of the literature.

Slavin, Philip;The present article seeks to identify the nature, extent, and impact of the Great Bovine Pestilence in England and Wales, between 1318 and 1350. The murrain, which killed around 62 per cent of the bovine animals in England and Wales in 1319?20, had a tremendous impact within both the seigniorial and peasant sectors of late medieval agriculture. In particular, the pestilence, which decreased the overall population of dairy cattle, depressed the overall levels of milk supply available for human consumption. Is it possible that the bovine crisis of 1319?20, and the subsequent protein shortage, were instrumental in weakening the immune system of humans and making them prone to the pestilence some 30 years later?;2012;The Great Bovine Pestilence and its economic and environmental consequences in England and Wales, 1318–50;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
SNELL, K. D. M.;This article is based on unique ?narratives of the poor?, that is, letters from poor people to their parishes of settlement, petitions to the London Refuge of the Destitute, and letters from mothers to the London Foundling Hospital, with supportive evidence from newspapers. These display fundamental concepts among the English poor, who were often poorly literate, and who comprised the majority of the population. Discussion focuses upon their understandings of ?home?, ?belonging?, ?friends?, and ?community?. These key concepts are related here to modern discussions, to set important concerns into historical perspective. ?Friends?, valuably studied by sociologists such as Pahl, had a wide meaning in the past. ?Home? meant (alongside abode) one's parish of legal settlement, where one was entitled to poor relief under the settlement/poor laws. This was where one ?belonged?. Ideas of ?community? were held and displayed even at a distance, among frequently migrant poor, who wrote to their parishes showing strong ties of attachment, right, and local obligation. This discussion explores these issues in connection with belonging and identity. It elucidates the meaning and working of poor law settlement, and is also an exploration of popular mentalities and the semi-literate ways in which these were expressed.;2012;Belonging and community: understandings of ‘home’ and ‘friends’ among the English poor, 1750–1850;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Stewart, James I.;I use a new sample of families linked between the 1860 and 1880 U.S. censuses to study the impact of migration to frontier cities on job holding. Using variation in transportation costs between different regions of the country to generate exogenous migration, I find frontier city migration had significant job-holding benefits. The impact of migration on job holding was 68% greater for immigrants than for the native born. Expectations about job holding were the most important factor in the decision to migrate to a frontier city. Clerical workers, unskilled blue-collar workers, immigrants, and the poor were also the most likely to migrate. These results show the benefits of geographic mobility and suggest the contribution of frontier cities to economic opportunity in America's past.;2012;Migration to U.S. frontier cities and job opportunity, 1860–1880;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

In a sample of 52 source and five destination countries we find selective migration determined by relative anthropometric inequality in source and destination countries. Other inequality measures confirm this. The results remain robust in OLS and Arellano–Bond approaches. We confirm the Roy–Borjas model of migrant self-selection.

Through a study of nineteenth-century monetary policy implementation, this article investigates the reasons for such success. This was mainly built on the stabilisation of central bank liquidity, not of exchange rates as assumed by the target-zone literature. Other ingredients included: the role of circulating bullion as a buffer for central bank reserves, the banking system's structural liquidity deficit towards the central bank, and the central bank's size relative to the money market.;2012;The origins of foreign exchange policy: the National Bank of Belgium and the quest for monetary independence in the 1850s;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

It traces the long-term evolution of this European institution, and offers a first pass at analysing its impact on long-term economic development. Starting in Spain in the twelfth century, parliaments gradually spread over the Latin west between 1200 and 1500. In the early modern period, parliaments declined in influence in southern and central Europe and further gained in importance in the Netherlands and Britain, resulting in an institutional ?Little Divergence? between 1500 and 1800. We discuss the background of this phenomenon in detail. Moreover, by analysing the effects of parliamentary activity on city growth we find that these differences in institutional development help to explain the economic divergence between north-western and southern and central Europe.;2012;The rise and decline of European parliaments, 1188–1789;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

During the entire period GDP per capita increased by on average 0.19% per year.

The first was the quality of property rights protection and the extent to which properties could be used as collateral. The second was the level of interest in borrowing money at the time as well as such borrowing compared with the interest rates on risk-free investments. For our case study, the small town of Edam and its hinterland, De Zeevang, in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, we demonstrate that properties were used as collateral on a large scale and that interest rates on both small and large loans were relatively low (about 6 percent). As a result, many households (whether headed by men or women) owned financial assets and/or debts, and the degree of financial sophistication was relatively high.;2012;Small is beautiful: the efficiency of credit markets in the late medieval Holland;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Vonyó, Tamás;This paper reveals the impact of wartime destruction in urban housing on regional economic growth in West Germany between 1939 and 1950. I demonstrate econometrically that the German economy remained severely dislocated as long as the urban housing stock had not been rebuilt. The recovery of urban industry was constrained by a war-induced labour shortage and, therefore, industrial capacities remained underutilized. In contrast, the growth of the rural economy was facilitated by labour expansion, which depressed industrial labour productivity. I apply instrumental variables to account for endogeneity and robust regressions to adjust for the impact of outliers.;2012;The bombing of Germany: the economic geography of war-induced dislocation in West German industry;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Wanamaker, Marianne H.;Economists frequently hypothesize that industrialization contributed to the United States’ nineteenth-century fertility decline. I exploit the circumstances surrounding industrialization in South Carolina between 1881 and 1900 to show that the establishment of textile mills coincided with a 6–10 percent fertility reduction. Migrating households are responsible for most of the observed decline. Higher rates of textile employment and child mortality for migrants can explain part of the result, and I conjecture that an increase in child-raising costs induced by the separation of migrant households from their extended families may explain the remaining gap in migrant-native fertility.;2012;Industrialization and Fertility in the Nineteenth Century: Evidence from South Carolina;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"WARD, MARIANNE; DEVEREUX, JOHN";We examine Cuban GDP over time and across space. We find that Cuba was once a prosperous middle-income economy. On the eve of the revolution, incomes were 50 to 60 percent of European levels. They were among the highest in Latin America at about 30 percent of the United States. In relative terms, Cuba was richer earlier on. Income per capita during the 1920s was in striking distance of Western Europe and the Southern United States. After the revolution, Cuba slipped down the world income distribution. Current levels of income per capita appear below their pre-revolutionary peaks.;2012;The Road Not Taken: Pre-Revolutionary Cuban Living Standards in Comparative Perspective;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
WAREHAM, ANDREW;This article begins by noting that military revolutions and civil wars in early modern Europe provide an unduly narrow framework for understanding the transition from a domain to a tax state. Taking Anglo-Saxon England as a case study, it is suggested that political restrictions led to the establishment of direct and indirect taxation, thereby providing rulers with revenues which surpassed those from domain resources. The main section of the article uses sources from coinage and wills to poetry and letters in order to give a general idea of the chronological development of a medieval tax state. This analysis challenges the views of the new fiscal historians, who argue that a collapse in a medieval domain state acts as the precondition for the emergence of a tax state. Instead, this article suggests that new policies arose because of the need of Anglo-Saxon kings and their advisers to take account of the requirements of ecclesiastical authorities, as well as a heavy revenue imperative, in paying for resistance against the Vikings. The article ends with a discussion of the comparative applications of the contexts and catalysts which lead to the adoption of pioneering fiscal policies.;2012;Fiscal policies and the institution of a tax state in Anglo-Saxon England within a comparative context;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Wild, Benjamin L.;Existing studies have shown how the royal wardrobe, the king's personal administrative office, regularly handled between a quarter and a half of the Crown's annual cash income. Despite this, the financial contribution of the wardrobe to royal finance under Henry III is not fully understood. For a reign in which debates about royal fiscal strategies are so notable a feature, this represents a significant gap. This article will supplement existing studies of wardrobe finance under Henry III by collectively analysing all 15 of the king's wardrobe accounts that are enrolled on the exchequer pipe rolls. The article makes two important findings. Firstly, the wardrobe was financially strong when the period of baronial reform began in 1258. Secondly, the wardrobe's financial strength was the result of a new, and deliberate, approach to acquiring revenue beyond the treasury that targeted sources of income that could generate cash quickly. During Henry's final years, this included greater reliance on credit. These findings suggest Henry III was not incapable of making adroit financial decisions. They also reveal that the foundations for the financial system developed by the three Edwards, which was more reliant on credit and sources of ready cash, were laid under Henry III.;2012;Royal finance under King Henry III, 1216–72: the wardrobe evidence;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Winton, Patrik;This article examines the connections between struggles over fiscal institutions and political change in Sweden during the period 1789–1809. The political situation was characterized by a divided fiscal authority: the absolute king controlled how resources were spent while the Diet controlled the operations of the Bank of Sweden and the National Debt Office. This division affected fiscal policies and how the country financed its wars. During the Napoleonic Wars, the king was unwilling to negotiate a deal with the Diet that relinquished his spending control in exchange for greater revenues to fight the war. As a consequence, he was unable to mobilize the necessary resources, which led to the loss of Finland and to his dethronement through a coup d'état organized by the elite in 1809.;2012;The political economy of Swedish absolutism, 1789-1809;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Recent research has highlighted the link between the colonial origins of inequality and its persistence in Latin America. We find that inequality varied substantially throughout the century and across the region. We identify the impact of changing factor endowments and trade on inequality using a simple theoretical framework.

Alfani, G.;This article compares the impact of plague across Europe during the seventeenth century. It shows that the disease affected southern Europe much more severely than the north. Italy was by far the area worst struck. Using a new database, the article introduces an epidemiological variable that has not been considered in the literature: territorial pervasiveness of the contagion. This variable is much more relevant than local mortality rates in accounting for the different regional impact of plague. Epidemics, and not economic hardship, generated a severe demographic crisis in Italy during the seventeenth century. Plague caused a shock to the economy of the Italian peninsula that might have been key in starting its relative decline compared with the emerging northern European countries.;2013;Plague in seventeenth-century Europe and the decline of Italy: an epidemiological hypothesis;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Alvarez-Nogal, Carlos; La Prados De Escosura, Leandro";Two distinctive regimes are distinguished in Spain over half a millennium. The first one (1270s?1590s) corresponds to a high land?labour ratio frontier economy, which is pastoral, trade-oriented, and led by towns. Wages and food consumption were relatively high. Sustained per capita growth occurred from the end of the Reconquest (1264) to the Black Death (1340s) and resumed from the 1390s only broken by late fifteenth-century turmoil. A second regime (1600s?1810s) corresponds to a more agricultural and densely populated low-wage economy which, although it grew at a pace similar to that of 1270?1600, remained at a lower level. Contrary to pre-industrial western Europe, Spain achieved its highest living standards in the 1340s, not by mid-fifteenth century. Although its death toll was lower, the plague had a more damaging impact on Spain and, far from releasing non-existent demographic pressure, destroyed the equilibrium between scarce population and abundant resources. Pre-1350 per capita income was reached by the late sixteenth century but only exceeded after 1820.;2013;The rise and fall of Spain (1270–1850);The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Arias, Luz Marina;The success of fiscal centralization and military buildup in colonial Mexico contrasts with failed similar attempts elsewhere. Why did powerful elites comply with fiscal-military reforms in eighteenth-century Mexico? I argue that the Seven Years' War provided incentives for the Crown to centralize and elites to comply by accentuating the free rider problems inherent in the provision of military defense under fiscal fragmentation. Fiscal data and history document that reforms were more successful in regions more militarily vulnerable and where benefits were more aligned between the elites and the Crown. Centralization served the elites to commit to collective cooperation.;2013;Building Fiscal Capacity in Colonial Mexico: From Fragmentation to Centralization;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Battilossi, Stefano; Escario, Regina; Foreman-Peck, James";In the second half of the 20th century, Spain provides a case of political regime change, which according to some political economy models should also lead to a shift in the cyclical nature of fiscal policy. We find that in most of the pre-democratic era, there was a strong procyclical bias to fiscal policy. Eradication began in the last years of the autocratic regime under the influence of fiscal institutional reform and perhaps learning. It was completed after the transition to democracy when countercyclical fiscal policy was reinforced in the late 1980s by membership of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. This experience, established by two separate econometric identification procedures, as well as a narrative drawing especially upon OECD and EIU reports, runs counter to the predictions of the political economy models of Lane (J Public Econ 87(12):2661–2675, 2003) and Alesina et al.

"Becker, Sascha O.; Cinnirella, Francesco; Woessmann, Ludger";While women's employment opportunities, relative wages, and the child quantity–quality trade-off have been studied as factors underlying historical fertility limitation, the role of women's education has received little attention. We combine Prussian county data from three censuses—1816, 1849, and 1867—to estimate the relationship between women's education and their fertility before the demographic transition. Despite controlling for several demand and supply factors, we find a negative residual effect of women's education on fertility. Instrumental-variable estimates using educational variation deriving from landownership concentration, as well as panel estimates controlling for fixed effects of counties, suggest that the effect of women's education on fertility is causal.;2013;Does women's education affect fertility?

"Bekar, Cliff T.; Reed, Clyde G.";The Hundred Rolls survey of 1279 documents substantially more inequality in the distribution of peasant landholdings than does the Domesday survey of 1086. Twelfth-century innovations in property rights over land induced peasants to expand the role of land market trades in their portfolio of risk-coping strategies. We argue that these events are related. Simulation analysis suggests that the primary source of the increasingly unequal distribution of peasant landholdings was the interaction between distress land sales and population growth driven by high fertility rates in households with large landholdings.;2013;Land markets and inequality: evidence from medieval England;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Blum, Matthias;Germany experienced a devastating period during the First World War due to severely restricted import possibilities and a general shortage of foodstuffs. This study uses the heights of some 4,000 individuals who served during the Second World War to quantify biological living standards from the 1900s to the 1920s, and focuses primarily on socioeconomic inequality during this period. The results suggest that generally the upper social strata, measured by fathers' occupation, exhibited the tallest average height, followed by the middle and lower classes. These socioeconomic differences became more pronounced during the First World War when the rationing system provided a limited food supply. Wealthier individuals were able to purchase additional foodstuffs on black markets. Therefore, children from upper-class families experienced only a small decline in average height compared to their counterparts from the middle and lower social strata.;2013;War, food rationing, and socioeconomic inequality in Germany during the First World War;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Bogart, Dan; Chaudhary, Latika";Railways were integral to the development of the Indian economy before World War I. This article presents new estimates of total factor productivity (TFP) for railways from 1874 to 1912, which highlight the strong performance of this key industrial sector. Railway-industry TFP growth was substantial averaging 2.3 percent per year and generating a 2.7 percent social savings for the Indian economy. A combination of factors contributed to TFP growth including greater capacity utilization, technological change, and improvements in organization and governance. Railways had higher TFP growth than most sectors in India and compared favorably with TFP growth in other countries.;2013;Engines of Growth: The Productivity Advance of Indian Railways, 1874–1912;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Although Catholic districts show on average significantly lower educational performance and spend less on primary schooling than Protestant districts, Catholicism is harmful only in a conservative milieu. We also exploit information on absenteeism of pupils from school to separate provision of schooling from use of schooling.;2013;Under which conditions does religion affect educational outcomes?;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Borowiecki, Karol Jan;Research on the causes of conflict-induced migration is hindered by the lack of adequately disaggregated data. The underlying study overcomes this problem through the use of historical data on 164 prominent classical composers born after 1800. I analyze the impact of war on the probability to emigrate of composers, investigate the associated dynamics and shed light on the choice of a destination country in times of war. I find that the incidence of inter-state wars increases composers’ probability to emigrate by around 7 % and the incidence of intra-state wars by roughly 19 %. The results imply that conflict impacts the migration intensity with a lag of approximately 1 year. Furthermore, the choice of a destination country is significantly affected by the incidence of war and less efficient from a career’s point of view during war. Finally, I find heterogeneous responses to war based on individual’s quality. While the better composers are more likely to emigrate in times of peace, it is not so anymore if a war breaks out. In times of war, all artists are affected by war and are prone to emigrate;2013;Conflict-induced migration of composers: an individual-level study;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Braun, Sebastian T.; Kvasnicka, Michael";Women's suffrage led to one of the greatest enfranchisements in history. Voting rights, however, were not won by force or threats thereof, a fact leading political economy theories find hard to explain. Studying the timing of suffrage extensions in US states between 1869 and 1919, we find that a scarcity of women strongly promoted early transitions to women's suffrage. Such scarcity significantly reduced the political costs and risks for male grantors of the suffrage. It might also have made women's suffrage attractive as a means to attract more women.;2013;Men, women, and the ballot: Gender imbalances and suffrage extensions in the United States;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Bridji, Slim;Using the business cycle accounting framework [Chari V., P. Kehoe and E. McGrattan 2007. Business cycle accounting. Econometrica 75, 781–836.], this paper sheds new light on the French Great Depression. Frictions that reduce the efficiency with which factor inputs are used (efficiency wedge) were the primary factor in the economic downturn. The decline in consumption can be attributed to distortions in the Euler equation (investment wedge). In addition, frictions creating a gap between the marginal rate of substitution and the marginal product of labor (labor wedge) contributed to the slowdown of the economy after 1936. This drop in the efficiency wedge might have resulted from financial frictions, whereas the investment wedge might have been caused by financial frictions due to agency costs. Institutional changes in the labor market could serve as a potential explanation for the decline of the labor wedge after 1936.;2013;The French Great Depression: A business cycle accounting analysis;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Broadberry, Stephen N.; Campbell, Bruce M. S.; van Leeuwen, Bas";Britain's labour force industrialised early. The industrial and service sectors already accounted for 40% of the labour force in 1381, and a substantial further shift of labour out of agriculture occurred between 1522 and 1700. From the early seventeenth century rising agricultural labour productivity underpinned steadily increasing employment in industry and services, so that by 1759 agriculture's share of the labour force had shrunk to 37% and industry's grown to 34%. Thereafter, industry's output acceleration during the Industrial Revolution owed more to gains in labour productivity consequent upon mechanisation than the expansion of employment.;2013;When did Britain industrialise?

We find that RFC's purchases of preferred stock—which did not increase indebtedness or subordinate depositors—increased the chances that a bank would survive the financial crisis, but RFC loans did not.

"Carlin, Wendy; Schaffer, Mark; Seabright, Paul";Two decades after the end of central planning, we investigate the extent to which the advantages bequeathed by planning in terms of high investment in physical infrastructure and human capital compensated for the costs in allocative inefficiency and weak incentives for innovation. We assemble and analyse three separate types of evidence. First, we find that countries that were initially relatively poor prior to planning benefited more, as measured by long-run GDP per capita levels, from infrastructure and human capital than they suffered from weak market incentives. For initially relatively rich countries the opposite is true. Second, using various measures of physical stocks of infrastructure and human capital we show that at the end of planning, formerly planned countries had substantially different endowments from their contemporaneous market economy counterparts. However, these differences were much more important for poor than for rich countries. Finally, we use firm-level data to measure the cost of a wide range of constraints on firm performance, and we show that after more than a decade of transition in 2002–05, poor ex-planned economies differ much more from their market counterparts, in respect to both good and bad aspects of the planning legacy, than do relatively rich ones. However, the persistent beneficial legacy effects disappeared under the pressure of strong growth in the formerly planned economies in the run-up to the global financial crisis.;2013;Soviet power plus electrification: What is the long-run legacy of communism?;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Nineteenth century Oxfordshire is used as a case study, but the method can also be applied at a multi-county and national level. The results show that the development of railways in nineteenth-century Oxfordshire accelerated a long-term shake-out in the market system, whereby rural markets disappeared and urban markets grew.

Initially industry was largely artisanal, and located in the former political capitals; but even then the waterfalls of the subalpine north-west attracted what factory industry there was. Contrary to widespread opinion, in the aftermath of Unification the industrial and overall growth leaders were actually in the south, where selected provinces reaped the gains from the freer foreign trade, and infrastructure investment, that accompanied the loss of independence. Over the later nineteenth century industry concentrated into the ?industrial triangle?; but even there industrialization remained sharply local, and excluded the right bank of the upper Po. The early twentieth century, in turn, brought a measure of industrial diffusion?to the centre/north-east, where it was tied to the production of perishables on recently improved land?and concentration within the north-western triangle itself, into its major cities, as progress in energy transmission effectively moved the waterfalls into the plains.";2013;Through the magnifying glass: provincial aspects of industrial growth in post-Unification Italy;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

We construct a very detailed panel data set of yearly consumption in the 69 Italian provinces from 1871 to 1913 and use it to estimate the demand for tobacco products. We find support for the Becker and Murphy (J Polit Econ 96:675–700, 1988) rational addiction model. We also find that, in the period considered, tobacco was a normal good in Italy: aggregate tobacco consumption increased with income. Subsequently, we consider separately the four types of products which aggregate tobacco comprises (fine-cut tobacco, snuff, cigars, and cigarettes), and tentatively suggest that habit formation was a stronger factor on the persistence of consumption than physical addiction. The paper ends by showing that the introduction of the Bonsack machine in the early 1890s did not coincide with changes in the structure of the demand for tobacco, suggesting cost-driven technological change.;2013;The demand for tobacco in post-unification Italy;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Clark, Gregory;What were income trends before the Industrial Revolution? Clark (2007b) argued both theoretically and empirically that pre-industrial income fluctuated, but was not trending upwards, a position Persson (2008) labeled “the Malthus Delusion.” Clark (2010a), in particular, estimated that pre-industrial English income was as high on average as in 1800. In contrast, Broadberry et al. (2011) estimate that income tripled between 1270 and 1800. One test of early income estimates is the share employed in farming. This paper, focusing on the poll tax returns of 1379–1381, shows that only 56–59% of the English population was in farming or fishing.

To explain this puzzle within a puzzle, we show that the benefit of the marginal nutrient exceeded the cost throughout the antebellum era. As a result, it paid for slave owners to engage in the supplemental feeding of slaves, which increased their stature. While this is consistent with a productivity explanation of increased stature, we also argue that informational asymmetries played an important role in the market for slaves. Slave owners had an incentive to signal that their slaves were high-productivity laborers by supplying them with additional food, which positively impacted slave heights. We provide evidence that, distinct from a productivity explanation, signaling mattered in the trend of slave heights.;2013;Nutrition and signaling in slave markets: a new look at a puzzle within the antebellum puzzle;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Cummins, Neil;It has been long established that the demographic transition began in eighteenth-century France, yet there is no consensus on exactly why fertility declined. This analysis links fertility life histories to wealth at death data for four rural villages in France, 1750?1850. For the first time, the wealth?fertility relationship during the onset of the French fertility decline can be analysed. Where fertility is declining, wealth is a powerful predictor of smaller family size. This article argues that fertility decline in France was a result of changing levels of economic inequality, associated with the 1789 Revolution. In cross-section, the data support this hypothesis: where fertility is declining, economic inequality is lower than where fertility is high.;2013;Marital fertility and wealth during the fertility transition: rural France, 1750–1850;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Cvrcek, Tomas;This article analyses a new series of prices and wages stretching back to 1827 for the provinces of the Habsburg Empire. These real wage series are the first continuous and consistent indicator of changing living standards in this part of Europe during industrialization. They show that while the living standards stagnated throughout the monarchy prior to 1850s, the West (unlike the East) was able to launch onto a path of continuous growth in the second half of the century. The empire experienced little convergence onto the living standards of its neighbors and even internally the convergence record is mixed.;2013;Wages, Prices, and Living Standards in the Habsburg Empire, 1827–1910;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Dari-Mattiacci, Giuseppe;"This article shows how asymmetric information shaped slavery by determining the likelihood of manumission. A theoretical model explains the need to offer positive incentives to slaves working in occupations characterized by a high degree of asymmetric information. As a result, masters freed (and, more generally, rewarded) slaves who performed well. The model's implications are then tested against the available evidence: both in Rome and in the Atlantic world, slaves with high asymmetric information tasks had greater chances of manumission. The analysis also sheds light on the master's choices of carrots versus sticks and of labor versus slavery.

Dennison, Tracy K.;This article examines questions about contract enforcement in the absence of formal legal institutions, using archival evidence for one particular rural society in pre-emancipation Russia. The evidence presented indicates that enforcement services provided by the local landlord made it possible for Russians from different socioeconomic and legal strata to engage in a wide variety of contractual transactions. However, this system had significant drawbacks in that the poorest serfs could not afford these services and no serf had recourse beyond his local estate.;2013;Contract enforcement in Russian serf society, 1750–1860;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Depew, Briggs; Fishback, Price V.; Rhode, Paul W.";The Agricultural Adjustment Act has often been held responsible for the rapid reduction of share tenants and sharecroppers (laborers paid shares of the crop) during the 1930s. However, this conclusion has come with limited empirical backing. We shed new light on the consequences of this New Deal policy by empirically testing the role that the AAA cotton reduction program had on the displacement of share tenants and sharecroppers in the Cotton South. The results suggest that the AAA played a significant role in the displacement of black and white sharecroppers and black managing tenants even though it was a violation of AAA contracts for landlords to displace these workers.;2013;New deal or no deal in the Cotton South: The effect of the AAA on the agricultural labor structure;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Di Matteo, Livio;Historical wealth micro-data from Wentworth County, Ontario examines the evolution of female and male wealth holding in the wake of 19th century property rights legislation. The results reveal that male wealth was greater than female wealth in Wentworth County but that over time the gap declined. Female wealth rose continually in Wentworth County over the period 1872 to 1927 and by 1927 average female wealth was 61% that of males compared to about 17% in 1872. However, despite the onset of the married women's property legislation in the late nineteenth century and in particular the Ontario Married Women's Property Act in 1884, women's wealth does not appear to be consistently and significantly related to variables designed to capture the effect of the property law legislation using regression analysis. Given late nineteenth century economic and social factors that operated to improve the material and wealth status of women, the property rights legislation was a correlating rather than a causal factor in the growth of women's wealth. At best, the property law changes may have induced more financial asset holding within the wealth portfolios of women though male financial asset share of wealth also increased. As a result, the gender redistribution of wealth that began in the late 19th century was part of a broad set of social and economic changes rather than the result of a set of legal changes.;2013;Women, wealth and economic change: An assessment of the impact of women's property law in Wentworth County, Ontario, 1872–1927;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
DODGSON, JOHN;This article presents an input?output table for England and Wales for the year 1688 which is based on the extensive dataset compiled by Gregory King in the 1690s, together with other contemporary and modern material relating to the end of the seventeenth century. As well as showing the inter-relationships between the different parts of the economy, the data in the table can be used to compute national income and the shares of different sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing, and services in total value added. Further, the approach used to compile the table provides a way to subject King's data to as much independent assessment as is possible given alternative sources of information. Sensitivity analysis is used to assess the impact on national income and sector shares of alternative estimates of the grain harvest, metal manufacture, and service sector output.;2013;Gregory King and the economic structure of early modern England: an input–output table for 1688;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
DOMENECH, JORDI;This article looks at the causes of rural conflict in 1930s Spain. Rather than stressing bottom-up forces of mobilization linked to poor harvests and rural unemployment or the inability of the state to enforce reformist legislation, this article explores the role of state policy in sorting out the acute coordination and collective action problems of mobilizing rural labourers. This is done by looking at the effects of intervention on rural labour markets in dry-farming areas of Spain (parts of Castile and of Andalusia). Given the difficulties of constructing a conclusive test of the hypothesis, three indirect testing strategies are used. The first is an examination of the qualitative evidence on the functioning of labour markets in dry-farming areas of Spain. Second, because the argument presented in this article implies the existence of severe restrictions on the labour supply of rural labourers during the harvest in the early 1930s, harvest-to-winter wage ratios before and after the passing of legislation are studied. Finally, the diffusion of union offices and general strikes in several dry-farming provinces of Spain is examined, in order to show that alternative hypotheses to explain rural conflict are not consistent with the historical record.;2013;Rural labour markets and rural conflict in Spain before the Civil War (1931–6);The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Dudley, Christopher;Economic growth and change in eighteenth-century Britain, both the expansion of pre-industrial commercial society and the industrial revolution itself, have been explored using a variety of approaches. This article highlights a relatively ignored aspect of the problem, arguing that the state, politics, and political economic ideology played a central role. In particular, the early eighteenth-century political victory of a version of political economy associated with the Whig party, which centred on manufacturing and consumption, was a prerequisite for the economic developments later in the century. The article begins by describing a political economy of manufacturing and its rival, a political economy of re-exporting associated with the Tory party. It then explains how and why a political economy of manufacturing became dominant, examining both political elites and ordinary voters and petitioners. The growth of manufacturing and consumption must be understood, therefore, as political as much as economic events.;2013;Party politics, political economy, and economic development in early eighteenth-century Britain;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"DUPONT, BRANDON; WEISS, THOMAS";There were substantial fluctuations in the number of American overseas travelers, especially before World War Two. These fluctuations in travel around the long-term upward trend are the focus of this paper. We first identify those fluctuations in the data and then try to explain the patterns. We show that, despite the impact of a myriad of episodic events, fluctuations in travel can be explained to a large extent by changes in the direct price of travel, changes in per capita GDP and wealth in the United States, and by periods of armed conflict.;2013;Variability in overseas travel by Americans, 1820–2000;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Duran, Xavier;Construction of the first transcontinental railroad, financed with large federal subsidies, is an important event in American history. Were the subsidies necessary to induce private investment in the railroad? The ex-ante investment decision examined uses contemporary reports and a simulation model to show that investors expected the railroad to be profitable. Evidence also shows that the railroad created political conflicts in Congress between the North and South. The secession removed the South as a disputant in Congress, reducing short-term political conflict but not long-term conflict. Subsidies reduced political risk, rather than transport market failure, and encouraged private investment.;2013;The First U.S. Transcontinental Railroad: Expected Profits and Government Intervention;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Edlinger, Cécile; Merli, Maxime; Parent, Antoine";The geographical distributions of French and British foreign investment portfolios differ markedly before World War I. Did French portfolios favor European investments just as British portfolios favored “New World” assets? Should economic rationality have encouraged investors to invest widely in the “New World” rather than in Europe? Combining Modern Portfolio Theory and a new data set comprising assets listed on the Paris and London Stock Exchanges, we show that investing in the “New World” did not yield higher returns than investing in Europe.

Edvinsson, Rodney Benjamin;Although the historical national accounts of Sweden are among the most detailed in the world, there is scope for improvement. This study revises previous historical estimates of Swedish GDP. Agricultural output is upgraded for the nineteenth century following recent research by Swedish agrarian historians on the underestimation of official statistics. Estimates of annual fluctuations before 1861 are significantly improved by using new sources on yield ratios of harvests. For manufacturing, home industries are added, in accordance with modern international guidelines (2008 SNA). The study concludes that early nineteenth-century Sweden was not as poor relative to other West European countries as previously thought.;2013;New annual estimates of Swedish GDP, 1800–2010;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Edvinsson, Rodney Benjamin;This paper reconstructs an annual volume series of GDP and GDP per capita for Sweden within present borders 1620–1800, extending the annual series that exist from 1800 onwards. Annual fluctuations of GDP are estimated from the annual fluctuations of harvests, which in the nineteenth century were strongly correlated with each other. Long-term trends are determined based on estimates of the values added of various activities for a few benchmark years. The paper shows that the long-term trend of GDP per capita increased modestly during the studied period, a different development from real wages that fell substantially. Henceforth, available data on real wages are at best a quite weak indicator of the development of GDP per capita. If Sweden is representative of Western Europe, the new data indicate a somewhat slower growth than assumed by Maddison. The increase in GDP per capita occurred in the seventeenth century and came entirely from non-agricultural activities, especially mining, public services, trade and transports. The lack of dynamism in the aggregate economy is explained by the dominance of agriculture. Per capita agricultural production displayed a stagnating tendency. Nevertheless, the expansion of the population in the eighteenth century was largely made possible by the increased use of iron tools in agriculture. Without technological progress, the strong population growth would probably have led to decreased per capita production.;2013;Swedish GDP 1620–1800: stagnation or growth?;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Esteves, Rui Pedro;This paper studies the role of market-based solutions in the enforcement of sovereign debt contracts. A simple theoretical framework implies that there is scope for bondholders' committees to improve the governance of the market, as measured by the frequency and outcome of defaults. We test this hypothesis with an original data set of sovereign defaults, 1870–1913. This first period of financial globalization is an ideal test ground as it was immune to interventions by multilaterals, which can aggravate moral hazard problems during arrears. The empirical results confirm the potential relevance of bondholder's self-help organizations for ordered workouts of defaults.;2013;The bondholder, the sovereign, and the banker: sovereign debt and bondholders' protection before 1914;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Federico, Giovanni; Sharp, Paul Richard";This article investigates the costs of transport regulation using the example of agricultural markets in the US. Using a large database of prices by state of agricultural commodities, we find that dispersion fell for many commodities until the First World War. We demonstrate that this reflected changes in transport costs which in turn in the long run depended on productivity growth in railroads. The year 1920 marked a change in this relationship, however, and between the First and Second World Wars we find considerable disintegration of agricultural markets, ultimately as a consequence of the 1920 Transportation Act. We argue that this benefited railroad companies in the 1920s and workers in the 1930s, and we put forward an estimate of the welfare losses for the consumers of railroad services (that is, agricultural producers and final consumers).;2013;The cost of railroad regulation: the disintegration of American agricultural markets in the interwar period;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
FENSKE, JAMES;Although Nigeria's Benin region was a major rubber producer in 1960, the industry faltered before 1921. I use labor scarcity and state capacity to explain why rubber did not take hold in this period. The government was unable to protect Benin's rubber forests from over-exploitation. Plantations found it difficult to recruit workers, and the government was unwilling to allow expatriates to acquire land. Colonial officials promoted the development of “communal” plantations, but these suffered due to labor scarcity and a state that was short on staff and equipment, and dependent on local chiefs.;2013;“Rubber will not keep in this country”: Failed development in Benin, 1897–1921;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
FIELD, JACOB F.;Domestic service was a vital occupational sector in England in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries?particularly for women. This article uses a new series of wage observations from across England, focusing on rural areas. Analysis of the dataset shows that wages paid to servants in rural England slightly increased over the period considered, but at uneven rates dependent on region and precise occupation of servant. The majority of servants, particularly maids, did not experience any significant increase in the wages they were paid. This article also shows a widening wage gap between male and female servants. When differences between regions were analysed, it was shown that the wages paid to servants did not match the model of the north becoming the high wage zone of England by the mid-nineteenth century, although rates of growth there were the highest. For servants the south generally remained an area of higher wages even in the mid-nineteenth century. Geography was probably not the key variable in determining wage levels. The type of household in which a servant was employed was more important than where it was located. The most important variables were the servants' gender, and their occupations in the household.;2013;Domestic service, gender, and wages in rural England, c.1700–1860;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

In the longer term counties receiving more war spending per capita during the war experienced greater population growth, but growth in per capita measures of economic activity showed little relationship with per capita war spending.;2013;Second World War spending and local economic activity in US counties, 1939–58;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Fleck, Robert K.;The Democratic Party's electoral success during the 1930s has long intrigued politicians and scholars. To gain new insight into that success, this paper examines the striking heterogeneity in county-level support for Roosevelt. Even though the Depression's effects and the New Deal's benefits were famously widespread, only some parts of the country responded with large and durable partisan shifts. One reason is that several factors, including pre-New Deal economic hardship, Dust Bowl conditions, and New Deal spending, appear to have had effects that were largely transitory (i.e., faded by 1940). A complementary reason is that swing electorates can, and did, swing both ways. By contrast, several other variables – notably economic and demographic factors discussed in the previous literature – are related to relatively durable shifts. Finally, heterogeneity in marginal responses may have mattered greatly to national-level Democratic success. By demonstrating which factors were transitory and which were more durable, this paper illuminates the New Deal Realignment and, more generally, the influence of economic conditions and distributive policy on voter behavior.;2013;Why did the electorate swing between parties during the Great Depression?;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Fleissig, Adrian R.; Whitney, Gerald A.";Obtaining estimates of demand relationships between goods and services during the periods of rationing, that characterized the first half of the twentieth century, is complicated by the uncertainty about both the period and the goods for which rationing is binding. Consequently, researchers have turned to using the difference between virtual and observed prices as an indicator of binding rationing. However, this often requires using external data from another country or an unrationed sample period to estimate virtual prices. In contrast, our methodology uses data from the rationed period to estimate virtual prices. The ration constrained revealed preference approach provides virtual prices that can be used to estimate a system of free demands. We then estimate the impact that rationing had on expenditure on unrationed goods using relationships between free and rationed demand elasticities. We apply our methodology to inter war period data from Belgium.;2013;Virtual prices and the impact of house rationing in Belgium on consumer choices;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Földvári, Péter; van Leeuwen, Bas";In this paper, we revisit the relationship between educational and income inequalities in a historical perspective, using a newly developed annual dataset of average years of education in Europe. Theoretically one would expect a reduction in educational inequality should, given the positive correlation between education level and income, initially increase and then, at a later stage, reduce income inequality. Testing for such a Kuznets-type relationship between educational and income inequalities yields an unexpected result: we find the expected inverse U-curve before the 1950s, but the relationship changes into a normal U-curve afterward. We explain this observation by a change in the trend of skill premium during the second half of the twentieth century due to an increased relative demand for skills, which contradicts the usual assumption of decreasing returns to education. Due to lack of appropriate wage data, we cannot directly capture this effect. Yet, once we use an instrumental variable estimation method to filter out the effect of the omitted skill premium, the expected inverse U-curve also appears for the latter decades of the twentieth century.;2013;Educational and income inequality in Europe, ca. 1870–2000;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Fourie, Johan;How comfortable was the life of the average settler in the Dutch Cape Colony of the eighteenth century? The generally accepted view is of a poor, subsistence economy, with little progress being made in the 143 years of Dutch rule (1652?1795). This article shows that new evidence from probate inventory and auction roll records contradicts earlier historical accounts. These documents bear witness to a relatively affluent settler society, comparable to some of the most prosperous regions of eighteenth-century England and Holland. This detailed picture of the material wealth of the Colony should inspire a revision of the standard accounts.

"Gazeley, Ian; Horrell, Sara";The welfare of agricultural labourers has recently received renewed interest in both establishing living standards for a baseline group over the long term, and assessing the energy available for increased physical labour in the eighteenth century. Disagreement persists. This article examines a key aspect of agricultural labourers' families' welfare: nutrient consumption. We utilize datasets of the diets of agricultural labourers' households for 1787?96, 1835?46, 1863, 1893, and 1912, to analyse the availability of calories and 11 key nutrients. Self-provisioned foodstuffs are incorporated and adjustments are made for beer consumption. Deficiency is computed against household needs. The results corroborate the general levels of calorie availability identified in agricultural production accounts for the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries and assess these as sufficient for productive agricultural labour. However, no improvement is found in the nutritional aspect of household welfare between 1787?96 and 1835?46, thus endorsing pessimistic views of living standards for this group over this time period. Gains were evident in the next half-century, but these improvements were neither consistent nor dramatic and left a large minority of these households with nutrient deficiencies even in the twentieth century.;2013;Nutrition in the English agricultural labourer's household over the course of the long nineteenth century;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Although calorie intake was maintained, we find a closing of the nutritional gap between skilled and unskilled workers. We also find reductions in intakes of several key vitamins. These were possibly side effects of the food control system. For many unregulated foodstuffs, such as fruit and vegetables, prices rose dramatically as production fell, and this may have been what caused the fall in vitamin C intake among skilled workers.;2013;The First World War and working-class food consumption in Britain;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Gray, Rowena;This paper uses new data on the task content of occupations to present a new picture of the labor market effects of technological change in pre-WWII United States. I show that, similar to the recent computerization episode, the electrification of the manufacturing sector led to a “hollowing out” of the skill distribution whereby workers in the middle of the distribution lost out to those at the extremes. OLS estimates show that electrification increased the demand for clerical, numerical, planning and people skills relative to manual skills while simultaneously reducing relative demand for the dexterity-intensive jobs which comprised the middle of the skill distribution. Thus, early twentieth century technological change was unskill-biased for blue collar tasks but skill-biased on aggregate. These results are in line with the downward trend in wage differentials within U.S. manufacturing up to 1950.;2013;Taking technology to task: The skill content of technological change in early twentieth century United States;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Greasley, David; Madsen, Jakob B.";The collapse of residential construction was a notable feature of the Great Depression in the USA. The housing slump did not simply follow the downward shifts in income: rather residential investment collapse helped to precipitate the Great Depression. By utilizing an augmented Tobin’s q model of residential investment, we show that heightened uncertainty surrounding builders’ anticipated profits largely explains the housing slump in the key year of 1930. A combination of forces, including house prices, building costs, credit and demand constraints, and financing costs, is shown to explain the longer decline of residential investment in 1928–1933.

The article then examines how the composition of that wealth varied according to the wealth holder's location in the urban hierarchy and distance from London. It points out important geographical differences in both the scale and nature of wealth holding and raises questions about the implications of these findings.;2013;Geographies of wealth: real estate and personal property ownership in England and Wales, 1870–1902;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Green, Tiffany L.; Hamilton, Tod G.";A growing empirical literature in economics and sociology documents the existence of more favorable social and economic outcomes among mixed-race blacks compared to non-mixed race blacks. However, few researchers consider whether the advantages associated with mixed-race status extend to mortality. To address this gap in the literature, we employ unique data from the 1880 North Carolina Mortality Census records in conjunction with data from 1880 U.S. Census of Population for North Carolina to examine whether mulatto (mixed-race) blacks experienced mortality advantages over to their colored (non-mixed race) counterparts from June 1879 to May 1880. For men between the ages of 20 and 44, estimates demonstrate that all black males, both mulatto and colored, were more likely than whites to die during the survey period. Although our results indicate that there is no statistically significant difference in mortality between mulatto and colored black men, we find a substantial mortality advantage associated with mixed-race status among women.;2013;Beyond black and white: Color and mortality in post-reconstruction era North Carolina;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Grossman, Richard S.; IMAI, MASAMI";The recent financial turmoil highlights the incentive of highly leveraged financial institutions to take excessive risk, given the protection of limited liability. During the nineteenth and early twentieth century, many banks operated under liability rules which obligated shareholders to bear larger costs of bank insolvency in the form of contingent, or even unlimited, liability. This article examines the empirical relationship between the size of banks' contingent liability and their risk-taking behaviour using data on British banks from 1878 to 1912. We find that banks with more contingent liability appear to have taken less risk. We also find evidence that the risk-reducing effects of contingent liability were larger for banks with higher leverage, suggesting that contingent capital mitigated the moral hazard problem at banks.;2013;Contingent capital and bank risk-taking among British banks before the First World War;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Hanes, Christopher; Rhode, Paul W.";Most American financial crises of the postbellum gold standard era were caused by fluctuations in the cotton harvest due to exogenous factors such as weather. The transmission channel ran through export revenues and financial markets under the pre-1914 monetary regime. A poor cotton harvest depressed export revenues and reduced international demand for American assets, which depressed American stock prices, drained deposits from money center banks and precipitated a business cycle downturn—conditions that bred financial crises. The crises caused by cotton harvests could have been prevented by an American central bank, even under gold standard constraints.;2013;Harvests and Financial Crises in Gold Standard America;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Hanus, Jord;This article studies the welfare effects of economic growth in the early modern Low Countries. It applies the recently developed concept of ?real inequality? to a case study of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century ?s-Hertogenbosch in the Southern Netherlands and demonstrates, by incorporating relative price movements, that specific (and in this case stagnant) nominal income inequality trajectories may disguise underlying shifts in real inequality that are influenced by socially biased relative prices. The analysis is then extended to include changes in demography and household size, which reveals a second important limitation in the study of long-term economic inequality. In contrast to the stagnation and eventual decline in nominal inequality seen in ?s-Hertogenbosch during the long sixteenth century (1500?1650), this broadened concept of ?augmented? real inequality in fact suggests the occurrence of a significant upturn during the first half of the sixteenth century. Furthermore, while nominal inequality had decreased, real inequality appears to have been higher by the middle of the seventeenth century than it had been around 1500. The study of global and/or long-term inequality, in particular, would benefit greatly from a proper social, economic, and historical contextualization of these trends, not least in terms of the social biases in relative prices and household composition.;2013;Real inequality in the early modern Low Countries: the city of ’s-Hertogenbosch, 1500–1660;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Hashino, Tomoko; Otsuka, Keijiro";The Kiry? silk weaving district, located 200 kilometres north of Tokyo, has been one of the most advanced silk weaving districts since the Tokugawa period (1603?1868). In the 1870s, it was a pioneer in the export of silk products from Japan and the leading producer of traditional Japanese kimono and obi (sash belts) for domestic markets. This study finds that the developmental process of the Kiry? district from 1895 to 1930 can be divided into at least two phases, that is, one of gradual growth based on an inter-firm division of labour using hand looms and one of dynamic development based on the factory system using power looms. Weaving manufacturers-cum-contractors pioneered gradual growth by sub-contracting with rural village out-weavers and with a number of specialized, supporting firms in Kiry? town, and grew faster than factory production systems. New joint-stock firms played the role of genuine entrepreneurs by introducing power looms, thereby realizing significant economies of scale. During this new phase, the weaving manufacturers-cum-contractors survived and also introduced new production systems.;2013;Hand looms, power looms, and changing production organizations: the case of the Kiryū weaving district in early twentieth-century Japan;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Heckelman, Jac C.; Dougherty, Keith L.";Previous studies of the U.S. Constitutional Convention have relied on votes recorded for the state blocs or a relatively small number of delegate votes. We construct a new data set covering delegate votes on over 600 substantive roll calls, and use the data in several ways. First, we estimate a single dimensional position for the delegates which reflects their overall voting patterns. Next, we explain these positions using a variety of delegate and constituent variables. Finally, we suggest a method for identifying state and floor medians, which can be used to predict equilibrium outcomes at the Convention.;2013;A Spatial Analysis of Delegate Voting at the Constitutional Convention;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Inflation was transmitted between 1929 and 1931 when the world silver price was falling; while deflation was transmitted during 1932 and 1934 when the world silver price was rising. Using micro-level evidence and counterfactual simulations, we show that the exchange rate was the main shock transmission channel, and silver stocks played an insignificant role.";2013;Silver fetters?

Holmlund, Bertil;"The paper studies wage and employment determination in the Swedish business sector from the mid-1910s to the late 1930s. This period includes the boom and bust cycle of the early 1920s as well as the Great Depression of the early 1930s. The events of the early 1920s are particularly intriguing, involving inflation running at an annual rate of 30 percent followed by a period of sharp deflation where nominal wages and prices fell by 30 percent and unemployment increased from 5 to 30 percent. We examine whether relatively standard wage and employment equations can account for the volatile economic development during the interwar years. By and large, the answer is a qualified yes. Industry wages were responsive to industry-specific firm performance, suggesting a significant role for “insider forces” in wage determination. Unemployment had a strong downward impact on wages. There is evidence that reductions in working time added to wage pressure; yet, estimates of labor demand equations suggest that cuts in working time may have slightly increased employment as firms substituted workers for hours per worker.";2013;Wage and employment determination in volatile times: Sweden 1913–1939;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Horrell, Sara; Oxley, Deborah";Did the male breadwinner get more household resources, and if so, why? A dearth of direct information on intra-household processes makes it hard to answer. Instead reliance has to be placed on indirect evidence. Here, we investigate these processes more rigorously. We start by outlining theoretical models of household decision making (unitary, a particular variant of this, the impoverished unitary, and bargaining) and identify how gender bias in various outcomes might manifest itself under each of these scenarios. We then review a range of empirical results to ascertain if they indicate gender bias and how they accord with these alternative scenarios. In particular, we reconsider our own results which identified gender bias through econometric analysis of expenditure data, analyse household nutrition, refer to recent work which has indicated a differential impact of regional dietary patterns on the heights of men and women, report our findings on male and female body mass over the life cycle, and review the literature on differential mortality. These results indicate that household decision making may have resulted from bargaining and, while remunerated work played a role in determining the bargaining positions of men and women, the story was often more complex. Other factors, which affected relative worth, emerge as important.;2013;Bargaining for basics?

Humphries, Jane;"Quantitative and qualitative analysis of a large number of autobiographies by working men who lived through the industrial revolution has demonstrated that there was an upsurge in child labour in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries with children's work entrenched in traditional sectors as well as spreading in newly mechanized factories and workshops. I have interpreted this rise in terms of the appearance of a new equilibrium in the early industrial economy with more and younger children at work. The new equilibrium, in turn, was related to a number of co-incidental developments including: an increase in the relative productivity of children as a result of mechanization, new divisions of labour, and changes in the organization of work; the dynamics of competitive dependence linking labour market and families; high dependency ratios within families; stumbling male wages and pockets of poverty; family instability; and breadwinner frailty. The establishment of these links forges a new synchronization between revised views of the industrial revolution and a revisionist history of child labour.";2013;Childhood and child labour in the British industrial revolution;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Humphries, Jane;The new meta-narrative of the industrial revolution contends that Britain was a high wage economy and that this itself caused industrialization. Contemporary inventions, although derived from scientific discoveries shared with mainland Europe, could only be profitable in the context of Britain's factor prices. Therefore, important inventions were only developed in Britain where they enabled access to a growth path that transcended trajectories associated with more labour-intensive production methods. The criticism presented here concerns perspective and methodology. The account of the high wage economy is misleading because it focuses on men and male wages, underestimates the relative caloric needs of women and children, and bases its view of living standards on an ahistorical and false household economy. A more accurate picture of the structure and functioning of working-class households provides an alternative explanation of inventive and innovative activity in terms of the availability of cheap and amenable female and child labour and thereby offers a broader interpretation of the industrial revolution.;2013;The lure of aggregates and the pitfalls of the patriarchal perspective: a critique of the high wage economy interpretation of the British industrial revolution;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"James, John A.; McAndrews, James; Weiman, David F.";Before the formation of the Federal Reserve, banking panics were routine events in the United States. During the most severe episodes, banks in cities across the country would often suspend or restrict the par convertibility of their demand deposit liabilities. In diagnosing the causes of the Great Depression, Friedman and Schwartz famously regard these local initiatives as a second best solution, which in the absence of an effective lender of last resort would have prevented the rash of bank failures during the early 1930s and their dire monetary and real impacts. Recent research in macroeconomics though has raised the possibility that banks’ suspension of payments might also have negative real effects albeit through changes in aggregate supply such as the financing of working capital. We would expect to observe these negative shocks during the pre-Fed era, because the decentralized, private interbank payments network was especially vulnerable to systemic disruptions such as suspensions by New York and other money center banks. Reports in national trade periodicals and local newspapers during suspension periods offer many accounts of factories closing because of the inability to obtain currency for weekly payrolls and “domestic exchange” to finance internal trade. We corroborate these observations with more systematic econometric evidence at the national and regional levels. Our results show that controlling for the overall contraction and bank failures, suspension periods were associated with a statistically significant and quantitatively large decline in real activity, on the order of 10–20 %.;2013;Wall Street and Main Street: the macroeconomic consequences of New York bank suspensions, 1866–1914;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Juif, Dácil-Tania; Baten, Jörg";Not only the colonial period, but also the pre-colonial times might have influenced later development patterns. In this study we assess a potential “pre-colonial legacy” hypothesis for the case of the Andean region. In order to analyze the hypothesis, we study the human capital of Inca Indios, using age-heaping-based techniques to estimate basic numeracy skills. We find that Peruvian Inca Indios had only around half the numeracy level of the Spanish invaders. The hypothesis holds even after adjusting for a number of potential biases. In addition, we find evidence on inequality in pre-Columbian times. Given the low educational level and the high inequality reigning before the Spanish Conquest in the Andean region, we argue that more attention should be paid to the pre-colonial legacies when assessing the genesis of the long-term path of only modest economic growth in the countries of Latin America.;2013;On the human capital of Inca Indios before and after the Spanish Conquest.

"Kantor, Shawn Everett; Fishback, Price V.; WALLIS, JOHN JOSEPH";The critical election of 1932 represented a turning point in the future electoral successes of the Democrats and Republicans for over three decades. This paper seeks to measure the importance of the New Deal in facilitating the Democrats' control of the federal government well into the 1960s. We test whether long-differences in the county-level electoral support for Democratic presidential candidates after the 1930s can be attributed to New Deal interventions into local economies. We also investigate more narrowly whether voters rewarded Roosevelt from 1932 to 1936 and from 1936 to 1940 for his efforts to stimulate depressed local economies. Our instrumental variable estimates indicate that increasing a county's per capita New Deal relief and public works spending from nothing to the sample mean ($145) would have increased the long-run support for the Democratic party by 2 to 2.5 percentage points. We further find that the long-run shift toward the Democratic party after 1928 was not a function of the Roosevelt landslide victory in 1932. Roosevelt's ability to win over voters during the 1936 and 1940 elections with New Deal spending, however, did matter for the long-term.;2013;Did the New Deal solidify the 1932 Democratic realignment?;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Kitchens, Carl T.;The TVA has been applauded for its anti-malaria programs in the Southeast during the 1930s and 1940s. However, the TVA developed their anti-malaria programs because they created lakes suitable for mosquito breeding. To estimate the relationship between the TVA and malaria, I construct a county-level panel data from the Southeast United States. I find that the net effect of the TVA was to increase malaria rates following its construction. Using statistical life value estimates, I find that the hidden malaria cost of the TVA offset 24 percent of the fiscal stimulus multiplier generated by the TVA.;2013;A Dam Problem: TVA's Fight Against Malaria, 1926–1951;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Kitchens, Carl T.;"From 1900 to 1950, malaria rates declined rapidly in the southeast United States. At its peak, malaria infected over 30% of the population. Malaria declined over the period for several reasons: improvements in public infrastructure; development of new insecticides; improvements in agriculture that promoted drainage; increases in incomes; and changes in migration patterns. This paper focuses on public works constructed by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) during the 1930s and subsequent interventions during the 1940s. To estimate the relationship between these malaria programs and malaria rates, I construct a panel of annual county level malaria rates in Georgia from 1932 to 1947. Between 1932 and 1940 the malaria rate in counties that received WPA malaria projects fell from 25.9 deaths per 100,000 to 5.3 deaths per 100,000. The empirical estimates suggest that WPA malaria projects led to 9.1 fewer deaths per 100,000 or roughly 44% of the observed decline in treated counties. Additional public works constructed by the MCWA during World War II, and the introduction of DDT after 1945 completely eliminated malaria in Georgia by 1947.";2013;The effects of the Works Progress Administration's anti-malaria programs in Georgia 1932–1947;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Klemann, Hein A. M.; Schenk, Joep";Rhine transport was not an absolute condition for German industrialization. Railways proved to be efficient, and in the 1840?1870 period were essential for the industrialization of the Ruhr area. The key questions addressed in this article are: why did inland navigation not disappear from the Rhine region (as it did elsewhere), even recovering after the 1870s? And why did it have an unassailable competitive advantage from the 1890s onwards? Political developments leading to the liberalization of Rhine shipping and the canalization of the river created the opportunity to increase the scale of shipping. This gave it competitive advantages when it came to bulk transport. This article uses new data on freight rates in the Rhine delta to demonstrate the course of Rhine competitiveness. Furthermore, it identifies the institutional conditions, and the technological and organizational improvements, that were the basis of this growing competitiveness. The conclusion is that the element of German international trade that went by the Rhine correlated with the cost of Rhine shipping when compared to that of railway transport. As a consequence of the recovery of Rhine shipping, the port of Rotterdam became stronger than its Belgian neighbour, Antwerp.;2013;Competition in the Rhine delta: waterways, railways and ports, 1870–1913;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Klemp, M.; Minns, Chris; Wallis, Patrick H.; Weisdorf, Jacob L.";"How did families in pre-modern Europe structure their investments in the education and skills of their children? The dynamics of human capital formation prior to industrialization, particularly the so-called quantity–quality trade-off, have a central role in endogenous growth theories in which parents' investments in their children help generate the emergence of sustained economic growth (Galor and Weil 1999; Klemp and Weisdorf 2012). These analyses build on one of the key predictions of Becker's household economics: an inverse relationship between family size and investment in the human capital of children (Becker et al. 1960; Becker and Lewis 1973; Becker and Tomes 1979, 1986). Empirical studies of this prediction using modern data generate mixed results: some find that children in smaller families receive greater parental investments, while others report that large differences between earlier and later-born children are of greater significance (Behrman and Taubman 1986; Kessler 1991; Hanushek 1992; Black et al. 2005). Recent studies suggest that smaller family size led to greater investment in human capital formation in both pre-industrial England and elsewhere (Becker et al. 2010; Fernihough 2011; Klemp and Weisdorf 2012). Little is known about the distribution of investments in human capital between children, however.";2013;Picking winners?

Lambrecht, Thijs;Life-cycle service was one of the characteristic aspects of the European marriage pattern. The majority of the children of labourers and peasants left the households of their parents during adolescence to acquire material resources and skills in preparation for marriage. While in service, adolescents could save part of their wages. As most of them worked in close geographical proximity to their family, children in service were also a potential source of income for their parents. This article studies the nature, frequency, and value of remittances from farm servants to their parents in three countries during the eighteenth century. Important differences emerge from this comparative study. Farm servants in Belgium and France frequently supported their parents from their earnings. In contrast, English labouring households could in most cases not rely on structural assistance from their unmarried adolescent children. I argue that ownership of land is instrumental in explaining these differences. The absence of land that could be passed on by inheritance operated as a check to intergenerational solidarity.;2013;English individualism and continental altruism?

"Lampe, Markus; Sharp, Paul Richard";We argue for a new approach to examining the relationship between tariffs and growth. We demonstrate that more can be learned from time series analyses of the experience of individual countries rather than the usual panel data approach, which imposes a causal relation and presents an average coefficient for all countries. Tentative initial results using simple two-variable cointegrated VAR models suggest considerable heterogeneity in the experiences of the countries we look at. For most, however, there was a negative relationship between tariffs and levels of income for both the pre- and post-Second World War periods. However, in the second half of the twentieth century, the causality ran from income to tariffs: that is, countries simply liberalized as they got richer. Policy decisions based on the usual panel approach might thus be very inappropriate for individual countries.;2013;Tariffs and income: a time series analysis for 24 countries;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Lilja, Kristina; Bäcklund, D.";Studies have shown that children's incomes were important for working-class families during industrialization. We found that, even before industrialization, having children greatly affected the family economy of workers and master artisans. For workers, having children necessitated borrowing, but also made it easier later to pay off debts and accumulate wealth. They seem to have put into practice some sort of “saving through children”. For master artisans, running a business generally was a more important determinant of debts and assets over a lifetime, but, as adolescents, children positively affected wealth, probably because they provided cheap and flexible labour in the households and workshops.;2013;To navigate the family economy over a lifetime: life-cycle squeezes in pre-industrial Swedish towns;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Mobility rates were substantially greater than has been previously estimated, to the extent that mobility in the 1850s was only slightly less than in the 1970s. The development of mass public education in England after 1870 thus had surprisingly modest effects over the long run.

MALANIMA, PAOLO;According to Allen, between 1500 and 1750, a “great divergence” among countries in the level of wages occurred in Europe. Italian real wages were already among the lowest in the late medieval and early modern age. Their relative level diminished even more from the seventeenth century. An analysis of prices and wages in Italy and England does not support this view. Actually, until the beginning of the eighteenth century, Italian real wages were either higher than in England (fourteenth and fifteenth centuries) or more or less equal (sixteenth and seventeenth). It was not until the eighteenth century that England began to overtake Italy. However, the disparity in wages before 1800 was modest. It increased fast from then onwards.;2013;When did England overtake Italy? Medieval and early modern divergence in prices and wages;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The value (general purchasing power) of a convertible currency must be the relative cost of producing gold and other goods, which did not change significantly between 1914 and the 1930s.

In most trades premiums were small enough to allow access to apprenticeship training for youths from modest families.;2013;The price of human capital in a pre-industrial economy: Premiums and apprenticeship contracts in 18th century England;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Mitchener, Kris James; Richardson, Gary";This essay examines how the Banking Acts of the 1933 and 1935 and related New Deal legislation influenced risk taking in the financial sector of the U.S. economy. The analysis focuses on contingent liability of bank owners for losses incurred by their firms and how the elimination of this liability influenced leverage and lending by commercial banks. Using a new panel data set, we find contingent liability reduced risk taking. In states with contingent liability, banks used less leverage and converted each dollar of capital into fewer loans, and thus could survive larger loan losses (as a fraction of their portfolio) than banks in limited liability states. In states with limited liability, banks took on more leverage and risk, particularly in states that required banks with limited liability to join the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In the long run, the New Deal replaced a regime of contingent liability with deposit insurance, stricter balance sheet regulation, and increased capital requirements, shifting the onus of risk management from bankers to state and federal regulators.;2013;Does “skin in the game” reduce risk taking?

"Mitchener, Kris James; Wheelock, David C.";This paper examines the impacts of banking market structure and regulation on economic growth using new data on banking market concentration and manufacturing industry-level growth rates for U.S. states during 1899–1929—a period when the manufacturing sector was expanding rapidly and restrictive branching laws segmented the U.S. banking system geographically. Unlike studies of developing and developed countries today, we find that banking market concentration generally had a positive impact on manufacturing sector growth in the early twentieth century United States, with a somewhat stronger impact on industries with smaller establishments, lower rates of incorporation, and less reliance on bond markets (and, hence, relatively more reliance on banks). Because regulations affecting bank entry varied considerably across states and the industrial organization of the U.S. banking system differs markedly from those of other countries, we consider the impact of other aspects of banking market structure and policy on growth. Even after controlling for differences in the prevalence of branch banking, deposit insurance, and other aspects of policy and market structure, we find that market concentration boosted industrial growth.;2013;Does the structure of banking markets affect economic growth?

Participation in markets for real estate, capital, and ships was considerable, not only among middling and elite groups but also among the poor. Large households were most active in markets, incurring significantly greater debt. Poor households with a low supply of labour were relatively active, purchasing houses and ships, and incurring debts, possibly in order to cope with a lack of parental support. Middling-group households with a low supply of labour primarily sold houses and invested in the capital market, adjusting capital assets to declining labour supply at the end of their life cycle, thus creating cash rents to be able to survive old age.;2013;Preferences of the poor: market participation and asset management of poor households in sixteenth-century Holland;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Morys, Matthias;Drawing on a new data set of monthly observations, this paper investigates similarities and differences in the discount rate policy of 12 European countries under the Classical Gold Standard. It asks, in particular, whether the bank rate policy followed different patterns in core and peripheral countries. Based on OLS, ordered probit and pooled estimations of central bank discount rate behaviour, two main findings emerge: firstly, the discount rate decisions of core countries were motivated by a desire to keep the exchange-rate within the gold points. In stark contrast, the discount rate decisions of peripheral countries reflected changes in the domestic cover ratio. The main reason for the difference in behaviour was the limited effectiveness of the discount rate tool for peripheral countries, which resulted in more frequent gold point violations. Consequently, peripheral countries relied on high reserve levels and oriented their discount rate policy towards maintaining the reserve level. Secondly, interest rate decisions were influenced by Berlin and London to a similar degree, suggesting that the European branch of the Classical Gold Standard was less London-centred than had been hitherto assumed. In establishing general patterns of discount rate policy, this paper aims to contribute to the wider discussion on monetary policy under the gold standard and the core–periphery dichotomy.;2013;Discount rate policy under the Classical Gold Standard: Core versus periphery (1870s–1914);Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
MURPHY, ANNE L.;"North and Weingast's notion of ?credible commitment? arguably offers a reasonable understanding of the factors that allowed the development of a trusting relationship between the state and its potential creditors over the long term. Yet, they failed to recognize the difficulties that were encountered along the way. This article highlights some of those difficulties and shows that at times when credible commitment was in doubt, supporters of the financial revolution held the government to account through the published media and by direct action. This is important for two reasons. First, the contemporary debate regarding the financial revolution, as it is presented by some historians, may lead us to presume that there would have been little public outcry had the government reneged on its debt. Indeed, we might argue that hostility towards financiers had always made default popular with many segments of the population. Yet, clearly opinion was not quite so one-sided and the reaction against potential default was considerable. Second, the fact that the public creditors were willing to act to protect themselves shows that credible commitment was not just created from above by the Glorious Revolution and the subsequent development of the institutions of government; it was demanded from below by the people who invested in the financial revolution.";2013;Demanding ‘credible commitment’: public reactions to the failures of the early financial revolution;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
NAISMITH, RORY;A body of nearly 2,000 English finds of individual coins minted c. 973?1100 is surveyed as evidence for the scale and form of the monetary economy. A long-term view indicates that this was a period of expansion in coin use, although growth in this area remained limited compared to the later middle ages, or even the eighth century. Within the eleventh century single-finds suggest more specific developments, including a decline in coin use after the Norman Conquest, and substantial short-term fluctuations related to various economic and monetary factors. Comparison with estimates of coin production suggests a general trend for more of mints' output to enter domestic circulation after c. 1030/40, though this need not solely reflect an increase in monetization. These chronological changes are compared with the pattern of circulation within England. Overall, the kingdom enjoyed a unified currency which did not see marked localization of coin circulation. Parts of northern England were less integrated with the south, but not so far as to suggest active exclusion of non-local coin. More striking was a general trend for both production and circulation to be concentrated in the east and the south.;2013;The English monetary economy, c. 973–1100: the contribution of single-finds;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Nightingale, Pamela;The contribution of alien, particularly Italian, investment to the development of the medieval English economy has provoked opposing views which hitherto have had to rely chiefly on customs records and evidence of Italian loans to the state for statistical evidence. These, though, vary in their coverage and do not record the inland trade. This article uses the Statute Merchant certificates of debt from 1285 to analyse changing levels of commercial investment by alien and denizen merchants throughout all areas of the kingdom. It shows that Italian investment was declining from the 1280s in line with falling imports of foreign silver. It discusses the causes of this decline, and the effect on alien and denizen credit of imports of counterfeit sterling coins produced by European mints. It relates these financial developments in England, France, and Flanders to the sequence of events which led to English merchants increasing their numbers and mercantile capital at the beginning of the fourteenth century when they were first able to establish their domination of the country's export trade in wool.;2013;Alien finance and the development of the English economy, 1285–1311;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

O'DAY, ROSEMARY;"The focus of this article is on the contribution of an early eighteenth-century aristocratic marriage partnership to the family economy, and particularly to the non-co-resident, extended family. Through a study of the first duke and duchess of Chandos, the active involvement of a husband and wife in furthering the marriages of close kin is highlighted. By outlining the strategy and tactics adopted and discussing their motivation, the article challenges the view that kinship had seriously declined in importance by the early eighteenth century. The Brydgeses did more than broker marriages for close female relatives; they groomed the young women, helped build up and manage their portions using new and modern forms of making money such as investing in the stock market, and found them husbands. The marriages of these young women were a form of patronage. Motivation for this involvement included familial affection and responsibility but extended to increasing and consolidating the duke's socio-political influence through the patronage system and to limiting the potential drain on his estate. The duchess had a vested interest in this: it raised her status within family, connection, and society. The young women concerned, and their parents, were not always grateful for this patronage.";2013;Matchmaking and moneymaking in a patronage society: the first duke and duchess of Chandos, c. 1712–35;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Ojala, Jari; Pehkonen, Jaakko; ELORANTA, JARI";Ship jumping in foreign ports was widespread throughout the age of sail. Desertion by seamen was illegal, it occurred abroad, and men who deserted only seldom returned home. We analyse desertion quantitatively and link it to the broader question of quit behaviour and labour turnover. Though the better wages paid at the foreign ports were the main reason for desertion, the regression model of the determinants of desertion indicates that outside opportunities, such as migration, and monetary incentives played a significant role in the nineteenth-century labour market, characterized by rather strict control over labour supply, working conditions, and terms of trade.;2013;Desertions in nineteenth-century shipping: modelling quit behaviour;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Owen, Thomas C.;Newly available data on Russian commerce, industry, finance, incorporations, labour, and investment allow a fresh approach to two historical puzzles: the dating of cyclical peaks and troughs in Russia during the six decades before the First World War and the evaluation of theories advanced to explain the causes of these cycles. A diffusion index and a composite index establish the dates and amplitudes of seven complete cycles from 1855 to 1909 and part of an eighth, in 1910?13, interrupted by the First World War. The influence of wars and the Revolution of 1905 on the Russian cycle is clear. A comparison of diffusion indices for Russia and Germany reveals that Russian cycles occasionally diverged from the European pattern in the absence of war and revolution, notably during the industrial boom of the 1890s. The new findings give qualified support to the contention of several Soviet economists in the 1920s that this divergence resulted, at least in part, from the monetary stimulus of exports, primarily of grain.;2013;Measuring business cycles in the Russian Empire;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Panza, Laura;The Near East underwent a process of integration with the global economy during the second half of the nineteenth century. This article explores one aspect of this process, examining the linkages established between the cotton industries in Egypt and Western Anatolia, and the international cotton market during the first wave of globalization. We undertake a quantitative exploration of the pattern of price transmission between the Near East and the international cotton markets over this period, connecting changes in the nature of spatial market integration to major economic and political developments.;2013;Globalization and the Near East: A Study of Cotton Market Integration in Egypt and Western Anatolia;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
PAUL, K. TAWNY;This article draws on cases of public insult from the Edinburgh consistory court to explore constructions of credit and reputation during the eighteenth century. Scotland's unique legal context offers new insights into the honour of men and women, replacing the received view that female honour was almost entirely about sexual honour and complicating our understanding of male honour among the middling sort. In contrast to studies that view the credit of men and women as principally contradictory, this study instead identifies significant points of both overlap and divergence in male and female reputation and discusses honour as a family matter. Unlike in England, levels of defamation litigation in Scotland remained high through the eighteenth century, and both the social composition of defamation litigants and the types of insult they brought to court remained consistent. However, the forms and settings of disputes over honour changed, reflecting the interiorization of conflict as the eighteenth century progressed.;2013;Credit, reputation, and masculinity in British urban commerce: Edinburgh, c. 1710–70;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Ploeckl, Florian;Tariffs can affect the growth of states. But how do they affect regional growth within states? Using Baden's 1836 entry into the Zollverein, the customs union of German states, I investigate the internal impact of a change in tariffs. With a new data set of regional employment data I demonstrate that the Zollverein had a substantial positive effect. Two market access effects are shown, one follows the standard market access predictions and the second triggers the direct investment by Swiss entrepreneurs in German regions close to their home base. Furthermore occupational change within the crafts sector was shifting labour towards higher taxed occupations and towards the region close to Switzerland.;2013;"The internal impact of a customs union; Baden and the Zollverein";Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Prados De La Escosura, Leandro;Long-run trends in Africa's wellbeing are provided on the basis of a new index of human development, alternative to the UNDP's HDI. A long-run improvement in African human development is found that it falls short of those experienced in other developing regions. A closer look at Africa reveals the distinctive behaviour north and south of the Sahara, with Sub-Saharan Africa falling behind other developing regions and North Africa catching up. Education has been human development's driving force over time. Since the late 1980s, stagnating life expectancy largely due to the spread of HIV/AIDS and the arresting effect of economic mismanagement and political turmoil on growth, help to explain Africa's falling behind. Human development advancement since the mid-twentieth century is positively associated to being a coastal and resource-rich country and negatively to political–economic distortions. The large country variance of the recovery during the last decade suggests being cautious about the future's prospects.;2013;Human development in Africa: A long-run perspective;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Pritchett, Jonathan B.; Smith, Mallorie";When imported slaves were first sold in New Orleans, buyers were unaware of the slaves’ unobservable characteristics. In time, the new owners learned more about their slaves and may have resold the “lemons.” Previous research suggests that buyers anticipated such adverse selection and reduced their bids for these slaves. Consequently, we should observe lower prices for resold slaves. We test this proposition by linking the sequential sales records of 568 slaves. Through a comparison of initial and resale prices, we find little evidence to support the hypothesis that adverse selection lowered the price of resold slaves.;2013;Sequential Sales as a Test of Adverse Selection in the Market for Slaves;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Raff, Daniel; Wachter, Susan; Yan, Se";This paper provides the first estimates of housing price movements for Beijing in late pre-modern China. We hand-collect from archival sources transaction prices and other house attribute information from the 498 surviving house sale contracts for Beijing during the first two centuries of the Qing Dynasty (1644–1840), a long period without major wars, political turmoil, or significant institutional change in the Chinese capital. We use hedonic methods to construct a real estate price index for Beijing for the period. The regression analysis explains a major proportion of the variance of housing prices. We find that house prices grew steadily for the first half-century of the Qing Dynasty and declined afterwards in both nominal and real terms through the late eighteenth century. Nominal prices grew starting in the late eighteenth century and declined from the early nineteenth century through 1840. But these price changes occurred with contemporaneous price changes in basic measures of the cost of living: there was little change in real terms to the end of our period.;2013;Real estate prices in Beijing, 1644 to 1840;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Rei, Claudia;The Portuguese and Dutch merchant empires had a similar geographic distribution with outposts all around the Indian Ocean, which they controlled and manned. Both empires faced the same problem of monitoring their agents in remote corners of the world. Each, however, arrived at a different solution to the monitoring problem. I use a principal–agent model to link different monitoring options to the different organizational structures of the two empires.

"Ristuccia, Cristiano Andrea; TOOZE, ADAM";This article anatomizes the ?productivity race? between Nazi Germany and the US over the period from the Great Depression to the Second World War in the metalworking industry. We present novel data that allow us to account for both the quantity of installed machine tools and their technological type. Hitherto, comparison of productive technologies has been limited to case studies and well-worn narratives about US mass production and European-style flexible specialization. Our data show that the two countries in fact employed similar types of machines combined in different ratios. Furthermore, neither country was locked in a rigid technological paradigm. By 1945 Germany had converged on the US both in terms of capital-intensity and the specific technologies employed. Capital investment made a greater contribution to output growth in Germany, whereas US growth was capital-saving. Total factor productivity growth made a substantial contribution to the armaments boom in both countries. But it was US industry, spared the war's most disruptive effects, that was in a position to take fullest advantage of the opportunities for wartime productivity growth. This adds a new element to familiar explanations for Germany's rapid catch-up after 1945.;2013;Machine tools and mass production in the armaments boom: Germany and the United States, 1929–44;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Rose, Jonathan D.; Snowden, Kenneth A.";The fully amortized mortgage loan contract is an important instance of financial innovation in the U.S. residential mortgage market. We examine the adoption of this contract from the 1880s to the 1930s by building and loan (B&L) associations, the nation's most important institutional home mortgage lenders at the time. A chain of complementary innovations by B&Ls gradually reduced the costs of adopting amortization, supporting moderate use by the 1920s. During the crisis of the 1930s, the poor performance of the traditional B&L loan contract radically increased the benefit of adoption, as borrowers demanded the new contract. The adoption examined here occurred primarily in the conventional loan market because B&Ls, unlike other lenders, generally avoided the use of the new Federal Housing Administration insurance program. The New Deal may have had more impact through new federal savings and loan charters, which incorporated many of the complementary innovations that supported the new form of lending.;2013;The New Deal and the origins of the modern American real estate loan contract;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Rota, Mauro;The credit system in the growth process of post-World War II Italy has often been dismissed as a waste of money or ancillary to industrialization at best. This paper provides evidence of both an industrialization strategy driven by credit deepening and the beneficial role played by credit systems in growth. By using a new data set of long-run loans to industrial manufacturing sectors, broken down by area, we find in the long run a strong and positive effect of credit deepening on the value added per worker in the Italian economy during the Golden Age (1955–1970).;2013;Credit and growth: reconsidering Italian industrial policy during the Golden Age;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Sánchez-Alonso, Blanca;The aim of this article is to disentangle the different forces that shaped Argentinian immigration policy from 1870 to 1930. A new index of immigration policy is presented, showing how immigration restrictions increased over time but, in contrast with the US, Argentina remained open to mass migration until the 1930s. The quantitative evidence presented here suggests that there were economic reasons to restrict immigration prior to the 1930s, namely rising inequality, the closing of the frontier, and the declining relative quality of immigrants. A political economy interpretation helps to understand the long-run evolution of immigration policy. Labour interests could not be translated into Parliament in a direct way. A large share of workers did not have the right to vote simply because they were foreigners. Inequality influenced immigration policy through social unrest since those negatively affected by massive immigration developed alternative actions: general strikes, labour unrest, and violence. Contrary to what economic theory would have predicted, anti-immigration legislation came from Argentinian capital and landowners who feared political and social unrest.;2013;Making sense of immigration policy: Argentina, 1870–1930;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"SANDVIK, P. THONSTADÅ.L.; STORLI, ESPEN";In 1930, Unilever tried to take control of Lilleborg, Norway's most important producer of soap and vegetable oil, with the aim of wiping out most of Norway's independent margarine and soap industry. However, as the purchase was dependent on government concession, Unilever became embroiled in a power struggle with the Norwegian political authorities. The company was strongly criticized by Norwegian nationalists. The question of whether or not to let Unilever go forward became one of the most contested questions in Norwegian politics in the period. In the end, Unilever was allowed to go ahead with the purchase, but in return the company was forced to make substantial concessions. Expanding on Jones's framework for understanding the balance of power between multinationals and host governments, in this article it is argued that we must look beyond firm specific assets and a cost-benefit oriented analysis of the relationship between multinationals and host countries to understand the end result. In this case, nationalism had a decisive impact. Unilever's acquisition of Lilleborg and the Norwegian response thus contributes to our understanding of the nature of multinational enterprise in the interwar period and of the political economy of foreign direct investment in general.;2013;Big business and small states: Unilever and Norway in the interwar years;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Santiago Caballero, Carlos;From an extensive data set of wheat yields at municipal level in mid-eighteenth-century Spain, a detailed statistical analysis indicates that the differences in wheat yields were mainly a consequence of different natural conditions, and that demand did not have a significant influence. Counterfactual exercises show that improvements in rainfall, altitude, or roughness of terrain would have a significant impact on average yields. The paper concludes that producers addressed the growing demand not by investing in increasing yields, but by extending the area of cultivated land, using the still abundant pastures. The low grain yields in Spain were in part a consequence of the rational behaviour of producers who faced an economic environment characterized by an elastic supply of land.;2013;The Rain in Spain?

SAPOZNIK, ALEXANDRA;Agriculture was the largest and most important sector of the medieval English economy. Yet although peasants comprised the majority of the population, and were responsible for the greater part of land use, surprisingly little is known about peasant cropping patterns and production strategies. Taking the Crowland Abbey manor of Oakington, Cambridgeshire as a case study, this article examines peasant land use and agricultural strategies. Using data collected from the Oakington tithe accounts and manor court rolls, this article demonstrates that peasants used their land more extensively than did the lord, raising their output per acre above that of the demesne. This was driven by peasant need for fodder crops, and the strain placed on agricultural systems that required peasants to use their land to produce grains and legumes for consumption, fodder, and sale.;2013;The productivity of peasant agriculture: Oakington, Cambridgeshire, 1360–99;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Scherner, Jonas;Today, most scholars agree that Nazi Germany did not follow a premeditated Blitzkrieg strategy in the late 1930s and at the beginning of the Second World War. However, the question of the extent to which Germany's economy had been prepared for a longer war is still debated because statistical information on Germany's investment pattern is fragmentary and data on the structure of prewar German military expenditure are not available. Relying on newly discovered sources, this article closes these gaps. The Nazi regime clearly shifted its investment towards preparation for war from the mid-1930s on, and though armaments purchases stagnated during the period from 1937 to 1939, investment in munitions industries grew considerably. Consequently, during the late 1930s the Nazis pursued a ?sustainable? rearmament strategy necessary for fighting a longer war. Yet, despite massive capacity enlargements in the munitions industries, total German investment was not unusually high by today's definition because contemporary figures included a significant amount of armaments purchases.;2013;‘Armament in depth’ or ‘armament in breadth’?

Schneider, Eric B.;This paper adjusts reconstructions of per capita food consumption in England from the eighteenth to twentieth centuries by factoring in the energy costs of digestion, pregnancy, and lactation. Digestion costs arise because the body has difficulty digesting certain components of food. Incorporating digestion costs reduced the calories available per capita by 12.7 per cent in 1700 but only by 4.9 per cent in 1909 because of changes in diet. The energy costs of pregnancy and lactation were lower only reducing calorie consumption by 2.5 per cent. These adjustments suggest a more pessimistic level of calorie availability before the twentieth century.;2013;Inescapable hunger?

Schneider, Eric B.;This paper uses demographic data drawn from Wrigley et al.'s (1997) family reconstitutions of 26 English parishes to adjust Allen's (2001) real wages to the changing demography of early modern England. Using parity progression ratios (a fertility measure) and age specific mortality for children and parents, model families are predicted in two reference periods 1650–1700 and 1750–1800. These models yield two levels of interesting results. At the individual family level, we can measure how different families' real wages changed over the family life cycle as additional children were born. At the aggregate level, we can predict thousands of families using Monte Carlo simulation, creating a realistic distribution of median family real wages in the economy. There are two main findings. First, pregnancy and lactation do not create cyclical effects in the family's income. Instead, most families' welfare ratios decline steadily across the family life cycle until children begin to leave the household, increasing the welfare ratios. Second, Allen's real wages understate or match the median of the predicted demography-adjusted distributions.;2013;Real wages and the family: Adjusting real wages to changing demography in pre-modern England;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

It is shown that, within position, women were substitutes for younger men, but not for senior men. In addition, the employment of women in routine positions allowed the bank to expand its branch network, creating new higher-level positions, which were almost always filled by men.";2013;The impact of female employment on male salaries and careers: evidence from the English banking industry, 1890–1941;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Sharp, Buchanan;This article contains the first systematic discussion of Edward II's response to the famine of 1315?17, the most severe of the middle ages. While there had been earlier famines, that of 1315?17 produced the earliest surviving evidence of official attempts at remedial actions. Those included the enforcement of traditional regulatory measures such as the assizes of ale and weights and measures, and efforts to regulate brewing by preventing the use of wheat and limiting the amount of barley used. In addition, the government acted to encourage the import of grain and imposed prohibitions on export that were explicitly justified by scarcity and high prices. English bishops were urged to encourage those who were hoarding grain to hold only enough for themselves and their families and sell the rest. While it is unclear whether government actions had much effect, it is difficult to imagine under fourteenth-century conditions that any government had the means or measures to respond effectively to famine. Nonetheless, some of the measures taken by Edward II's government, especially export prohibition and attempts to persuade or compel those with supplies of grain to sell it, had a long future ahead of them.;2013;Royal paternalism and the moral economy in the reign of Edward II: the response to the Great Famine;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Sharp, Paul Richard; Weisdorf, Jacob L.";We take up again the famous case of the trade in wheat between the United States and the United Kingdom. This is often used to illustrate the so-called first era of globalization at the end of the nineteenth century. This study, however, finds evidence of transatlantic commodity market integration already during the eighteenth century. Using price data for wheat in America and Britain, our findings support both that price differentials were quite small for many years, and that prices adjusted to the law-of-one-price equilibrium. This process was, however, continuously being interrupted by ‘exogenous’ events, such as trade policy, war and politics. In particular, the French and Napoleonic wars and the subsequent high levels of protection in the UK meant that markets were almost always disintegrated until the repeal of the British Corn Laws in 1846.;2013;Globalization revisited: Market integration and the wheat trade between North America and Britain from the eighteenth century;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Shester, Katharine L.;Between 1933 and 1973 the federal government funded the construction of over 1 million units of low-rent housing.

However, I find no negative effects of public housing in 1950 or 1960, implying that long-run negative effects only became apparent in the 1960s.

Solar, Peter M.;Shipping costs between Europe and Asia were reduced by two-thirds between the 1770s and the 1820s. Copper sheathing and other technical improvements which allowed ships to make more frequent voyages over longer lifetimes accounted for part of the cost reduction. British hegemony in the Indian Ocean, which ended an eighteenth-century arms race, accounted for the rest by allowing the substitution of smaller ships which cost less to build and required fewer men per ton. These changes were at least as important as the elimination of monopoly profits in narrowing intercontinental price differentials during the early nineteenth century.;2013;Opening to the East: Shipping Between Europe and Asia, 1770–1830;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Steckel, Richard H.; Ziebarth, Nicolas L.";"We analyze all slave manifests housed at the National Archives—some 24,400 documents involving approximately 135,000 slaves who were transported in the coastwise trade from 1810 to 1861. The manifests list the name of the owner or shipper, which allows us to match names with traders found in other sources. We also utilize demographic characteristics of the manifests to estimate the probability that a trader organized the shipment. Commercial transactions increased over the antebellum period, and on average were responsible for approximately 55 percent of slaves who migrated from Atlantic to Gulf coast ports.

With new data on selective immigration during the era of mass migrations at the end of the nineteenth century, we show that human capital endowment of international migrants can induce effects on economic development that persist until today. According to our estimations, the effect of selective immigration on real GDP per capita in the year 2000 is significant and equals around US$75 overall. As a reference, this value equals the amount poor Brazilians get to supplement their subsistence in the “Fome Zero” (Zero Hunger) program.

In a panel analysis of 12 countries, we find that delay in human-capital formation was the chief factor hindering any improvement in the biological standard of living in Portugal.;2013;Portuguese living standards, 1720–1980, in European comparison: heights, income, and human capital;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Taylor, Jason E.; Neumann, Todd C.";Markets during the New Deal operated under a number of different institutional regimes, which were marked by executive orders, the passage of various pieces of legislation, and Supreme Court rulings on their constitutionality. Specifically, we break the New Deal period into the following six regimes: the Hundred Days, the President's Reemployment Agreement, the National Recovery Administration Codes of Fair Competition, the Schechter era, the National Labor Relations Act, and the Fair Labor Standards Act. Under these various regimes industrial markets were subject to different regulations relating to hourly wage rates, hours of work, the nature of competition, and unionization. Vector Autoregressive (VAR) regressions are run using a monthly panel of employment, weekly hours worked, wage rates, prices, and output for 11 major industries. We find that key policy and legal changes were associated with large and statistically significant movements in economic variables. Furthermore, changes in institutional regimes impacted different types of industries unevenly. For example, low-wage industries saw the largest increases in wages, and drops in output, after the mandated wage increases in 1933.;2013;The effect of institutional regime change within the new deal on industrial output and labor markets;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Thompson, S. J.;The imposition of the world's first modern income tax in 1799 prompted a revival of interest in national accounting. This article examines the extent to which William Pitt the Younger, who proposed the new tax, modelled his estimates of national wealth on those produced a century earlier by the pioneers in this field, Sir William Petty, Charles Davenant, and Gregory King. In addition, the calculations of Benjamin Bell and Henry Beeke, two of Pitt's contemporaries, are analysed in detail to highlight the fragility of these contemporary estimates of national income. This analysis has important implications for economic historians who have used this material to try to establish the structure and growth of national output. National accountants during the long eighteenth century were not, for the most part, concerned with structural change. Rather, their descriptions of economic structure should be understood as reflecting a particular set of a priori claims about what they deemed to be the proper mode and distribution of taxation.;2013;The first income tax, political arithmetic, and the measurement of economic growth;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

As suggested by NEG literature, our results support the hypothesis of a relationship between wages and regional market access and show the change in the regional wage structure following the gradual closing of the Spanish economy and of Spain’s trade partners, as a result of the increasing importance of the domestic market. We find evidence of the existence of a regional wage gradient centred on Barcelona which weakened during these years.

Configuring financial markets in preindustrial Europe was thus not a uniform process leading to one ideal-type market structure. The development of markets with advanced financial institutions did not naturally produce liquid markets.

Vollrath, Dietrich;This paper examines the relationship of inequality to school funding in counties of the U.S. in 1890. Inequality, measured here on the basis of farm-size distributions, is found to be negatively related to local school property tax revenues across the whole sample of 1345 rural counties. However, further analysis shows that this relationship is not consistent across the sample. In the North, there is a significant negative relationship between inequality and school funding, and this relationship is shown to be consistent with the fact that assessed values of property did not rise linearly with wealth. Across the South, there is no distinct relationship between inequality and school funding. The results also indicate that inequality in the South cannot directly explain the gap in school funding with the North, in the sense that redistributing farms in the South to match the Northern distributions leads to no predicted increase in school funding.;2013;Inequality and school funding in the rural United States, 1890;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

ZAHEDIEH, NUALA;Between 1680 and 1730 the English and Welsh copper industry rose from the dead and by the mid-eighteenth century it had become Europe's leading copper producer. The revival followed the extension of sugar cultivation in England's colonies and the creation of a strong new demand for copper, which was reflected in rising exports and rising prices. Buoyant demand created a favourable market for the inventive activity needed to cut costs in the native industry, which encouraged investment in a systematic programme of research and development and culminated in important breakthroughs in smelting and mining technologies which transformed the non-ferrous metal industries. The story provides an insight into how the economic context shaped the way useful knowledge was produced and consumed. Colonial expansion not only provided England with additional resources overseas but also encouraged the reallocation of human and financial capital to make better use of slack resources at home. Empire and technical change intersected with positive consequences for economic growth.;2013;Colonies, copper, and the market for inventive activity in England and Wales, 1680–1730;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Zehetmayer, Matthias;This study analyzes trends and determinants of the height of men born in the 100 largest American urban areas during the second half of the nineteenth century and compares them with heights of the rural population. In this sample of 21,704 US Army recruits, there is an urban height penalty of up to 0.58 in. (1.5 cm). An increment in urban population of 100,000 is associated with a height decrease of about 0.31 in. (0.8 cm). Urban heights declined after 1855 followed by stagnation until the early 1890s, whereas rural heights stagnated from the late 1840s until 1885. Urban recruits from the northeast were 0.46 in. (1.2 cm) shorter than urban Midwestern recruits. There is some evidence of a height convergence between large and small cities toward the end of the century and of an inverted U-shaped relationship between height and city size. Urban heights were positively correlated with the extent of the railroad network, the real wage rate in the manufacturing sector, and high socioeconomic status, while they were negatively correlated with the death rate, and the percentage of the city’s population employed in manufacturing.;2013;Health, market integration, and the urban height penalty in the US, 1847–1894;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Zeitz, Peter;This article analyzes the impact of employment institutions on Japanese-, British-, and Chinese-owned textile firms in China during the 1920s and 1930s. Despite Britain's domestic position as a world productivity leader, Japanese firms enjoyed a 70 percent productivity advantage over both British and Chinese competitors. The divergent performance of Japanese and British investments in China is explained by differences in management practice. Japanese firms had domestic experience with employment institutions similar to China's and applied labor management strategies that functioned well under these institutions. British firms lacked the institutional experience necessary to adapt management strategies to Chinese institutions.;2013;Do Local Institutions Affect All Foreign Investors in the Same Way?

"Zuijderduijn, Jaco; Moor, T. de";In the past one of the main challenges to households was that of coping with adversity. War, plague, famine, and flood were a constant threat, and could reduce what little improvements families had made in productivity. Economic growth therefore required a means of absorbing external adversities. To see how well late medieval households coped with adversity, this investigation focuses on the households of a small town and its surroundings in early modern Holland. Our findings reveal that several severe external shocks around 1500 had little effect on the general level or distribution of wealth, which suggests that certain forms of insurance may have protected the population. The results show that households increasingly invested in capital markets rather than employing such techniques as scattered holdings and hoarding. This fact indicates that such investment played a vital role in a household's risk aversion strategy. The change from unproductive to more productive risk-aversion strategies also provides some clues about progress with respect to insurance during Holland's financial revolution.;2013;Spending, saving, or investing?

Allen, Robert C.;The causes of the United States’ exceptional economic performance are investigated by comparing American wages and prices with wages and prices in Great Britain, Egypt, and India. American industrialization in the nineteenth century required tariff protection since the country's comparative advantage lay in agriculture. After 1895 surging American productivity shifted the country's comparative advantage to manufacturing. Egypt and India could not have industrialized by following American policies since their wages were so low and their energy costs so high that the modern technology that was cost effective in Britain and the United States would not have paid in their circumstances.;2014;American Exceptionalism as a Problem in Global History;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Alvarez-Nogal, Carlos; Chamley, Christophe";Under Philip II, Castile was the first country with a large nation-wide domestic public debt. A new view of that fiscal system is presented that is potentially relevant for other fiscal systems in Europe before 1800. The credibility of the debt, mostly in perpetual redeemable annuities, was enhanced by decentralized funding through taxes administered by cities making up the Realm in the Cortes. The accumulation of short-term debt depended on refinancing through long-term debt. Financial crises in the short-term debt occurred when the service of the long-term debt reached the revenues of its servicing taxes. They were not caused by liquidity crises and were resolved after protracted negotiations in the Cortes by tax increases and interest rate reductions.;2014;Debt policy under constraints: Philip II, the Cortes, and Genoese bankers;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Andrés Ucendo, J. I.; Lanza García, R.";This article focuses on the evolution of real wages earned by building labourers and craftsmen in Madrid during the seventeenth century. After a substantial rise brought about by the arrival of the Court in 1561, real wages experienced a remarkable fall from 1621?30 onwards. Our thesis is that the fiscal and monetary policies pursued by the Crown to fund its ambitious imperial policy exerted a clear influence on this decline. The currency manipulations of the low-value petty coin (maravedí) drove serious losses in the real wages of building labourers and craftsmen between 1621 and 1680. In the years around 1665 the real wages of both groups had fallen below the levels of 1561?1600, and the indirect taxes levied by the Crown and the town council contributed to keeping real wages stagnant at around the low levels of 1665?80 between 1681 and 1700. Although this issue merits further research, it seems unlikely that building labourers and craftsmen could have offset the decline in their real wages through an increase in the number of hours worked or a rise in the number of work days.;2014;Prices and real wages in seventeenth-century Madrid;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Based on portfolio sorts and Fama–MacBeth regressions, we find no relationship between market beta, size or total risk and average returns. Momentum is strongly present in the entire data set as well as in subsamples based on size. We also find evidence for a weak value effect as measured by dividend yield.

"Ardeni, Pier Giorgio; Gentili, Andrea";Among the various statistical studies on migration before the Great War, Italy has received little attention, with a few notable exceptions. The standard economic approach explains emigration to any given country as driven by relative wages, relative employment rates, and the stock of previous emigrants to that country, the “network”. This paper improves on earlier contributions by covering all Italian migration outflows between 1876 and 1915 to the most significant destination countries, taking all countries separately and simultaneously and adopting the most consistent and up-to-date econometric approaches. As it turns out, the standard model is only partially confirmed when accounting for heterogeneity of destinations, whereas other relevant hypotheses are not accepted.;2014;Revisiting Italian emigration before the Great War: a test of the standard economic model;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Atack, Jeremy; Jaremski, Matthew; Rousseau, Peter L.";Studies have shown a connection between finance and growth, but most do not consider how financial and real factors interact to put a virtuous cycle of economic development into motion. As the main transportation advance of the nineteenth century, railroads connected established commercial centers and made unsettled areas along their routes better candidates for development. We measure the strength of links between railroads and banks in seven Midwest states using an annual transportation geographic information system (GIS) database linked to a census of banking. These data indicate that those counties that already had a bank were more likely to see their first railroad go through over the next decade, while new banks tended to enter a county a year or two after a railroad was built. The initial banking system thus helped establish the rail system, while the rapid expansion of railroads helped fill in the banking map of the American Midwest.;2014;American Banking and the Transportation Revolution before the Civil War;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
AUSTIN, GARETH;Through a case study of cocoa-farming in Ghana, this article takes up the long-running but recently neglected debate about the ?cash crop revolution? in tropical Africa during the early colonial period. It focuses on the supply side, to test the much criticized but never superseded ?vent-for-surplus? interpretation of the export expansion as a substitution of labour for leisure. The article argues that while the model captured certain features of the case, such as the application of labour to underused land, its defining claim about labour is without empirical foundation. Rather, the evidence points to a reallocation of resources from existing market activities towards the adoption of an exotic crop, entailing a shift towards a new, qualitatively different and more profitable kind of production function. This innovation is best understood in the context of the long-term search of African producers for ways of realizing the economic potential of their resource of relatively abundant land, while ameliorating the constraints which the environment put upon its use.;2014;Vent for surplus or productivity breakthrough?

"Badia-Miró, Marc; Tello, Enric";We present a model of vine-growing specialization that explains the key agricultural change carried out before and throughout the Catalan industrialization. The results confirm the role played by a “Smithian” market-pull force exerted from the Atlantic demand, together with the “Boserupian” population-push on land-use intensification. They jointly put in motion a process of opening and closing of an inner frontier of vineyard planting, whose local impact was conditioned by the agro-ecological endowments as well as to the different levels and trends of income inequality. Vineyard planting gave rise to less inequality up to the 1820s, but it grew again afterwards.;2014;Vine-growing in Catalonia: the main agricultural change underlying the earliest industrialization in Mediterranean Europe (1720–1939);European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Bai, Ying; KUNG, JAMES KAI-SING";By providing more public goods (irrigation), collective agriculture can deal with negative weather shocks more effectively. Yet, collective institutions are fraught with problems of work incentives, excessive grain procurement, and the like, which in one extreme historical instance had resulted in great tragedy—China's Great Leap Famine. By exploiting the variation in the pace of agricultural decollectivization among the Chinese provinces during 1978–1984, we test the respective effects of weather shocks, the lasting impact of the Great Leap Famine, and public goods provision on the villages' institutional choice between collective and family farming. We find that bad weather at the time of decollectivization had the likely effect of strengthening the collectives, but that effect reverses in provinces that had experienced greater famine severity or had enjoyed better public goods provision.;2014;The shaping of an institutional choice: Weather shocks, the Great Leap Famine, and agricultural decollectivization in China;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Using newly assembled state- and county-level data, the results show that the Johnson administration directed funding in ways consistent with the War on Poverty's rhetoric of fighting poverty and racial discrimination: poorer areas and those with a greater share of nonwhite residents received systematically more funding. In contrast to New Deal spending, political variables explain very little of the variation in EOA funding.

It focuses on the unusually well-documented relationship between Henry III, King of England between 1216 and 1272, and Flemish merchants from the towns of Douai and Ypres, who provided cloth on credit to the royal wardrobe. From the surviving royal documents, we reconstruct the credit advanced to the royal wardrobe by the merchants of Ypres and Douai for each year between 1247 and 1270, together with the king's repayment history. The interactions between the king and the merchants are then analysed. The insights from this analysis are applied to the historical data to explain the trading decisions made by the merchants during this period, as well as why the strategies of the Yprois sometimes differed from those of the Douaissiens.;2014;The credit relationship between Henry III and merchants of Douai and Ypres, 1247–70;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Bignon, V.; Flandreau, Marc";Measurement of the value of “media capture” (the control of newspapers by business or political interests) is difficult. However, if capture is valuable, it should affect the price of newspaper shares. Useful information about the value of media capture should be retrievable from Stock Exchange data. Interwar France provides a unique setting to implement this idea because key newspapers floated voting and nonvoting stocks. Combined with takeover prices, data yield estimates of the price of media capture and of the time-series evolution of this price.

"Bonis, Riccardo de; Silvestrini, Andrea";n this paper, we investigate the main features of the Italian financial cycle, extracted by means of a structural trend-cycle decomposition of the credit-to-GDP ratio, using annual observations from 1861 to 2011. In order to draw conclusions based on solid historical data, we provide a thorough reconstruction of the key balance sheet time series of Italian banks, considering all the main assets and liabilities over the last 150 years. We come to three main conclusions. First, while there was close correlation between loans and deposits (relative to GDP) until the mid-1970s, over the last 30 years, this link became more tenuous and the volume of loans has increased in relation to deposits. The banks covered this “funding gap” mainly by issuing new debt securities. Second, the Italian financial cycle has a much longer duration than traditional business cycles. Third, taking into account the deviation of the credit-to-GDP ratio from its trend, an acceleration of credit preceded or accompanied a banking crisis in 8 out of the 12 episodes listed by Reinhart and Rogoff (This time is different: eight centuries of financial folly. Princeton University Press, Princeton, 2009). A Logit regression confirms a positive association between the probability of a banking crisis and a previous acceleration of the credit-to-GDP gap. However, there were also periods—such as the early 1970s—in which the growth of the credit-to-GDP ratio was not followed by a banking crisis.;2014;The Italian financial cycle: 1861–2011;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Bottomley, Sean;There are two competing accounts for explaining Britain's technological transformation during the Industrial Revolution. One sees it as the inevitable outcome of a largely exogenous increase in the supply of new ideas and ways of thinking. The other sees it as a demand side response to economic incentives—that in Britain, it paid to invent the technology of the Industrial Revolution. However, this second interpretation relies on the assumption that inventors were sufficiently responsive to new commercial opportunities. This paper tests this assumption, using a new dataset of Scottish and Irish patents. It finds that the propensity of inventors to extend patent protection into Scotland and/or Ireland was indeed closely correlated with the relative market opportunity of the patented invention.;2014;Patenting in England, Scotland and Ireland during the Industrial Revolution, 1700–1852;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Expellees were not selected on the basis of skills or labor market prospects and, as ethnic Germans, were close substitutes to native West Germans. Expellee inflows substantially reduced native employment.

Brown, A. T.;"This article explores how far estate management and institutional constraints help to explain the transformations of rural society in England from the fourteenth to the seventeenth centuries. The monks of Durham Cathedral Priory and the bishops of Durham faced many of the same exogenous pressures in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries but they responded differently to these challenges. By the seventeenth century all of the dean and chapter's lands were consolidated holdings on 21-year leases, whereas a confused mixture of copyhold and leasehold land had developed on the bishops' estate. This had a significant impact upon the challenges and opportunities facing their tenants. Institutional constraints were often crucial factors in the transformation of the English countryside: these two neighbouring ecclesiastical estates faced broadly the same problems and yet the composition of their estates diverged significantly across this period, having a profound effect not only on levels of rent, but also on the tenure of holdings and ultimately their relative size; three of the most important factors in the formation of agrarian capitalism. This article also argues that how rural society adapted to the fifteenth-century recession greatly affected the ability of their sixteenth-century counterparts to respond to inflation.";2014;Estate management and institutional constraints in pre-industrial England: the ecclesiastical estates of Durham, c. 1400–1640;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Price variation decomposes into: (i) magnitude of price shocks; (ii) correlation of price shocks; (iii) between-period arbitrage. Data frequency affects these components, but has the largest effect on between-period arbitrage, commonly measured by half-life. Since this measure has been generally employed, previous analyses should be interpreted with caution. We further show that estimated effects of better transport and communication depend on the model used to measure market integration. Notably, we observe market integration improvements, not in between-period arbitrage, but in the within-week behaviour of prices (i.e. over much shorter time periods). So transport impacted English market integration, but in a way not captured by half-lives.";2014;Measuring integration in the English wheat market, 1770–1820: New methods, new answers;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The constitutional representation of creditors may have meant significant markups for republican oligarchs.

In Ireland they were almost wiped out by the early 1920s, while in the Netherlands they proved to be a long-lasting institutional transplant. Raiffeisen banks were successful in the Netherlands because they operated in niche markets with few competitors, while rural financial markets in Ireland were unsegmented and populated by long-established incumbents, leaving little room for new players, whatever their institutional advantages.

"Cook, Lisa D.; Logan, Trevon D.; Parman, John M.";We document the existence of a distinctive national naming pattern for African Americans in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. We use census records to identify a set of high-frequency names among African Americans that were unlikely to be held by whites. We confirm the distinctiveness of the names using over five million death certificates from Alabama, Illinois and North Carolina from the early twentieth century. The names we identify in the census records are similarly distinctive in these three independent data sources. Surprisingly, approximately the same percentage of African Americans had “black names” historically as they do today. No name that we identify as a historical black name, however, is a contemporary black name. The literature has assumed that black names are a product of the Civil Rights Movement, yet our results suggest that they are a long-standing cultural norm among African Americans.

"Coşgel, Metin M.; Ergene, Boğaç A.";Court records are used extensively in historical research. Preserved as summaries of daily legal proceedings, they give historians a unique opportunity to access information about the names, characteristics, and socio-economic status of individuals and the laws, local customs, and legal institutions of societies. Although researchers have noted various limitations of these records, the problem of selection bias has not been systematically studied. Since litigants would probably settle disputes in which one side is likely to be a clear winner, the cases that go to trial are more likely to be the difficult and uncertain ones that comprise a non-random subset of all disputes. This article presents a study of selection bias in Ottoman courts in the town of Kastamonu in northern Anatolia, from the late seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries. Disputes are categorized by type and the distribution of court participants is studied according to composition, gender, and socio-religious status. A regression analysis is run to determine the factors affecting the likelihood of cases being tried in court. The results indicate that the cases that ended up in court were selected systematically. If the selection bias is ignored, research based on Ottoman court records may be seriously flawed in its ability to yield general conclusions.;2014;The selection bias in court records: settlement and trial in eighteenth-century Ottoman Kastamonu;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Durré, Alain; Ledent, P.";In introducing a two-tier foreign exchange market under the Bretton Woods system, the Belgian monetary authorities aimed to insulate the domestic currency from (speculative) capital flows. By thus escaping the macroeconomic trilemma, they should have been able in practice to avoid taking account of foreign exchange developments in the determination of the monetary policy interest rate. The goal of this paper is to test this assumption empirically. Using a Taylor-rule approach, the paper shows that towards the collapse of the Bretton Woods system the volatility of the spread between the two segments of the foreign exchange market played a growing role in the determination of the monetary policy interest rate.;2014;Escaping the macroeconomic trilemma: the Belgian two-tier foreign exchange system under Bretton Woods;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Enflo, Kerstin; Lundh, Christer; Prado, Svante";Sweden experienced a decline in inter-county real wage differentials for agricultural workers between 1860 and 1940, historical evidence of early labor market integration well before widespread unionization in agriculture occurred. By means of dynamic panel data analysis, this paper examines whether internal and external migrations caused real wage beta convergence across Swedish counties. To account for statistical problems such as endogeneity of migration, time-invariant county characteristics and autocorrelation in the regression model, we adjust our estimates using fixed effects, instrumental variables and GMM. The preferred model shows that both internal and external migrations contributed to wage convergence before the First World War and internal migration mainly during the interwar years. The agglomeration effects of urbanization were not sufficiently pervasive to offset the labor supply effects of internal and external migrations.;2014;The role of migration in regional wage convergence: Evidence from Sweden 1860–1940;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Fagernäs, Sonja;A birth certificate establishes a child's legal identity and age, but few quantitative estimates of the significance of birth registration exist. Birth registration laws were enacted by U.S. states in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Using 1910–1930 census data, this study finds that minimum working age legislation was twice as effective in reducing under-aged employment if children had been born with a birth registration law, with positive implications for school attendance.

"Federico, Giovanni; Tena-Junguito, Antonio";The conventional wisdom about the early stages of modern economic growth in Italy is still heavily influenced by Cafagna in his book Dualismo e sviluppo nella storia d'Italia (Padova: Marsilio 1989). He argued that the exports of primary products to industrializing North-Western countries were the main source of growth and that exports of silk stimulated the industrialization of the North-West (the “industrial triangle”). However, the benefits did not extend to the rest of the country. In this paper, we argue that this view is not supported by the trade data. Italian exports grew slowly relative to European and world trade, and exports from the North grew less than the total. This view tallies well with some recent estimates of GDP per capita, which show no increase before the Unification of Italy (1861).;2014;The ripples of the industrial revolution: exports, economic growth, and regional integration in Italy in the early nineteenth century;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
FENSKE, JAMES;"The conventional view is that an increase in the value of a natural resource can lead to private property over it. Many Igbo groups in Nigeria, however, curtailed private rights over palm trees in response to the palm produce trade of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. I use the Ostrom (, ) framework for analyzing social-ecological systems to guide the construction of a model of this transition. An increase in the resource price leads the owner to prefer communal harvesting, which simplifies monitoring against theft. I support this framework with evidence from colonial court records. “Palm cutting always cause palaver.”

FENSKE, JAMES;Nigerian rubber exports expanded rapidly during the Second World War ?battle for rubber?. This was achieved by overcoming obstacles to greater exploitation of both wild and planted rubber. This article outlines Nigeria's wartime experience, focusing on the Benin region that dominated smallholder production after the war. British policies initially restricted rubber planting. After Japan occupied South-East Asia, Britain encouraged maximum production. Late in the war, officials struggled with the planting boom that had occurred. The war was a period of both continuity and change for Benin, and exposed the limited capacity of the colonial state.;2014;The battle for rubber in Benin;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Fernández, Eva;This article explores the role of culture in encouraging the diffusion of cooperation for the production and marketing of agricultural products, an organizational innovation that can be related to technical progress in the rural sector and higher living standards for farmers. The results of the zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) pooled regressions show that trust and religion were significant determinants of the diffusion of cooperatives among farmers in western countries. Results of the logit portion of these regressions suggest that the density of production was positively related to cooperation and that cooperation decreased where higher inequality in land distribution predominated.;2014;Trust, religion, and cooperation in western agriculture, 1880–1930;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Fourie, Johan; Fintel, Dieter von";The institutional literature emphasizes local conditions in explaining divergent colonial development. We posit that this view can be enriched by an important supply-side cause: the skills with which the settlers arrive. The Huguenots who arrived at the Cape Colony in 1688/9, we argue, possessed skills different from those of the incumbent farmers, and this enabled them to become more productive wine-makers. We demonstrate this by showing that this difference is explained by none of the standard factors of production, nor by any institutional differences between the French and the Dutch. We observe that a group of Huguenot descendants from wine-producing regions maintained their advantage in wine-making at the Cape over several generations. This disparity cannot be satisfactorily explained as resulting from first-mover advantage or social capital. Specialized skills gave the Huguenots from wine-producing regions a sustained competitive advantage. Our results show that colonial institutions are shaped not only by whether immigrants settle or not, which legal system they adopt, or their language, religion, or beliefs, but by the set of skills, knowledge, and experience brought from their country of origin. As such, cross-country comparisons may blur much of the detail when we analyse the effect that settlers have on the destination country.;2014;Settler skills and colonial development: the Huguenot wine-makers in eighteenth-century Dutch South Africa;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"FRANCK, RAPHAËL; JOHNSON, NOEL D.; Nye, John Vincent C.";The growth of the modern regulatory state is often explained in terms of an unambiguous increase in regulation driven by the actions of central governments. Contrary to this traditional narrative, we argue that as governments increased state capacity, they often strove to weaken the autarkic tendencies of regional laws, thereby promoting greater trade and a more integrated market. To show this, we exploit a quasi-natural experiment generated in the French wine industry by a law implemented on 1 January 1901 which lowered and harmonized various local tax rates. We demonstrate that high internal taxes on wine, set by regional governments, discouraged trade and protected small producers of expensive and low quality wines. We then trace how the political response to this tax decrease led to increases in wine regulation.;2014;From internal taxes to national regulation: Evidence from a French wine tax reform at the turn of the twentieth century;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Frankema, Ewout H.P.; Jerven, Morten";This article aims to make an empirical and theoretical contribution towards the creation of a continent-wide dataset on African population extending into the pre-1950 era. We investigate the reliability and the validity of the current population databases with the aim of working towards a consensus on the long-term series of African total population with a reliable 1950 benchmark. The cases of Kenya, Nigeria, and Ghana are explored to show the uneven coverage of census taking in colonial and post-colonial Africa and to demonstrate the need for an upward adjustment of the conventional 1950 benchmark. In addition, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of Manning's approach of projecting population growth estimates backwards in time by adopting the available Indian census data as African ?default growth rates?, and we propose an alternative approach by incorporating the demographic experiences of tropical land-abundant countries in South-East Asia.;2014;Writing history backwards or sideways: towards a consensus on African population, 1850–2010;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Fremdling, Rainer; Staeglin, Reiner";We here present the earliest input–output table of Germany: It covers forty economic branches, five final demand categories, and five primary inputs. The symmetric table for 1936 is completely based on original statistical data and does not rely on separate supply and use tables. The core of our endeavor is based on the German industrial census of 1936. The input–output table offers a new benchmark for gross domestic product (GDP) and thus production, income, and expenditure of Germany in 1936. We found a comparably high level of GDP and a significantly higher mixed income/operating surplus, which hints at exceptionally high incomes and hidden profits of armament industry. We illustrate the use of the new input–output table for German historical national accounts and apply our findings to reassess the impact of military spending on employment and production.;2014;Output, national income, and expenditure: an input–output table of Germany in 1936;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Gardner, Leigh A.;Recent research on exchange rate regime choice in developing countries has revealed that a range of factors, from weak fiscal institutions to high costs of borrowing in their own currencies, limits the range of options available to these countries. This article uses the case of Liberia to illustrate that new states in Africa during the gold standard era faced similar limitations, even in the absence of formal colonial rule. The rapid depreciation of the Liberian dollar in the nineteenth century led to the adoption of sterling as a medium of exchange and store of value. This initially made it easier for Liberia to service its sterling-denominated debt and for Liberians to purchase imports from Britain. However, as economic relations with the US deepened during the twentieth century, instability in the pound?dollar exchange rate created serious dislocations in the Liberian economy, ultimately leading to the official adoption of the US dollar in 1943. The story of Liberia illustrates the long-standing challenges of globalization for peripheral economies and suggests the need for a reassessment of the origins and impact of colonial monetary regimes.;2014;The rise and fall of sterling in Liberia, 1847–1943;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Garrido, S.;Social capital—defined here as the norms and networks that create the necessary trust for people to cooperate to solve collective-action problems—also has negative effects. They are usually a consequence of “bonding” social capital, but not always, as this article shows from a new perspective. It uses community irrigation institutions, cooperatives, and the citrus industry in eastern Spain to test Robert Putman's thesis on the ability of social capital to generate virtuous equilibria. It shows that social capital itself hindered “bridging” cooperation (in some cases, centuries' old) on certain issues from becoming a generalized culture of cooperation.;2014;Plenty of trust, not much cooperation: social capital and collective action in early twentieth century eastern Spain;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Gazeley, Ian; VERDON, NICOLA";Two important and well-known surveys of the household budgets of the English rural labouring poor were produced by David Davies and Frederick Eden in the 1790s. We revisit these from the point of view of their original rationale — an investigation of the characteristics and extent of poverty in the countryside. We argue that Davies' standard of ‘tolerable comfort’ can lay claim to being the first poverty line based upon the application of a minimum consumption standard to household income. We find that the majority of households fall below this standard, although those in the south of England were worst off, that family size was the largest coefficient and poverty reduced as the age of the first child increased. The incidence of poverty was not highly correlated with the absence of a woman wage earner.;2014;The first poverty line?

Gerhold, Dorian;This article uses newspaper advertisements to chart the changes in speeds and fares of stage coaches, identifying the main periods of increasing speeds among London coaches as the 1760s?80s and 1810s?20s, separated by a period when speeds declined. It then measures productivity growth. Fares of London coaches in 1835?6 were about 27 per cent of what they would have been but for improvements in horses, vehicles, and roads from 1750, and the two main periods of productivity growth correspond to those of rising speeds. Speeds and productivity of regional coaches increased more smoothly. The rising productivity firmly identifies road transport as one of the modernizing sectors of the economy. New figures are put forward for the growing number of London and regional coaches, indicating rapid growth in passenger miles. While turnpike trusts had little impact before the 1750s, their increasing effectiveness, together with the use of steel springs and improved horses, was crucial to the rising productivity of the 1760s?80s, and even more so to that of the 1810s?20s. The cross roads were apparently poorer than London roads in the late eighteenth century, but thereafter the gap narrowed.;2014;The development of stage coaching and the impact of turnpike roads, 1653–1840;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Gil, Ricard; Lampe, Ryan";Hollywood converted to sound in three years.

We investigate this puzzling adoption profile using detailed data on 7,022 movies between 1940 and 1959. These data indicate differences in studio size and complementarity between genre and color impeded the rapid diffusion of color. These data also indicate that disadoption followed weak returns to a wave of color releases that were encouraged by the introductionof a low-cost color process.;2014;The Adoption of New Technologies: Understanding Hollywood's (Slow and Uneven) Conversion to Color;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Glaser, Darrell J.; RAHMAN, AHMED S.";This paper explores how technological changes affected labor allocations within the U.S. Navy. During the latter nineteenth century, the officer corps was highly specialized, split between groups of line and staff officers. Developments in general purpose technologies created a dilemma for the organization, as it balanced between the benefits of a specialized workforce implementing increasingly complex technologies with rising communication and coordination costs. We first document the nature and extent of labor specialization in the mid-nineteenth-century Navy—engineers worked more with newer and larger vessels, while line officers worked more with unskilled personnel. The Navy endeavored to destroy this distinction, forcing generalized training and tasks for all officers. We suggest that the Navy’s phased-in approach was an effective strategy, helping the U.S. to become a world-class naval power.;2014;Engineering and labor specialization during the industrial revolution;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Gragnolati, Ugo M.; Moschella, Daniele; Pugliese, Emanuele";Scale economies and demand, combined with the relative prices of input factors, can provide an economic explanation to the location and timing of the Industrial Revolution. Its labor-saving innovations were profitable only above a minimum output threshold, which allowed to cover the upfront cost of capital. In turn, the possibility to exceed such threshold depended on consumer demand, which was affected by the level and by the distribution of real income. The case of the spinning jenny and the cotton industry in England and France serves as a valuable case study to show how scale and demand considerations might have mattered even at the eve of the Industrial Revolution, thus implying also a potentially important role for income distribution.;2014;The spinning jenny and the guillotine: technology diffusion at the time of revolutions;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Gupta, Bishnupriya;Industrial investment in colonial India was segregated by the export industries, such as tea and jute that relied on British firms and the import substituting cotton textile industry that was dominated by Indian firms. Empirical evidence in this article does not suggest that barriers to entry faced by Indian entrepreneurs created this separation. Informational asymmetry played an important role. British entrepreneurs knew the export markets and the Indian entrepreneurs were familiar with local markets. Conditional on the initial advantage in entry, social network effects determined subsequent entry of firms by ethnicity and created separate spheres of industrial investment.;2014;Discrimination or Social Networks?

Gupta, Bishnupriya;"Marriage is universal for women in India, but the marriage rate for men varies across regions, where the region is a proxy for shared cultural norms. A preference for sons results in a biased sex ratio towards men and creates a shortage of brides in the marriage market. Using the Indian census of 1931, the article finds that son preference was a regional phenomenon and led to a low marriage rate for men. Using caste-level information, the article finds no evidence that men from the upper castes enjoyed an advantage in the marriage market as the theoretical literature predicts. The regional differences in gender bias and marriage market outcomes have persisted over the twentieth century and indicate the persistence of cultural values. The long-run changes show that the marriage squeeze has reduced the surplus of men in all regions; however, the regional differences in son preference and marriage outcomes were still the same in 2001.";2014;Where have all the brides gone?

Gutberlet, Theresa;The adoption of water, steam, and electric power transformed manufacturing in the nineteenth century. This article studies the relationship between this technological change and the spatial distribution of manufacturing industries in the German Empire during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. The adoption of steam powered machinery created incentives for manufacturers to form industry clusters near coal mining regions. Specifically, this article shows that a one standard deviation increase in the average size of steam power operations was associated with a rise in geographic concentration of one-quarter of a standard deviation. In contrast, a one standard deviation increase in the size of water power operations was associated with a drop in geographic concentration of one-sixth of a standard deviation. This is consistent with the constraint that water powered plants had to be located on a stream with a sufficient gradient and away from other water powered plants to avoid disruption from neighbouring gates and dams. Together the findings indicate that the transition from water to steam powered machinery contributed to the geographic concentration of manufacturing in the nineteenth century.;2014;Mechanization and the spatial distribution of industries in the German Empire, 1875 to 1907;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Heyberger, Laurent;Since the pioneering study of Le Roy Ladurie and his team, the idea that mean height can be considered as a reliable indicator of the standard of living has emerged from a long debate among historians and economists. Considering height in this respect, nineteenth-century France, unlike most Western countries, did not pay an urban penalty. Thanks to a substantial set of individual data (105,324 observations), based on the draft lottery of Frenchmen born in the year 1848, we are able to prove that this “French exception” did not, in fact, exist. The larger the town, the shorter were the conscripts. Among the towns, Paris had the shortest conscripts. By combining individual data with the agricultural survey of 1852, we are able to identify those factors that compensated for this urban penalty—that were positively correlated with height: nutritional availability, the literacy rate, and life expectancy.;2014;Received wisdom versus reality: height, nutrition, and urbanization in mid-nineteenth-century France;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Ho, Chun-Yu; Li, Dan";This article provides a quantitative assessment of contemporary beliefs about historical events by econometrically identifying ?break points? in China's domestic bond market from 1921 to 1942. We find that these ?break points? usually coincided with the events highlighted by the Shanghai Newspaper?an influential daily newspaper produced during the time of the Republic of China. These events are also generally considered to be crucial by historians?for example, the Japanese invasion of Manchuria and the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War. However, some events to which historians attach great importance, such as the conflicts between Nationalists and Communists in the 1930s, were not reflected in the bond market and did not attract much media attention. Some events, such as the Sino-Japanese ceasefire in Tanggu in 1933, were thought to be crucial by contemporaries, but have been downplayed by later observers.;2014;A mirror of history: China's bond market, 1921–42;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Houpt, Stefan Oliver; Rojo Cagigal, Juan Carlos";What drove social conflict in Spain’s industrial areas in the period before the Spanish Civil War? This paper is concerned with contrasting the determinants of working-class conflict in northern Spain at the beginning of the twentieth century. Our hypothesis is that the key determinant of conflicts in emerging industrial areas during the interwar period was the struggle to obtain satisfactory family income in a context of combined high price fluctuation, unemployment and economic boom and bust. We suggest two new ways to decipher how economic factors interact with labour conflict. We introduce the family as the relevant income unit when considering wage struggles and relative deprivation. And secondly, we study the reactions to short-term variations of income on families by using monthly rather than quarterly or annual data.;2014;Relative deprivation and labour conflict during Spain’s industrialization: the Bilbao estuary, 1914–1936;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

For West Africans, the contribution from French taxpayers was almost negligible: mainland France provided about 2 percent of French West Africa's revenue.

Jacks, David S.;In the wake of the Great Depression, the Canadian government embarked on a stunning reversal in its commercial policy.

The results suggest that the conference was a failure from this perspective.

We develop a model that explains (i) why pre-industrial states relied on private individuals to collect taxes; (ii) why after 1600 both England and France moved from competitive methods for collecting revenues to allocating the right to collect taxes to a small group of financiers—an intermediate institution that we call cabal tax farming—and (iii) why this centralization led to investments in fiscal capacity and increased fiscal standardization. We provide detailed historical evidence that supports our prediction that rulers abandoned the competitive allocation of tax rights in favor of cabal tax farming in order to gain access to inside credit, and that this transition was accompanied by investments in standardization. Finally (iv) we show why this intermediate institution proved to be self-undermining in England, where it was quickly replaced by direct collection, but lasted in France until the French Revolution.";2014;Tax farming and the origins of state capacity in England and France;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Using new data on inheritances, we extend estimates of mortality back to the mid-thirteenth century and find, by contrast, that deaths from unfree tenants to the nobility were strongly affected by living standards. Looking at a large sample of parishes after 1540, we find that the positive check had weakened considerably by 1650 even though living standards were static at best, but persisted in London for another century despite its higher wages. In both cases the disappearance of the positive check coincided with the introduction of systematic poor relief, suggesting that government action may have played a role in breaking the link between harvest failure and mass mortality.;2014;Living standards and mortality since the middle ages;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Killick, John;This article argues that the massive increase in transatlantic British and Irish emigration after 1840 was enabled by declining fares and ocean travel costs. New series of transatlantic steerage fares drawn from the unique Cope Line records at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania (HSP) show westward fares fell rapidly from 1830. Adjusted for British and US manual wages, westward travel costs, including provisions, almost halved between 1847 and 1851?3, when Irish migration peaked. Hence although the Irish had to leave Ireland, they might not otherwise have gone so extensively to North America. Eastward travel costs also fell after 1830, encouraging an unexpectedly large return migration to Britain in the late1850s, and maybe earlier.;2014;Transatlantic steerage fares, British and Irish migration, and return migration, 1815–60;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Klovland, Jan Tore;This paper reviews some methodological and practical problems encountered in the construction of historical price indices. The underlying data sets in such studies are often characterized by heterogenous and incomplete price series. It is shown that by using the repeat sales method for constructing the subindices for individual commodity groups, some of the main problems can be overcome. The procedures are illustrated by material from the construction of monthly price indices for Norway from the year 1777 to 1920. The price indices shed new light on two great wartime inflationary episodes in Norway: 1807–17 and 1913–20. In spite of a 61-fold increase in the price level in the first period and a four-fold increase in the second, it is found that, after inflation had been brought under control, prices reverted to a level consistent with the purchasing power parity principle.;2014;New methods for construction of historical price indices, with an illustration from Norway, 1777–1920*;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Lampe, Markus; Sharp, Paul Richard";This article considers an example of the impact of a new good on producers of close substitutes: the invention of margarine and its rapid introduction into the British market from the mid-1870s. This presented a challenge to the traditional suppliers of that market, butter producers from different European countries. We argue that the capacity to react quickly to the appearance of this cheap substitute by improving quality and establishing product differentiation was critical for the fortunes of butter producers. This is illustrated by a discussion of the different reactions to margarine and quality upgrading in Ireland, Denmark, and the Netherlands. A statistical analysis using monthly data for Britain from 1881?7 confirms that margarine had a greater impact on the price of poor quality butter than that of high quality butter, presumably because it was a stronger substitute.;2014;Greasing the wheels of rural transformation?

Lehmann-Hasemeyer, Sibylle;Large universal banks played a major role in Germany's industrialization because they provided loans to industry and thereby helped firms to overcome liquidity constraints. Previous research has also argued that they were equally important for the German stock market. This article provides quantitative and qualitative evidence that although the market for underwriters was dominated by a small oligopoly of six large banks, there was still perceptible competition, which kept fees and short-run profits low. Another interesting finding presented here is the absence of a signalling effect to investors. Neither underpricing nor the one-year performance was different for the IPOs issued by one of the Big Six. Thus, although the German IPO business was in the hands of a small oligopoly, investors did not benefit from the lack of competition. One explanation is that the quality of IPOs on the German stock market of the time was very good in general as a result of the competition between underwriters, but also as a result of the tight regulation of underwriting, which ensured the quality of all firms on the German stock market.;2014;Taking firms to the stock market: IPOs and the importance of large banks in imperial Germany, 1896–1913;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Lehmann-Hasemeyer, Sibylle; Hauber, Philipp; Opitz, Alexander";We approach the issue of the economic effects of democracy by examining which expectations investors held about the effect of democratization in the Kingdom of Saxony in 1896 and 1909. We do this by linking their investment behavior on the Berlin Stock Exchange to political events in Saxony. Here the electoral law was changed twice: In 1896 a very restrictive franchise was introduced, which was abolished in 1909 and replaced by a more democratic electoral law. Our study reveals that the Berlin Stock Exchange reacted to political changes and elections in Saxony. This is an important finding since historical research has claimed that the increased democratization in the German Kaiserreich measured in a larger participation of the population was not accompanied by a larger political influence of the parliaments. Furthermore we can show that for capital owners the possible negative effects seemed to outweigh possible positive effects of democratization. This is the first time that it has been possible to provide quantitative evidence for such antidemocratic sentiments.;2014;The Political Stock Market in the German Kaiserreich — Do Markets Punish the Extension of the Suffrage to the Benefit of the Working Class?

"Lindert, Peter H.; Nafziger, Steven";Careful handling of an eclectic data set reveals how unequal were the incomes of different classes of Russians on the eve of Revolution. We estimate incomes by economic and social class in each of the fifty provinces of European Russia. On the eve of military defeat and the 1905 Revolution, Russian income inequality was middling by the standards of that era, and less severe than is inequality today in China, the United States, and Russia itself. We note how the interplay of some distinctive fiscal and relative-price features of Imperial Russia might have shaped the now-revealed level of inequality.;2014;Russian Inequality on the Eve of Revolution;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

In this article, we present a method for aggregating historically relevant environmental pressure indicators, thereby acknowledging that the complexity of environmental problems calls for multi-indicator approaches. Secondly, we use the aggregate for exploring the long-run dynamics between the environment and economic growth, using a methodology used in the study of the so-called environmental Kuznets curve. We find evidence for a right tilted-S form dynamic relationship. The dynamics is analyzed in a framework stressing that new knowledge of environmental problems is an important driver for the changing relationship, here called “the Pasteur effect”.;2014;The environmental Kuznets curve and the Pasteur effect: environmental costs in Sweden 1850–2000;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

It examines how they opted for inelastic demand products of highly concentrated supply which lent themselves to market control (mercury, nickel, lead, and copper and sulphur) by taking administrative monopolies (mercury from the state-owned Almadén mines in Spain) or by controlling the leading businesses of the respective markets (Le Nickel, Peñarroya, and Rio Tinto).

Martinelli, Pablo;This paper proposes a new interpretation of the historically controversial role of Italian latifundia. Relying on standard economic theory, the paper explores a simple though neglected mechanism linking land inequality and inefficiency: market power. In underdeveloped economies with serious constraints on labor mobility, high ownership concentration will endow landowners with market power in local labor markets. The resulting equilibrium explains many of the often criticized features of latifundia, without the need to factor in irrational behavior (the preferred explanation of Italian traditional historians) or social institutions and capital market imperfections (explanations advanced by economists in different contexts). According to the model here explored the main effects of inequality are of a distributive rather than of a productive nature. The market power hypothesis is strongly supported by the available quantitative evidence provided by an unexploited dataset on all local labor markets of Italy at the end of the 1930s.;2014;Latifundia revisited: Market power, land inequality and agricultural efficiency.

Martinelli, Pablo;This paper sheds new light on the agricultural side of the Italian regional divide from an economic geography perspective, following a Von Thünen approach. The central hypothesis is that the development of the nonagricultural economy in the Northern cities drove the location of agricultural output and inputs during the interwar years. A new database on Italian agriculture around 1930 fully confirms the key role of access to domestic markets in shaping agricultural activity. Thus, the causes of Southern agriculture falling behind are revealed: it is not very surprising that an agricultural divergence joined an already ongoing industrial divergence during a period in which international markets collapsed. It was the growth of Northern industry that led to the growth of Northern agriculture, and not vice versa.;2014;Von Thünen south of the Alps: access to markets and interwar Italian agriculture;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Marwah, Hanaan;Scholars have struggled to understand the role of investment in the slow growth of post-Independence sub-Saharan Africa. Existing research has largely relied on national accounting data, which suggests low returns on investment in the region. This article uses data gathered during fieldwork to investigate the quality of the investment data in the national accounts of Nigeria, Africa's most populous economy. It proposes a new investment series which can be compared to those in Nigeria's national accounts for 1976?85. It provides an alternative view of investment and productivity during the country's crucial oil boom period, when Nigeria had significant funding available for investment but this investment did not result in long-term economic growth. Data are drawn from construction surveys, publicly listed and privately held construction company financial records, and industry publications. The new series suggests that for many years of the oil boom, approximately two-thirds of what was recorded as having been investment in Nigeria's national accounts was not investment at all. Much of this was ?ghost construction?, projects paid for but never completed. This indicates that actual investment was far more productive than has previously been appreciated.;2014;What explains slow sub-Saharan African growth?

McIntosh, Marjorie K.;"This article analyses 30 accounts of income and expenditure left by Collectors for the Poor in Elizabethan England, before the period known as the old poor law. Collectors were appointed by parishes and incorporated boroughs in accordance with the poor laws of 1552 and 1563, but few of their fragile records survive. The accounts examined here document early use of compulsory rates to provide income, but several features of the distribution of relief differ from patterns common in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Adult male recipients outnumbered women in many of the parishes; children were frequently helped directly; and cities and towns assisted a smaller fraction of their total populations than did villages but awarded larger per capita payments. Accounts from the 10 villages and small towns analysed most fully show that Elizabethan Collectors were moving away from the late medieval practice of providing only occasional aid; increasingly they awarded regular payments to a selected subset of the local poor. Comparison with the early seventeenth century suggests that the poor laws of 1598 and 1601 contributed to a transition that was already underway but did not create a new system of relief.";2014;Poor relief in Elizabethan English communities: an analysis of Collectors' accounts;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Muehlhoff, Katharina;"The notion that professional, efficient and non-corrupt bureaucracies foster economic growth is virtually uncontested. In spite of this wide consensus, central questions remain unanswered. Thus, while the harmful effects of dysfunctional administrations are extensively covered in the theoretical literature, little is known about the empirical relevance and the expected costs of insufficient administrative rationalization. And while efficient bureaucracies are considered a key ingredient to institutional performance, the existing research rarely investigates how desirable administrative structures have been implemented in history or which concrete policy measures constitute feasible reform strategies for present-day development countries. The present paper therefore aims at providing empirical evidence to dose this lacuna; to do so, it relies on the case of administrative reforms in the last three decades of the nineteenth century in Meiji Japan. Building on an exceptionally detailed set of official statistics and documentary sources, it constructs a panel of 45 Japanese prefectures and assesses the impact of heterogeneous reform implementation on canonical indicators of economic performance including measures of regional GDP, business activity and financial market development. The central results of the econometric analysis are that delayed administrative rationalization came along with a statistically significant and robust penalty on all development indicators. Moreover, this effect was remarkably persistent over time, as the data show that late-reforming prefectures performed systematically worse than the administrative forerunners until well into the twentieth century.";2014;The economic costs of sleaze or how replacing samurai with bureaucrats boosted regional growth in Meiji Japan;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

We find that states that exported commodities undergoing international booms, between 1889 and 1930, had significantly larger export tax revenues and could spend more on education, while other states lagged behind. Yet, such positive effect of commodity booms on education expenditures was muted in states that either had more slaves before abolition or cultivated cotton during colonial times.;2014;Colonial Institutions, Trade Shocks, and the Diffusion of Elementary Education in Brazil, 1889–1930;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Nyberg, Peter; Vaihekoski, Mika";Using new monthly series collected together for the first time for Finland, this paper analyses the performance and development of the Finnish equity and money markets as well as the equity premium and inflation from 1912 to 2009. The series are analyzed and compared to similar series from Sweden and USA. Continuously compounded nominal returns in Finland have been high, 12.91 and 6.44 % per annum for the stock and money markets, respectively. However, taking into account the high annual average inflation rate of 7.77, the Finnish market has provided clearly lower real returns than the US market. On the other hand, the equity premium, 10.14 % per annum, is found to be comparable to that of the United States (9.35 %) and higher than that in Sweden (6.01 %) using an approach similar to Mehra and Prescott (Handbook of the economics of finance, vol 1B. Financial Markets and Asset Pricing, North Holland, 2003). Finally, our empirical evidence suggests that as the Finnish stock market has matured, it shows an increasing degree of informational efficiency while at the same time becoming more intertwined with international markets.;2014;Equity premium in Finland and long-term performance of the Finnish equity and money markets;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
OLDLAND, JOHN;Estimates of wool production based on the exports of wool and cloth, and an assumption that domestic cloth consumption was, optimistically, constant, suggest that wool production fell by almost a third from the early fourteenth to the mid-fifteenth century, and had not fully recovered even by the mid-sixteenth century. However, after the Black Death, much of England's arable was converted to pasture, mainly for sheep, and this process accelerated after 1470. These two observations are contradictory. This article provides new numbers of adult sheep based on estimates of domestic cloth consumption, cloth exports, the changing weight of cloth, and fleece yields. The conclusion is that the adult sheep population only declined by around 13 per cent from 1310 to 1440, and had risen dramatically by the mid-sixteenth century.;2014;Wool and cloth production in late medieval and early Tudor England;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Onorato, Massimiliano Gaetano; Scheve, Kenneth; Stasavage, David";We investigate how technology has influenced the size of armies. During the nineteenth century, the development of the railroad made it possible to field and support mass armies, significantly increasing the observed size of military forces. During the late twentieth century, further advances in technology made it possible to deliver explosive force from a distance and with precision, making mass armies less desirable. We find support for our technological account using a new data set covering thirteen great powers between 1600 and 2000.

Paik, Christopher;Korean families belong to clan lineages, bon-guan, that originated in the imperial Joseon period, 1392–1897. We can rank bon-guan by their average Joseon status, measured by the recorded number of civil service exam passers. In the disruptions of the Japanese occupation and the Korean War it is believed many families switched their bon-guan to more distinguished ones. Nevertheless from 1960 onward, when bon-guan became fixed again, there is a correlation between the average prestige of bon-guans by region in Korea and average educational attainment. This paper uses that correlation, and its decline over time, to measure the implied rate of social mobility in modern Korea. Implied intergenerational educational mobility is very low, much lower than conventionally measured social mobility rates.;2014;Does lineage matter?

PAIVA ABREU, MARCELO de;The British effort in the Second World War required massive external financing which depended on Lend-Lease and the accumulation of sterling balances. Indebtedness in sterling balances corresponded to almost 38 per cent of this total at the end of the war. Portuguese sterling balances, although a small share of the total, were important because of pre-emptive purchases, especially of wolfram, and because of the ?gold clause? which was to be applied to outstanding balances. Portugal's willingness to finance British purchases contrasts with the requirement of German payments in goods or cash for their purchases in Portugal. The settlement of Portuguese sterling balances in August 1945 was singular as it preceded the Anglo-American settlement of December 1945 which had important consequences for sterling balance holders, as the US insisted that the US$3.75 billion loan should not be used to settle British war debts. Postwar settlement of British debt through a long-term loan from Portugal to Britain contrasts with settlements that involved the sale of British assets. Salazar's concerns about the postwar international position of Portugal, the Portuguese Empire, and the survival of the Portuguese regime are relevant in explaining his pro-British stance during and after the war.;2014;A ‘blank cheque'?

Wages were heavily influenced by two long-lasting demographic shocks, the Justinian Plague and the Black Death and the slow population recovery that followed. As a result, they remained above the subsistence minimum for most of the medieval era. We also argue that the environment of high wages that emerged after the Justinian Plague contributed to the Golden Age of Islam by creating demand for higher income goods.;2014;Plagues, Wages, and Economic Change in the Islamic Middle East, 700–1500;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Panza, Laura;This article presents an investigation of the process of decline and rebirth of textile manufacturing in two Middle Eastern regions, Egypt and the Izmir region, during the first wave of globalization (1850?1914). Through the application of the ?Dutch disease? model, it explores the linkages between terms of trade and industrialization. These are further related to the evolution of price transmission between domestic and global raw cotton markets. Findings indicate that different levels of market integration have contributed to diverging trajectories in industrial development in the two regions: while in Egypt the process of de-industrialization was not reversed, in the Izmir region weaker international price transmission facilitated the creation of a nascent domestic textile industry. However, terms of trade patterns and relative price movements are only one of the causes that can explain the differences between the two regions.;2014;De-industrialization and re-industrialization in the Middle East: reflections on the cotton industry in Egypt and in the Izmir region;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Rentier societies thrive when the rate of return on private wealth r is larger than the growth rate g (say, r=4% vs g=2%).

Prado, Svante;This article applies Harberger's yeast versus mushrooms dichotomy to Swedish manufacturing industries in the four decades prior to the First World War. The evidence, broken down to cover five sub-periods, points to a growth process resembling that of mushrooms more than that of yeast. In addition, it is argued that a yeast-like (even) pattern of productivity growth rates invites one to search for a general purpose technology at work, whereas mushroom-like progress leads one to dismiss the idea that a small number of technologies spilled over to a large number of manufacturing processes. The era under investigation coincides with the peak of the use of steam power and the infancy of electricity. The evidence makes it unlikely that steam in Sweden was a general purpose technology with the potential to affect the progress in productivity across industries in a yeast-like fashion. The rampant spread of electricity may have contributed to the yeast-like pattern in the last sub-period preceding the First World War.;2014;Yeast or mushrooms?

In this paper, we revisit the immediate post-war period in both parts of Germany to obtain a more comprehensive picture of the output and productivity shocks operating in both economies. Our principal finding is that the dismantling of the capital stock alone cannot explain the inferior performance of the East German economy. The collapse of output after the war and the ensuing recovery in both parts of the country were driven by total factor productivity; changes in factor endowments were of second-order significance. West Germany began to lead East Germany in industrial labor productivity well before the economic reforms of 1948 could make their mark.

They show that the region likely achieved modest improvements in per capita GDP over this period despite a number of demographic factors that tended to slow the pace of growth. Nonetheless the rate of growth we find is below that commonly assumed to have prevailed in eighteenth century North America and calls those estimates into question. The striking feature of the region's economy in the eighteenth century was not the rising living-standard, but its ability to achieve rapid extensive growth without a decline in living standards. To contemporaries this extensive growth and short-term volatility in incomes must have been much more visible than any trend improvement in overall well-being.;2014;Economic growth in the Mid-Atlantic region: Conjectural estimates for 1720 to 1800;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Sáiz, Patricio;In this article, we reflect on how patents of introduction or importation, which compose an institutional policy related to weak IPR systems, could influence long-term international technology transfer. Both theoretically and empirically, the consequences of strengthening IPRs in lagging economies for technology transfer and innovation remain unclear. Although the mainstream literature tends to link stronger patent enforcement with better invention and innovation markets now and in the past, new theoretical and historical evidence supports extreme complexity in the relationship between IPR extension and scope and technological diffusion. For the first time, in this study, we analyze a large series of patents of introduction, which were a common feature of the early stages of almost all patent systems designed to favor technology transfer and innovation above original inventor property rights. Though typically used by pioneers, followers, and latecomers, we know little of how they functioned and their consequences. In this study, we analyze the use of patents of introduction throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in Spain, which was a lagging country on the European periphery. The results demonstrate that this institutional policy could facilitate technology transfer, innovation, and advancement at earlier stages of industrialization. As additional research has demonstrated, such evidence may have serious implications for IPR treatment in both developing and underdeveloped economies.;2014;Did patents of introduction encourage technology transfer?

Salisbury, Laura;This paper explores the extent to which unskilled internal migrants in the United States were motivated by the possibility of upward occupational mobility. Drawing on the literature on contemporary migrant selection and sorting, I argue that workers with greater potential for occupational upgrading may have selected themselves out of counties with low skill premiums and sorted themselves into counties with high skill premiums. Using linked data from the U.S. Census and county-level wage data, I present results consistent with this argument, with a focus on shorter distance movers. Conditioning on migrant status, I find that unskilled migrants who moved to places with high skill premiums were most likely to upgrade. I offer some evidence that migrant sorting explains much of this result. My results imply that previous research focusing solely on wage gains provides an incomplete picture of the factors motivating east–west migration in nineteenth century America.;2014;Selective migration, wages, and occupational mobility in nineteenth century America;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Schneider, Eric B.;This article challenges the growing consensus in the literature that medieval manorial managers were price responsive in their production decisions. Using prices of and acreages planted with wheat, barley, and oats on manors held by the bishop of Winchester from 1325 to 1370, price elasticities of supply are estimated for each grain in aggregate and on each particular manor. Aggregate price elasticities of supply for wheat, barley, and oats were rarely statistically significant and when significant were very low compared with elasticities estimated for developing and developed countries in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The low levels of agricultural supply response in fourteenth-century England suggest that commercialization was not as dominant in the medieval economy as has been argued. Thus, structural changes in the economy, such as the leasing of demesnes, the growth of wage labour, and the end of villeinage, may have been more important than price fluctuations in driving long-run economic change after the Black Death. Likewise, a shift from low price responsiveness to higher price responsiveness could have been an important part of the capitalist transformation of agriculture in the early modern period.;2014;Prices and production: agricultural supply response in fourteenth-century England;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Selgert, Felix;This paper is based on the difference between the formal introduction of a Weberian bureaucracy and its actual implementation through state officials. This difference between the formal institutional framework and its actual implementation could lead to failed reforms. On the other side, there were states which successfully introduced a Weberian bureaucracy like the German state of Baden in the nineteenth century. This paper argues that Civil Service reforms in Baden during the first two decades of the nineteenth century established an internal labor market with a hierarchy of pay levels and clearly defined rules of promotion. These rules of promotion made advancement in the hierarchy, and therefore, an increase in remuneration, inter alia dependent on the performance in regard to administrative processes and rules of professional conduct. This rule generated an incentive to implement the new formal institutional framework, because sticking to the rules led to a monetary reward. The paper tests this hypothesis empirically using a logit as well as a panel regression approach. In doing so, I find that a positive assessment about a district magistrate’s (Amtmann) performance in regard to formal administrative processes and rules of professional conduct increased his probability of promotion by 81 %. The paper also finds incentive mechanisms like a shirking wage. However, it seems that the sound working of these incentive mechanisms took ca. two decades.;2014;Performance, pay and promotion: implementing a Weberian bureaucracy in nineteenth century Baden;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Shibamoto, Masahiko; SHIZUME, MASATO";A veteran finance minister, Takahashi Korekiyo, brought an early recovery for Japan from the Great Depression of the 1930s by prescribing a combination of expansionary fiscal, exchange rate, and monetary policies. To explore the comprehensive transmission mechanism of Takahashi's macroeconomic policy package, including the expectation channel, we construct a structural vector auto-regression (S-VAR) model with three state variables (output, price, and the inflation expectations) and three policy variables (fiscal balance, exchange rate, and money stock). Our analysis reveals that the exchange rate adjustment undertaken as an independent policy tool had the strongest effect, and that changes in people's expectations played a significant role for escaping from the Great Depression. During the second half of 1931, in particular, speculation on Japan's departure from the gold standard and the inflation that was likely to follow reversed the existing expectations: instead of expecting deflation, people began to expect inflation, months ahead of the actual departure from the gold standard. As a whole, the choice of the level of the exchange rate was crucial for changing people's expectations as well as promoting exports.;2014;Exchange rate adjustment, monetary policy and fiscal stimulus in Japan's escape from the Great Depression;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Sng, Tuan-Hwee;This paper argues that China's size was one reason behind its relative decline in the nineteenth century. A ruler governing a large country faces severe agency problems. Given his monitoring difficulties, his agents have strong incentives to extort the taxpayers. This forces him to keep taxes low to prevent revolts. Economic expansion could aggravate corruption and cause further fiscal weakening. To support the model's predictions, I show that the Chinese state taxed and administered sparingly, especially in regions far from Beijing. Furthermore, its fiscal capacity contracted steadily during the prosperous eighteenth century, sowing the seeds for the nineteenth-century crises.;2014;Size and dynastic decline: The principal-agent problem in late imperial China, 1700–1850;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Stanfors, Maria; Leuning, Timothy; Eriksson, Björn; Karlsson, Tobias";Women have typically been paid less than men throughout history. We investigate earnings in Swedish cigar making around 1900. Strength was unimportant, yet the gender wage gap was large. Differences in characteristics, such as age and experience, and different jobs within firms, account for two-thirds of the gap overall, and the entire gap for piece-rate workers. Firms were as willing to employ women as men in the better-paying piece-rate section, and women were willing to take those jobs. In contrast, discrimination was extensive in the time-rate section. Men in this section benefited from greater outside opportunities and customary wages elsewhere. Theory holds that labour market discrimination will reduce profitability, and make firm survival harder, a proposition that has never been tested historically. We find that cigar firms that feminized their workforces most extensively were most likely to survive. Product market competition prevented firms employing (overpaid) men to any great extent. We argue that economic historians must interpret industry-specific gender wage differentials in the context of workers' outside opportunities, and in the context of product markets, which can?and in this case did?limit firms' room for manoeuvre.;2014;Gender, productivity, and the nature of work and pay: evidence from the late nineteenth-century tobacco industry;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Stone, David;Climatic change is currently viewed as one of the main causes of the so-called crisis of the early fourteenth century. It is well established that England saw increased storminess and heavy rainfall in this period, but this article suggests that the impact of drought?which became a common feature of the English climate during the 1320s and early 1330s?has been overlooked. Based primarily on a detailed analysis of account rolls for over 60 of the best-documented manors in this period, the article establishes that drought brought devastating harvest failure and caused severe outbreaks of a number of diseases, plausibly including enteric infections, malaria, and winter and spring fevers. As a result, mortality surged and population levels fell in communities in affected regions, which were mainly confined to the southern and eastern counties of England. The article concludes that such regional variation significantly affects our understanding of demographic, agricultural, and even fiscal trends in this period. Although we should not disregard the human factors influencing the impact of environmental shocks, England was plainly struck with indubitable force by extreme weather in this pivotal phase of the medieval economy.;2014;The impact of drought in early fourteenth-century England;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Talbott, Siobhan;This article explores Irish migration, settlement, and commerce in the Atlantic coast ports of France in the period between the Glorious Revolution of 1688?9 and the Jacobite uprising of 1715. Drawing on extensive archival material and using current methodologies, this study suggests that the composition of society was vital in the development of international associations. This is particularly pertinent in a period characterized by warfare, religious fervour, and the rise of Jacobitism. Common allegiance to Catholicism and support for the Stuart dynasty in both Ireland and France provided a framework conducive to international cooperation, but the Irish who settled in France held both Catholic and Reformed beliefs, and were not necessarily products of the Jacobite movement. Migration and integration, and commercial practices and successes, were not determined solely by religious or political affiliation, but were influenced by the composition of society and the support and acceptance received by immigrants and traders therein. Through an analysis of the Franco-Irish case study, it is concluded here that the social context of mercantile activity was just as responsible as the political or religious climate in governing the development of international commercial relationships in this period.;2014;‘Such unjustificable practices’?: Irish trade, settlement, and society in France, 1688–1715;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
TANG, JOHN P.;Railroads in late nineteenth-century Japan are credited with facilitating factor mobility as well as access to human and financial capital, but their impact on firms has been unclear. Using a prefecture-level panel data set and a difference-in-differences model that exploits the temporal and spatial variation of railroad expansion, I investigate the relationship between railways and increased firm activity. Rail access led to higher average firm capitalization, particularly in manufacturing, and more populated and less accessible areas gained disproportionately more firms. By widening markets and allowing for agglomeration economies, Japanese railways promoted capital investment and more efficient resource allocation.;2014;Railroad Expansion and Industrialization: Evidence from Meiji Japan;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Thomasson, Melissa A.; Fishback, Price V.";We use 20th-century data to examine how community economic conditions at the time of birth influenced various measures of socioeconomic success as adults. Our analysis focuses on the worst downturn ever experienced in the United States: the Great Depression. We merge individual information reported by respondents in the U.S. Censuses of 1970 and 1980 with information on state per capita income during the individual's year of birth in their state of birth. Results indicate that the effect of state income per capita in the birth year on income and disability later in life varies with changes in income levels. Individuals born in the trough of the Depression in low-income states had substantially lower incomes and higher work disability rates later in life than workers born in those states in the peak year of 1929. However, the effect of being born during the trough of the Depression in states with higher incomes during the first half of the 20th century was much weaker on income and disability later in life.;2014;Hard times in the land of plenty: The effect on income and disability later in life for people born during the great depression;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Tomlinson, Jim;In Britain in the 1970s inflation rose to historically unprecedented peace-time levels, and became the central issue of economic policy-making. We know a great deal about the elite policy debates on the significance of this inflation, and the arguments about how to reduce it, but we know far less about how inflation was understood by the population at large, and how those understandings were shaped. This article explores the evidence on popular understanding, especially analysing the material gathered by the Counter-Inflation Publicity Unit, created in the summer of 1975. Along with other evidence, this material is used to explore how far the Labour government's economic propaganda can be said to have influenced popular opinion on both the significance and causes of inflation. The evidence supports the argument that the belief that trade unions were the main culprit for inflation was reinforced and entrenched by this propaganda, with important unintended consequences for the arguments about policy that followed the ?Winter of Discontent? of 1978/9.;2014;British government and popular understanding of inflation in the mid-1970s;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"van Bochove, C.; van Velzen, T.";Payday loans allow salaried workers to solve cash flow problems resulting from unexpected expenses or income drops. Lenders limit moral hazard risks by rationing loan sizes and terms, but with fixed costs this results in high APRs. How can wages provide more security and facilitate more favorable conditions? This paper considers the case of the Dutch East India Company (1602–1794) whose employees borrowed larger sums, for longer terms, and lower APRs. It shows how restricting employees' discretionary behavior helped solve moral hazard problems and how financial intermediaries enabled the large-scale use of loans.;2014;Loans to salaried employees: the case of the Dutch East India Company, 1602-1794;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
van Bochove, Christiaan;"External borrowing constituted an important part of sovereign finances in early modern Europe. As payments could not be enforced through third parties, sovereigns had to convince lenders of their commitment to service their loans. Although the literature has dealt with this problem extensively, little is known about what supported lending in early modern Europe. This article therefore asks whether and how commitment mechanisms identified in the sovereign borrowing literature made external borrowing safer in early modern Europe. It attempts to answer this question by analysing the loans that a small and peripheral state (Denmark) issued in Europe's foremost international investment hub (eighteenth-century Holland). Primary sources demonstrate that Denmark inspired confidence in investors and serviced its loans well; a new dataset with securities prices reveals yields to maturity in accordance with this. Economic spillovers (domestic economic damage) and reputation (loss of access to external loans) are identified as the mechanisms that kept the Danish sovereigns committed to honouring their debts. The Danish case shows, however, that these commitment mechanisms could only be adopted after the growth and integration of northern Europe's economies. This suggests that commitment mechanisms are not as universally applicable as the literature often seems to claim.";2014;External debt and commitment mechanisms: Danish borrowing in Holland, 1763–1825;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"van LOTTUM, JELLE; van Zanden, Jan Luiten";"Pre-modern growth was to a large extent dependent on processes of commercialization and specialization, based on cheap transport. Seminal interpretations of the process of economic growth before the Industrial Revolution have pointed to the strategic importance of the rise of the Atlantic economy and the growth of cities linked to this, but have not really explained why Europeans were so efficient in organizing large international networks of shipping and trade. Most studies concerning early modern shipping have focused on changes in ship design (capital investments) in explaining long-term performance of European shipping in the pre-1800 period; in this paper we argue that this is only part of the explanation. Human capital – the quality of the labour force employed on ships – mattered as well. We firstly demonstrate that levels of human capital on board European ships were relatively high, and secondly that there were powerful links between the level of labour productivity in shipping and the quality of the workforce. This suggests strongly that shipping was a ‘high tech’ industry not only employing high quality capital goods, but also, as a complementary input, high quality labour, which was required to operate the increasingly complex ships and their equipment.";2014;Labour productivity and human capital in the European maritime sector of the eighteenth century;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

By analysing a new dataset on the income and expenditure of five Dutch towns, we conclude that, despite the absence of uniform legislation, Dutch poor relief was viable at least up until the 1790s, even in times of severe crises and declining real wages. This was obtained by the – in monetary terms – remarkably stable donations by Dutch citizens, mostly through regular collections, as well as careful financial management of the charitable funds.;2014;The stability of voluntarism: financing social care in early modern Dutch towns compared with the English Poor Law, c. 1600-1800;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Vinnal, H.;A sample of merchant letters is used to measure the speed and reliability of information transmission at the end of the preindustrial era. Some previous informal studies suggested no improvements in information transmission in this period. The present study confirms this opinion. Considering technological capabilities, the communication between the major North and Baltic Sea region commercial centers was already relatively fast and remarkably regular in the 1750s and did not improve until the 1820s. The speed and reliability of transmission was limited on maritime postal routes, and by an inability to integrate the smaller trading centers into the national postal service network.;2014;The world refuses to shrink: the speed and reliability of information transmission in North and Baltic Sea region, 1750-1825;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Wanamaker, Marianne H.;Theories of the demographic transition often center on the rising price of children. A model of fertility derived from household production in the antebellum United States contains both own children and slaves as inputs. Changes in slaveholdings beget changes in the marginal product of the slaveowners’ own children and, hence, their price. I use panel data on slaveowning households between 1850 and 1870 to measure the slaveowners’ own fertility responses to exogenous changes in slaveholdings. Results indicate a strong, negative correlation between own child prices and fertility.;2014;Fertility and the Price of Children: Evidence from Slavery and Slave Emancipation;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Zegarra, Luis Felipe;This article examines the impact of legal and economic factors on the growth of commercial banking in Latin America in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Using annual data for five countries for the period 1840–1920, this article shows that growth in exports had a significant effect on the growth of bank liabilities (deposits plus note issues). For the most part, changes in banking laws did not have a significant effect on the development of banking. This latter result likely reflects heterogeneity in the meaning of changes, as well as the potential dominance of de facto political factors in shaping the importance of de jure legal changes.;2014;Bank laws, economic growth and early banking in Latin America: 1840–1920;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"ACHESON, GRAEME G.; CAMPBELL, GARETH; Turner, John D.; Vanteeva, Nadia";Using ownership and control data for 890 firm-years, this article examines the concentration of capital and voting rights in British companies in the second half of the nineteenth century. We find that both capital and voting rights were diffuse by modern-day standards. However, this does not necessarily mean that there was a modern-style separation of ownership from control in Victorian Britain. One major implication of our findings is that diffuse ownership was present in the UK much earlier than previously thought, and given that it occurred in an era with weak shareholder protection law, it somewhat undermines the influential law and finance hypothesis. We also find that diffuse ownership is correlated with large boards, a London head office, non-linear voting rights, and shares traded on multiple markets.;2015;Corporate ownership and control in Victorian Britain;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
ALFANI, GUIDO;This article provides a picture of economic inequality in northwestern Italy (Piedmont), 1300–1800. Regional studies of this kind are rare, and none has as long a timescale. The new data proposed illuminate little-known aspects of wealth distribution and general economic inequality in preindustrial times, supporting the idea that during the Early Modern period, inequality grew everywhere, independently from whether the economy was growing or stagnating. This challenges earlier views that explained inequality growth as the consequence of economic development.

Allen, Robert C.;This article responds to Humphries's critique of Allen's assessment of the high wage economy of eighteenth-century Britain and its importance for explaining the industrial revolution. New evidence is presented to show that women and children participated in the high wage economy. It is also shown that the high wage economy provides a good explanation of why the industrial revolution happened in the eighteenth century by showing that increases of women's wages around 1700 greatly increased the profitability of using spinning machinery. The relationship between the high wage economy of the eighteenth century and the inequality and poverty in Britain in the nineteenth century is explored.;2015;The high wage economy and the industrial revolution: a restatement;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

It exploits two new datasets on grain prices. The degree of market integration is estimated using a wavelet variant of dynamic factor analysis that takes account of both time and distance. Additionally, we use the London corn market as the benchmark for the degree of market integration. Our results show that the role of distance disappeared in the wheat and rye, but not in the oats and barley trade, as the Baltic Sea Region became integrated into the Atlantic economy.;2015;Grain Market Integration in the Baltic Sea Region in the Nineteenth Century;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

As predicted on the basis of the contemporary literature on crowding-out effects, we find that the compulsory pension reduced the demand for life insurance.

Our dataset is based on official quotation lists of the stock exchange, and it takes into account all common stocks that were ever listed on the stock exchange during the period considered. This allows us to investigate the performance of the market as a whole in a consistent way over the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. We find that stock returns strongly depend on dividend income. While real capital appreciation tends to be negative, the dividend yield is remarkably stable over time. Stocks were less risky in the nineteenth century than in the twentieth century. While the equity premium is overall positive, the reward for equity risk is very volatile over time. Even in the long-run equity investors frequently earned a negative return.

"Baffigi, Alberto; Bontempi, Maria Elena; FELICE, EMANUELE; Golinelli, Roberto";The article investigates the relationship between GDP and prices in Italy in the long-run, from the country's Unification (1861) up to present day. By using the new national accounts data, over the period 1861–2012, we were able to make Italy the third country to have a historical test of the hybrid Phillips curve (in which both the new Keynesian and the backward-looking Phillips curves are tested), together with the UK and the US. How do economic growth and prices interact in Italy's different stages of economic growth? Unlike the US and the UK, where said interaction was already operating in mid-19th century, in Italy the link between inflation and the economic cycle emerged only after the First World War. We argue that this can be explained owing to Italy's different position in the international economic system and the way foreign conditioning factors (the exchange-rate regime and innovation in transportation) influenced the Italian industrialization. Before the First World War, deflation was imported. This turned out to be compatible with some GDP growth, insofar as the deflationist macroeconomic setting favoured capital inflows and technological upgrading. Whereas, from the First World War until the creation of a common European currency, price variations were mainly a consequence of national policies and domestic conditions: the trade-off with the GDP cycle is now manifest, both in the periods of deflation (the interwar years) and in those of inflation (the second half of the twentieth century). Our findings may also have important implications for present day, since price movements are once again, as in the liberal age, largely imported.;2015;The changing relationship between inflation and the economic cycle in Italy: 1861–2012;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Baker, Richard B.;I examine how production of a child labor–intensive crop (cotton) affected schooling in the early twentieth-century American South. Because cotton production may be endogenous, presence of an agricultural pest (the boll weevil) is employed as an instrument. Using newly collected county-level data for Georgia, I find a 10 percent reduction in cotton caused a 2 percent increase in black enrollment rate, but had little effect on white enrollment. The shift away from cotton following the boll weevil's arrival explains 30 percent of the narrowing of the racial differential in enrollment rates between 1914 and 1929.;2015;From the Field to the Classroom: The Boll Weevil's Impact on Education in Rural Georgia;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Baten, Jörg; Fourie, Johan";The lack of accurate measures of human capital formation often constrains investigations into the long-run determinants of growth and comparative economic development, especially in the developing world. Using the reported ages of criminals in the Court of Justice records in the Cape Archives, this article documents for the first time numeracy levels and trends for inhabitants of the Cape Colony born between the late seventeenth and early nineteenth century: the native Khoesan, European settlers, and imported slaves from other African regions and Asia. This variety of origins allows us to compare contemporaneous levels of early modern development across three continents. By isolating those slaves born at the Cape, we also provide a glimpse into the dynamics of human capital transfer in a colonial setting. The Colony's relatively high level of human capital overall had implications for what was later to be the richest country on African soil, but the very unequal attainment of numeracy also foreshadowed extreme income inequality.;2015;Numeracy of Africans, Asians, and Europeans during the early modern period: new evidence from Cape Colony court registers;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Bean, Jessica S.;"Most prior work on historical female labour supply has been confined to looking at the female labour force participation decision. This article uses the detailed information on weekly hours of work and wages contained in the New Survey of London Life and Labour (NSLLL) (1928?32) to provide the first estimation of both the participation and the hours-of-work decisions for female workers prior to the Second World War. The main finding is that the labour supply curve was negatively sloped?women worked longer hours at lower wages. It is also possible to compare the determinants of the labour force participation decision and the hours of work decision among females in the NSLLL. It appears that the labour force participation decision was more strongly related to household income level than to own wages, while the hours of work decision among working women was more strongly related to the wage level than to household income. Finally, the article also examines the differential labour market behaviour of married women, female household heads, and young single women; most striking among these results is the evident added-worker effect on married women of the onset of the Great Depression in 1930.";2015;‘To help keep the home going’: female labour supply in interwar London;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Our new spatial output indexes show that 16 to 21 percent of the increase in U.S. corn output over the 128 years beginning in 1879 was attributable to spatial movement in production.

Beltrán Tapia, Francisco J.;Biological living standards stagnated or even declined during the transition to modern economic growth. Although income per capita was increasing, other indicators, such as mortality rates or heights, portrayed a completely different image. This paper adds to the standard of living debate by analysing the potential effect of the privatisation of common lands. Although highly controversial regarding its impact on the modernisation process itself, its contribution to human welfare has somewhat received much less attention. Focusing on the Spanish experience, this paper exploits geographical variation over time by collecting a panel data set at the provincial level on three different periods: 1860, 1900 and 1930. The empirical analysis shows that the persistence of these collective resources is related with higher life expectancy and heights, particularly during the second half of the nineteenth century. Biological human welfare also seems to have been negatively influenced by the progressively decreasing role that local communities played on the management of these resources. The survival of common lands in some regions provided peasants with mechanisms different from the market, thus making the transition to a market economy more socially sustainable.;2015;Commons and the standard of living debate in Spain, 1860–1930;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Bengtsson, Erik;An influential interpretation of the strong growth performance in Western Europe in the 1950s and 1960s stresses the importance of wage restraint, trade unions holding back wages to increase investments. This article questions that interpretation, using a wage regression approach with eighty-five to ninety-six years of data on wages, inflation, unemployment, productivity, and other variables in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, focusing on the post-1950 period. It is shown that wages in fact increased faster than productivity in Sweden in the 1950s and 1960s and in Denmark and Norway in the 1960s. On the other hand, especially Denmark and Sweden saw wage restraint in the 1980s and 1990s. Overall the results of the article support a power-oriented interpretation of wage bargaining rather than the conventional postwar wage restraint story.

"Bignon, V.; Esteves, Rui Pedro; Herranz-Loncán, Alfonso";Railways were one of the main engines of the Latin American trade boom before 1914. Railway construction often required financial support from local governments, which depended on their fiscal capacity. However, since the main government revenues were trade-related, this generated a two-way feedback between government revenues and railways, with a potential for multiple equilibria. The empirical tests in this article support the hypothesis of such a positive two-way relationship. The main implication of our analysis is that the build-up of state capacity was a necessary condition for railway expansion and also, to a large extent, for export expansion in Latin America during the first globalization.;2015;Big push or big grab?

Blakeway, Amy;This article contributes to the emerging belief among early modern economic historians that sixteenth-century inflation was primarily caused by monetary factors. The Scottish case study reveals a strong relationship between coinage debasement and rising prices, a contention strengthened by the fact that the Scottish experience of inflation was high in European terms, and, in particular, stands at a considerable distance from the English pattern. This study includes the first scholarly examination of prices during the 1540s, and reveals that substantial inflation first emerged during this hitherto neglected decade. Prices plateaued during the 1550s, and rose consistently from 1560 to 1585. Meanwhile real wages declined during the 1540s and from 1560 onwards. This article is methodologically innovative in constructing two baskets of commodities, designed to represent the elite experience, alongside a more traditional basket based on a working household. These reveal the divergent experiences of the price rise within Scotland: rising prices hit the poor harder than the rich due to the high cost of domestic agricultural goods in the subsistence basket and the deflationary impact of wages and luxury goods upon the overall elite basket.;2015;The sixteenth-century price rise: new evidence from Scotland, 1500–85;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Bordo, Michael D.; Redish, Angela; Rockoff, Hugh";The financial crisis of 2008 engulfed the banking system of the US and many large European countries. Canada was a notable exception. In this article we argue that the structure of financial systems is path-dependent. The relative stability of the Canadian banks in the recent crisis compared to the US in our view reflected the original institutional foundations laid in place in the early nineteenth century in the two countries. The Canadian concentrated banking system that had evolved by the end of the twentieth century had absorbed the key sources of systemic risk?the mortgage market and investment banking?and was tightly regulated by one overarching regulator. In contrast, the relatively weak, fragmented, and crisis-prone US banking system that had evolved since the early nineteenth century led to the rise of securities markets, investment banks, and money market mutual funds (the shadow banking system) combined with multiple competing regulatory authorities. The consequence was that the systemic risk that led to the crisis of 2007?8 was not contained.;2015;Why didn't Canada have a banking crisis in 2008 (or in 1930, or 1907, or …)?;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Broadberry, Stephen N.; Custodis, Johann; Gupta, Bishnupriya";Estimates of Indian GDP are constructed from the output side for 1600–1871, and combined with population data. Indian per capita GDP declined steadily during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries before stabilising during the nineteenth century. As British growth increased from the mid-seventeenth century, India fell increasingly behind. Whereas in 1600, Indian per capita GDP was over 60% of the British level, by 1871 it had fallen to less than 15%. These estimates place the origins of the Great Divergence firmly in the early modern period, but also suggest a relatively prosperous India at the height of the Mughal Empire. They also suggest a period of “strong” deindustrialisation during the first three decades of the nineteenth century, with a small decline of industrial output rather than just a declining share of industry in economic activity.;2015;India and the great divergence: An Anglo-Indian comparison of GDP per capita, 1600–1871;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

We use the English wheat market, 1750–1914, as an example to quantify this issue. First, we show that bushel weight approximates grain quality. Then we show that cross sectional and intra-year variation are substantial and problematic, generating erroneous inference regarding market integration. Long run variation is significant, due to sharply declining international quality differentials, and this impacts estimated cost of living changes. By contrast, inter-year variation is smaller and controlled for more easily.;2015;Variations in the price and quality of English grain, 1750–1914: Quantitative evidence and empirical implications;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Burnette, Joyce;This article tests for wage discrimination in US manufacturing during the nineteenth century and in 2002 by estimating the female-to-male productivity ratio and comparing it to the wage ratio. This method will not identify all forms of discrimination, but will determine whether women were paid wages commensurate with their productivity. There was no significant difference between the wage ratio and the productivity ratio in the nineteenth century, but in 1900 there is evidence of gender discrimination among white-collar workers. In 2002 the female-to-male productivity ratio was higher than in the nineteenth century, and the wage ratio was also higher, but the wage ratio was significantly lower than the productivity ratio, at least for workers older than thirty-five.

Despite this, little is known about how ordinary individual investors managed risk within this framework. Using a newly constructed dataset of share ownership for those joint-stock companies listed in the financial press of the day, we reconstruct individual portfolio holdings for investors in these companies. We examine individual portfolio holdings first for the decade after the Glorious Revolution and then for the years around the South Sea Bubble. Despite a fivefold increase in the number of unique individuals in the market between the 1690s and the 1720s, we find that in each period roughly 80 per cent of those active in the equity market held shares in only one company, even though many shareholders had the capacity or wealth to diversify share portfolios. These outcomes suggest diversification against idiosyncratic liquidity risk. Overall, however, there is limited evidence that individuals were using their financial portfolios to protect against diversifiable shocks. For many, we argue, company-specific voting and firm governance rules drove market activity.;2015;Share portfolios in the early years of financial capitalism: London, 1690–1730;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Caruana-Galizia, Paul;What if a colony is neither extractive nor settler material? European powers colonized some areas for military reasons: to keep those areas out of rivals' hands or to have geographically strategic outposts. In these cases, European settlement was low and there was nothing to extract. This article examines the extent to which living standards, as measured by real wages, among three such examples?Cyprus, Gibraltar, and Malta?can be explained by British rule. These highly comparable Mediterranean islands did not enjoy democratic governments nor did they endure authoritarian ones. Colonial institutions worked through ensuring an environment in which Mediterranean trade could flourish. This adds another layer to our understanding of the economic impact of colonization, extending the simple settler versus extractive dichotomy. It also contradicts the historiography's claims that living standards were low, and determined by British military expenditure. Living standards in these countries were in fact at the European average.;2015;Strategic colonies and economic development: real wages in Cyprus, Gibraltar, and Malta, 1836–1913;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Cha, Myung Soo;This study calculates the cost of subsistence and respectability consumption baskets to derive ?welfare ratios? for 11 cities in the Japanese Empire as defined by Allen and his colleagues. Nominal wages tended to be higher where higher prices prevailed, and vice versa. Prices and nominal wages remained highest in Japan and lowest in Manchuria, with Korea and Taiwan being placed in between. Welfare ratios remained roughly comparable in the 1910s in the imperial cities outside Manchuria, where unskilled workers enjoyed substantially higher living standards. Interwar decades saw real wages rise in Tokyo, but fall in Dalian, which caused convergence in workers' income levels. Wage divergence occurred within Manchuria, as workers in Shenyang and Changchun enjoyed an improving welfare ratio. Real wages rose more slowly in Korean and Taiwanese than in Japanese cities. Replacing a subsistence lifestyle with a ?respectable? lifestyle yields a significantly different picture of the evolution of the real wage gap within the empire, which contradicts findings reported by existing studies in important respects.;2015;Unskilled wage gaps within the Japanese Empire;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Chaney, Eric;This paper uses data on more than 4000 captives ransomed from the Barbary corsairs to track the military power of the Ottoman Empire's most powerful North African regency over time. Results suggest that as the seventeenth century advanced, Algerian-based corsairs found it increasingly difficult to capture “hard” targets. These results do not appear to be driven by changes in ransoming preferences or by other unobserved factors and provide insights into both the timing and reasons behind the military decline of the Western Islamic World.;2015;Measuring the military decline of the Western Islamic World: Evidence from Barbary ransoms;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Chaudhary, Latika; Garg, Manuj";Can good policy overcome or alter the effects of history? This question is addressed in this article using unique district-level data for 148 districts of former British India. Controlling for observable differences in geography and income, the ordinary least squares estimates suggest a large and positive effect of colonial expenditures on rural primary education in 1911 on rural literacy up to 1991. However, instrumental variable estimates that control for the endogeneity of colonial investments suggest that the effects of historical spending are significant only up to 1971. Two policy changes can account for these findings: an increase in spending following the 1968 National Education Policy and a greater emphasis on the universal provision of public goods such as schools in the 1970s. Unlike recent studies documenting the persistent effects of historical investments on contemporary outcomes, this study emphasizes how effective policies can overturn the effects of history.;2015;Does history matter?

The persistence of status follows a pronounced, robust U-shaped pattern, falling among cohorts educated following the Communist revolution of 1949, and rising among cohorts educated following the reforms of the late 1970s. The pattern is not driven by the Cultural Revolution or by changing associations between education and income. The U-shape also appears in complementary datasets covering rural China.

"Chilosi, David; Federico, Giovanni";This paper contributes to the debate on globalization and the great divergence with a comprehensive analysis of the integration of Asia in the world market from 1800 to the eve of World War II. We examine the patterns of convergence in prices for a wide range of commodities between Europe and the main Asian countries (India, Indonesia, Japan and China) and we compare them with convergence between Europe and the East Coast of the United States, hitherto the yardstick for the 19th century. Most price convergence occurred before 1870, mainly as a consequence of the abolition of the European trading monopolies with Asia, and, to a lesser extent, the repeal of duties on Atlantic trade. After 1870, price differentials continued to decline thanks to falling freights and to better communication after the lay-out of telegraph cables. There was only little disintegration in the inter-war years.;2015;Early globalizations: The integration of Asia in the world economy, 1800–1938;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"CICCARELLI, CARLO; Nuvolari, Alessandro";The locomotive industry was one of the relatively sophisticated “high tech” sectors in which Italy, a late industrializer, was successful before 1913. Using technical data on the performance of different vintages of locomotives, we construct a new industry-level index of technical change. We also study the impact of different policy instruments (import duties, non-tariff trade barriers, and other discretionary interventions) in shaping the development of the industry. Our reassessment reveals not only the sound technological performance of Italian locomotives and successful industry growth, but also the critical role played by non-tariff barriers for the development of the industry.;2015;Technical Change, Non-Tariff Barriers, and the Development of the Italian Locomotive Industry, 1850–1913;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Clark, Gregory;England from 1200 to 1600 was a society caught in apparent technological stasis, typical of the pre-industrial world. Many believe this pre-industrial stagnation was the result of political and cultural constraints, such as those on the operation of markets. Indeed medieval English law outlawed many arbitrage activities in markets. The paper shows using information of grain yields and prices at 227 different locations that the most important of all markets, that for grain, was nevertheless both extensive and relatively efficient as early as 1209. Whatever the rhetoric of medieval law and social thought the real effect of constraints on the operation the grain market seems to have been minimal. England had an elaborate market economy at least 500 years before it had sustained economic growth.;2015;Markets before economic growth: the grain market of medieval England;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Clark, Gregory; Cummins, Neil; Hao, Yu; Vidal, Dan Diaz";This paper explains how surname distributions can be used as a way to measure rates of social mobility in contemporary and historical societies. This allows for estimates of social mobility rates for any population for which we know just two facts: the distribution of surnames overall, and the distribution of surnames among some elite or underclass. Such information exists, for example, for England back to 1300, and for Sweden back to 1700. However surname distributions reveal a different, more fundamental type of mobility than that conventionally estimated. Thus surname estimates also allow for measuring a different aspect of social mobility, the underlying average social status of families. This is the aspect that matters for mobility of social groups, and for families across multiple generations.;2015;Surnames: A new source for the history of social mobility;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Collins, William J.; Wanamaker, Marianne H.";We construct datasets of linked census records to study internal migrants' selection and destination choices during the first decades of the “Great Migration” (1910–1930). We study both whites and blacks and intra- and inter-regional migration. While there is some evidence of positive selection, the degree of selection was small and participation in migration was widespread. Differences in background, including initial location, cannot account for racial differences in destination choices. Blacks and whites were similarly responsive to pre-existing migrant stocks from their home state, but black men were more deterred by distance, attracted to manufacturing, and responsive to labor demand.;2015;The Great Migration in Black and White: New Evidence on the Selection and Sorting of Southern Migrants;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Colvin, Christopher L.; Jong, Abe de; Fliers, Philip T.";Why do some banks fail in financial crises while others survive? This article answers this question by analysing the effect of the Dutch financial crisis of the 1920s on 142 banks, of which 33 failed. We find that choices of balance sheet composition and product market strategy made in the lead-up to the crisis had a significant impact on banks' subsequent chances of experiencing distress. We document that high-risk banks – those operating highly-leveraged portfolios and attracting large quantities of deposits – were more likely to fail. Branching and international activities also increased banks' default probabilities. We measure the effects of board interlocks, which have been characterized in the extant literature as contributing to the Dutch crisis. We find that boards mattered: failing banks had smaller boards, shared directors with smaller and very profitable banks and had a lower concentration of interlocking directorates in non-financial firms.;2015;Predicting the past: Understanding the causes of bank distress in the Netherlands in the 1920s;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Costa, Leonor Freire; Palma, Nuno; REIS, JAIME";Newly assembled macroeconomic statistics for early modern Portugal reveal one of Europe's most vigorous colonial traders but one of its least successful growth records. Was the empire a blessing or a drag to the economy? Using an estimated dynamic model, we conclude that intercontinental trade had a substantial and increasingly positive impact on economic growth. In the heyday of colonial expansion, eliminating the economic links to empire would have reduced Portugal's per capita income by at least a fifth. While the empire helped the domestic economy, it was not sufficient to annul the tendency of the latter toward decline in relation to Europe's advanced core, which began to set in from the seventeenth century onward, but only became definite after 1800. We conclude that the explanation for Portugal's long-term backwardness must be sought primarily in domestic conditions.;2015;The great escape?

Cox, Gary W.;"The difficulty sovereign actors face in making their promises credible is widely appreciated (e.g., North and Weingast ; Myerson ). In this article, I argue that the English repeatedly used institutions of monopoly brokerage to mediate trades between the sovereign (offering various promises) and subjects (offering revenues). Once set up—at different times in different markets—institutions of monopoly brokerage sparked substantial and abrupt growth in state revenues. Moreover, these revenue increases cannot be explained by changes in promise-holders’ ability to punish nonperformance, changes in the preferences of pivotal state decision makers, or changes in high constitutional structure alone.";2015;Marketing Sovereign Promises: The English Model;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Cox, Mary Elisabeth;At the onset of the First World War, Germany was subject to a shipping embargo by the Allied forces. Ostensibly military in nature, the blockade prevented not only armaments but also food and fertilizers from entering Germany. The impact of that blockade on civilian populations has been debated ever since. Germans protested that the Allies had wielded hunger as a weapon against women and children with devastating results, a claim that was hotly denied by the Allies. The impact of what the Germans termed the Hungerblockade on childhood nutrition can now be assessed using a newly discovered dataset based on heights and weights of nearly 600,000 German schoolchildren measured between 1914 and 1924. Statistical analysis reveals a grim truth: German children suffered severe malnutrition due to the blockade. Social class impacted risk of deprivation, with working-class children suffering the most. Surprisingly, they were the quickest to recover after the war. Their rescue was fuelled by massive food aid organized by the former enemies of Germany, and delivered cooperatively with both government and civil society. The ability of former belligerents to work together after an exceptionally bitter war to feed impoverished children may hold hope for the future.;2015;Hunger games: or how the Allied blockade in the First World War deprived German children of nutrition, and Allied food aid subsequently saved them;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Crafts, Nicolas F. R.; Mills, Terence C.";Self-defeating austerity entails “perverse effects” of fiscal consolidation such that fiscal indicators deteriorate. Inter alia, this depends on the size of the fiscal multiplier as Keynes (1933. The Means to Prosperity. London: Macmillan) underlined. We find that the government-expenditure multiplier was less than 1 in 1930s' Britain. Austerity was not self-defeating in the long run and even its initial impact probably did not raise the public debt-to-GDP ratio. In the later 1930s, there was a “fiscal free lunch” in that deficit-financed government spending would have improved public finances enough to pay for the interest on the extra debt.;2015;Self-defeating austerity?

It is demonstrated that (1) although the relative price of gold returned to its prewar level the adjustment was driven by differences between countries rather than the absolute deviation from the prewar level; (2) mutually inconsistent monetary policies of major central banks were important for deflation dynamics.";2015;Did the Great Deflation of 1929–33 really have to happen?

Analyses of high-frequency 3 percent consol yield data and historical financial press suggest three conclusions. First, democratic reform episodes were preceded by increases in perceived political risk, comparable to democratizing episodes in other countries. Second, both democratic reform and repression were followed by yield declines. Third, the source of political risk in Britain was both social unrest and political deadlock. Together, the findings challenge the “Whig” characterization of British democratization as exceptionally risk-free.;2015;How Did Britain Democratize?

Delis, Apostolos;Wooden shipbuilding represented a very important economic activity in Greece during the nineteenth century, and it was strictly related to the growth of the Greek-owned merchant marine. Particularly in Hermoupolis of Syros, a major commercial and shipping center of the same period, wooden shipbuilding experienced unprecedented rates of growth, helping it to become one of the major shipbuilding centers of the Mediterranean. The article examines whether this activity can be characterized as the first industry of Modern Greece before the introduction of the factory system. The analysis includes an overview of the level of industrialization during the period 1830–70, the conditions of the establishment and growth of wooden shipbuilding in Hermoupolis, its occurrence at a national and international level, its contribution to the local and national economy, and last but not least, the specific aspects that may perhaps be seen as factors in the “industrialization” of a craft-based activity.;2015;Modern Greece's first industry?

The data are unique in that they allow to directly measure in-migration and out-migration at the level of individual villages and towns. The results show that contrary to the powerful image of a push-driven rural exodus, it was not the villages hardest hit by the crisis that recorded the highest levels of migration. Rather, in-migration and out-migration rates often moved in tandem, and were determined primarily by existing migration traditions.;2015;Rural crisis and rural exodus?

"DOBADO-GONZÁLEZ, RAFAEL; GARCÍA-HIERNAUX, ALFREDO; GUERRERO, DAVID E.";"This paper addresses two important topics in recent economic historiography: globalization and the great divergence. We first present a search for statistical evidence in the Far East of an “Early Globalization” comparable to the one ongoing in the West since the mid-eighteenth century. Moreover, we analyze the extent of the integration of rice markets in Central southeast China and Japan during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and its functioning in comparison with Western countries. Finally, the relevance of our findings for the debate on the great divergence is discussed. Our primary conclusions are as follows: (1) in contrast to the West, no international integration of the grain markets existed in the Far East during the Early Modern Era; (2) significant levels of domestic market integration were reached in some Far Eastern countries; (3) integration of the domestic grain markets may be reached through various combinations of agents and policies with dissimilar effects on long-run economic growth, which are better in the West and worse in the Far East. We suggest that the absence of an “Early Globalization” in the Far East reveals the existence of certain economic and institutional limitations in this part of the world that may have made contribution to its “Great Divergence” with the West from at least the eighteenth century.";2015;West versus Far East: early globalization and the great divergence;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Drelichman, Mauricio; Voth, Hans-Joachim";Contingent sovereign debt can create important welfare gains. Nonetheless, there is almost no issuance today. Using hand-collected archival data, we examine the first known case of large-scale use of state-contingent sovereign debt in history. Philip II of Spain entered into hundreds of contracts whose value and due date depended on verifiable, exogenous events such as the arrival of silver fleets. We show that this allowed for effective risk sharing between the king and his bankers. The existence of state-contingent debt also sheds light on the nature of defaults—they were simply contingencies over which Crown and bankers had not contracted previously.;2015;Risk sharing with the monarch: contingent debt and excusable defaults in the age of Philip II, 1556–1598;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Du Plessis, Sophia; Jansen, Ada; Fintel, Dieter von";This paper analyses the economic viability of slavery in the Cape Colony in southern Africa. It has been extensively documented that the affluence of elites was built on the importation of slaves. However, the Dutch East India Company or Verengide Oost-indische Companje, which administrated the colony, expressed concerns that free settlers had invested too much capital in the trade, so that some indications exist that profitability was not certain for all farmers. In this paper, hedonic slave price indices and the value of their marginal productivity have been estimated, to construct annual returns, which are in turn compared with returns on other investments for the period 1700–1725. Hedonic price functions were estimated to remove the anticipated lifetime returns that slaves would yield and to isolate buyers’ perceived depreciation of the slave for 1 year. Cobb–Douglas production functions were estimated for average farmers, as well as at various quintiles along the distribution, to evaluate scale effects. Large farmers enjoyed high returns to slavery over most of the period, confirming the assertions that the elite used slaves profitably. Small farmers, however, did not recoup slave costs from agricultural production: this suggests either that they overinvested in slavery relative to other capital goods (e.g. ploughs or wagons), or that they used slaves profitably outside of agriculture.;2015;Slave prices and productivity at the Cape of Good Hope from 1700 to 1725: Did everyone win from the trade?;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Edvinsson, Rodney Benjamin;The world population growth increased in the eighteenth century, which caused real wages to decline in most countries. Eli Heckscher held the view that Swedish population growth was quite low in the seventeenth century, similar to the development in the rest of Europe, and that there was a substantial acceleration after 1720. Recent data for Sweden by Lennart Andersson Palm entail that population growth was stronger in the seventeenth century than in the eighteenth century. However, this is at variance with other types of economic data. For example, Swedish real wages increased during the seventeenth century and fell in the eighteenth century. This study attempts to resolve the anomaly and argues that Palm’s estimates of Swedish population and mortality rates are too low for the seventeenth century. It presents revised annual demographic data for Sweden for the pre-census period, back to 1630. The new data indicate that there was a small acceleration in early modern population growth, due to the decreased occurrence of mortality crises, but the acceleration was not as pronounced as in the rest of the world.;2015;Recalculating Swedish pre-census demographic data: Was there acceleration in early modern population growth?;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

We present data on accommodation operations through which Reserve Banks mutualized gold reserves in emergency situations between 1913 and 1960. Reserve sharing was important in response to liquidity crises and bank runs. Such cooperation was essential for the cohesion of the U.S. monetary union. But fortunes could change, with emergency recipients of gold becoming providers. Because imbalances did not endlessly grow, instead narrowing when region-specific shocks subsided, mutual assistance created only limited tensions.

"Enflo, Kerstin; Rosés, Joan Ramón";In many countries, regional income inequality has followed an inverted U-shaped curve, growing during industrialization and market integration and declining thereafter. By contrast, Sweden's regional inequality dropped from 1860 to 1980 and did not exhibit this U-shaped pattern. Accordingly, today's regional income inequality in Sweden is lower than in other European countries. We note that the prime mover behind the long-run reduction in regional income differentials was structural change, whereas neoclassical and technological forces played a relatively less important role. However, this process of regional income convergence can be divided into three major periods. During the first period (1860?1940), the unrestricted action of market forces, particularly the expansion of markets and high rates of internal and international migration, led to the compression of regional income differentials. During the next period (1940?80), regional convergence was even more intense. In this period, institutional arrangements favoured the reduction of productivity differentials across industries and successive governments aided the reallocation of the workforce from declining to thriving regions and economic sectors. During the last period (1980?2000), when regional incomes diverged, internal migration and structural change slowed. Furthermore, the development of knowledge-intensive service industries favoured economic growth in the main metropolitan areas.;2015;Coping with regional inequality in Sweden: structural change, migrations, and policy, 1860–2000;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Espuelas, Sergio;It is often assumed that the fight against inequality played an important role in the rise of the welfare state. However, using social transfers as an indicator of redistribution and three alternative proxies for inequality?the top income shares, the ratio of the GDP per capita to the unskilled wage, and the share of non-family farms?this article shows that inequality did not favour the development of social policy between 1880 and 1930. On the contrary, social policy developed more easily in countries that were previously more egalitarian, suggesting that unequal societies were in a sort of inequality trap, where inequality itself was an obstacle to redistribution.;2015;The inequality trap.

"Federico, Giovanni; Vasta, Michelangelo";The impact of protection on economic growth has enjoyed a revival in recent times, with the publication of a number of comparative quantitative papers. They all share a common weakness: they measure protection as the ratio of custom revenues to import value, which biases results if demand for imports is not perfectly inelastic. In this article, we show that the measure of protection matters. We estimate the James Anderson and Peter Neary (2005) Trade Restrictiveness Index for Italy from unification to the Great Depression. We suggest a different interpretation of some key moments of Italian trade policy and we show that the aggregate welfare losses were small in the long run and mostly related to protection on sugar in the 1880s and 1890s. We document that using different measures of protection affects results of the causal relation between trade policy on economic growth in Italy and in the United States. Accordingly, we argue that a systematic re-estimating of protection in the economic history of trade policy is needed.;2015;What Do We Really Know about Protection before the Great Depression: Evidence from Italy;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"FELICE, EMANUELE; Vasta, Michelangelo";The article presents and discusses estimates of social and economic indicators for Italy and its regions in benchmark years roughly from Unification to the present day: life expectancy, education, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita at purchasing power parity, and the new Human Development Index (HDI). A broad interpretative hypothesis, based on the distinction between “active” and “passive” modernization, is proposed to account for the evolution of regional imbalances. In the lack of active modernization, Southern Italy converged thanks to passive modernization. However, this was more effective in life expectancy, less successful in education, expensive, and as a whole ineffective in GDP. As a consequence, convergence in the HDI occurred from the late nineteenth century to the 1970s, but came to a sudden halt in the last decades of the twentieth century.;2015;Passive modernization?

FENOALTEA, STEFANO;"In the literature the (Italian) engineering industry is seen as one that transformed metal into machines; its time path is inferred from that of its consumption of metal. Newly recovered evidence indicates that far more metal was turned into (traditional) hardware than into (modern) machines. Machine production grew rapidly from a very small base: metal consumption fails to capture this change in the product mix, and understates the growth of new production at constant prices. Moreover, maintenance activity was in general as significant as new production. Maintenance was labor-intensive rather than metal-intensive, trend-dominated rather than cyclical, and relatively larger, next to new production, in 1861 than in 1913: metal consumption overstates the growth rate of the industry’s total product at constant prices, and much overstates its cyclical volatility. Technical progress was negligible in maintenance, but rapid in new production: constant-price-weighted physical measures fail to capture productivity growth, and even late-weighted series overstate the growth of the industry’s real product. These results are not tied to conditions peculiar to pre-War Italy: the new estimates presented here pave the way for emending, or at least reevaluating, the engineering-industry product series reconstructed for other times or places.";2015;The measurement of production movements: Lessons from the general engineering industry in Italy, 1861–1913;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Fernihough, Alan; Ó Gráda, Cormac; Walsh, Brendan M.";This paper explores the characteristics associated with marriages between Roman Catholics and members of other religious denominations in Ireland before the Great War. Using the entire digitized returns of the 1911 population census, we find that such marriages were relatively rare, occurring in less than 1% of total marriages. Some of this infrequency can be attributed to ethno-religious hostility—especially in the north of the country. However, we also show that the rarity of intermarriage reflects local marriage markets, as non-Roman Catholics living in communities with fewer coreligionists were more likely to intermarry. We examine the individual characteristics of partners in these marriages, looking at the religious denomination of their children, their decision to marry out, and their fertility behavior. Our findings illustrate how the frequency of intermarriage reflects historical levels of intolerance, but only after local marriage market conditions have been accounted for.;2015;Intermarriage in a divided society: Ireland a century ago;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The point estimates for nonfarm grants are higher and for AAA farm grants are much smaller and negative in some cases. The spending led to increase in durable good spending on automobiles but had no positive effects on private employment.;2015;The Multiplier for Federal Spending in the States During the Great Depression;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Fleissig, Adrian R.; Whitney, Gerald A.";A key criteria in measuring the true cost of living is the absence of non-price rationing. To examine how non-price rationing distorts conventional measures of the cost of living, we examine the case of Belgium following WWI. The economic fallout from WWI to Belgium was so severe that the Commission for Relief in Belgium provided considerable assistance after the war ended. Nonetheless, food shortages persisted even after international assistance ceased in 1919 and production in Belgium did not return to pre-war levels until the end of 1924. A nonparametric revealed preference test for fifteen food categories shows shortages for eggs, butter, potatoes, vegetables, and sugar for periods from 1920 to 1924. Estimated virtual prices for these five foods, in conjunction with actual prices for the other ten goods, show that the actual cost of living was severely underestimated. The virtual prices of these five goods are the prices at which consumers would have willingly paid to purchase them, given the observed quantities, along with their other purchases. In this respect they can be viewed as market clearing prices. Our findings reinforce the view that Belgium's population continued to endure the effects of constrained consumption and a lower standard of living after the war ended. Further the results show how much the welfare of the Belgium people improved when shortages began to decrease.;2015;Belgium relief fund, post war food shortages and the “True” cost of living;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Despite the possibilities that companies were created for fraud and exploitation, countries using the corporate form more extensively before 1914 had higher GDP per capita. Through this process, the benefit of imperialism extended to British dominions, but not much, if at all, to British dependent colonies.;2015;The diffusion and impact of the corporation in 1910;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
French, Henry;"Nearly every conceivable aspect of the old poor law in England appears to have been studied. Yet some fundamental questions about parish-level provisioning remain hard to answer. These include the amount that people received from the parish, from all sources, each week; how the balance between types of payments shifted over the period, and (correspondingly) within the individual life-course; the range of services or supplements that such individuals received, from the parish, over the course of their lives; and how this spectrum of relief adjusted to the massive macro-level changes that we know occurred in the poor relief system between the 1760s and 1834. This study attempts to answer these questions in new depth, by employing a dataset that encompasses all payments to named individuals within the Essex parish of Terling between 1762 and 1834, totalling 143,801 payments to 1,508 recipients. Analysis of this dataset provides new insights into the size, scope, changes, and significance of poor relief in labouring families' lives in southern England in this period.";2015;An irrevocable shift: detailing the dynamics of rural poverty in southern England, 1762–1834: a case study;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Gazeley, Ian; NEWELL, ANDREW";This article re-examines the food consumption of working-class households in 1904 and compares the nutritional content of these diets with modern measures of adequacy. We find a fairly steep gradient of nutritional attainment relative to economic class, with high levels of vitamin and mineral deficiency among the very poorest working households. However, we conclude that the average unskilled-headed working household was better fed and nourished than previously thought. When proper allowance is made for the likely consumption of alcohol, household energy intakes were significantly higher still. We investigate the likely impact of contemporary cultural food distribution norms and conclude on the basis of the very limited evidence available that women may have received, on average, about 80 per cent of a man's share of the available food. We adjust energy requirements for likely higher physical activity rates and smaller stature and find that except among the poorest households, early twentieth-century diets were sufficient to provide energy for reasonably physically demanding work. These results are consistent with recent attempts to relate the available anthropometric evidence to long-run trends in food consumption. We also find that the lower tail of the household nutrition distribution drops away very rapidly, so that few households are estimated to have suffered severe food shortages.;2015;Urban working-class food consumption and nutrition in Britain in 1904;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"GEARY, FRANK; Stark, Tom";This article compares the Geary?Stark method for distributing known GDP totals across regions with a variation suggested by Crafts. Tests of the Geary?Stark method confirm that it generates accurate estimates of regional GDP. There are practical and conceptual problems with Crafts' extension, and it is not tested nor is it testable. New estimates of regional GDP for the period 1861 to 1911 contradict Crafts's suggestion of rising regional inequality. Purchasing power parity adjustments do not alter this trend. The new estimates confirm Ireland's post-Famine catch-up. The great bulk of Irish labour productivity growth can be accounted for by an upward shifting production function, though it can be argued that that portion of growth that represents catch-up may be attributable to labour force decline.;2015;Regional GDP in the UK, 1861–1911: new estimates;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Gianfreda, Giuseppina; Mattesini, Fabrizio";We study the regime of multiple note issuers that characterized the Italian monetary system from the unification of Italy in 1861 to the creation of the Bank of Italy in 1893. We describe how the system evolved and we analyze how it functioned by studying the clearing of notes among banks. Since by law banknotes had to be redeemed at par, we focus on the ability of banks to keep notes in circulation before redemption. We estimate adverse clearings of notes issued by the dominant bank [Banca Nazionale degli Stati Sardi (BNS)] in the provinces where this bank had branches and we find that the entry of a smaller issuer limited the BNS’s capacity to keep its notes in circulation at the local level. We take this as evidence that competition in note issuance worked as an effective discipline device. Our results are consistent with the analysis of Pareto (Journal des économistes 3–28, 1893) who maintained that the fall of the Italian system was not due to the failure of the competitive mechanism, but rather to the altering of the rules of the game by the government.;2015;Adverse clearings in a monetary system with multiple note issuers: the case of Italy (1861–1893);Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Gill, David James;The UK received its first sovereign credit ratings in 1978. Despite having required financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund only 18 months earlier, the British government managed to secure ?triple-A? ratings from both Standard and Poor's and Moody's. Both assessments of creditworthiness reflected improving economic conditions but also British efforts to influence the sovereign ratings process. The Bank of England and the Treasury sought guidance from American investment banks to prepare for the ratings process and then controlled the flow of information available to the rating agencies accordingly, stressing the strengths of the national economy and downplaying the weaknesses. The British government subsequently launched its first bond issue in the New York market to high levels of investor demand. Consideration of these achievements complements the historiography concerning Britain's economic fortunes in the late 1970s. Scrutiny of events also offers a rare glimpse into the confidential sovereign ratings process. Both agencies relied on a combination of quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the UK. In addition, this article highlights the existence of a unique period in the history of sovereign credit ratings. From 1974 to 1985, the ratings industry enjoyed a cautious revival focused principally on ?triple-A? borrowers.;2015;Rating the UK: the British government's sovereign credit ratings, 1976–8;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Giordano, Claire; Giugliano, Ferdinando";This paper presents the first quantitative assessment of labour productivity dynamics in Italy's industrial sector between 1911 and 1951 and explores their links with changes in competition policy. It relies on a newly compiled dataset and provides fresh labour productivity estimates, disaggregated by industrial branch. Its main finding is that the switch to a more interventionist industrial policy enacted by the Fascist regime circa 1926–7 caused a marked slowdown in productivity growth. Nor was the government's decision to relocate resources from the traditional to the more modern industrial branches successful in lifting productivity dynamics: our shift-share analysis shows that the contribution of (static and dynamic) structural change from old to new industries to productivity growth was negligible. Finally, we find that the increase in the levels and growth rates of concentration, induced by specific Fascist policies, were associated with lower productivity levels and growth rates. This paper thus casts a shadow on the optimist accounts of Fascist industrial policy and confirms the findings of a revisionist literature minimising the positive role played by the State in the earlier stages of Italian industrialization.;2015;A tale of two Fascisms: Labour productivity growth and competition policy in Italy, 1911–1951;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Greenwood, Michael J.; Ward, Zachary";Little is known about international return migration because governments rarely track out-migrants. However, one exception occurred early in the 20th century when the United States kept records of emigrants. Using within-country changes in quota allocations in 1921, 1924, and 1929 in combination with 1908–1932 data on specific countries of intended destination of the emigrants, we estimate the effect of quotas on (1) out-migration rates, (2) emigration across skill groups, and (3) the duration of temporary migrants' stays in the U.S. Higher quota restrictions reduced emigration rates, mostly for unskilled laborers and farmers. Higher quota restrictions also increased duration of stay, as the share of migrants staying less than 5years fell and the share staying 5 to 10years rose. Return migration behavior was also associated with changes in previous immigrant cohort's networks and savings. Return migration rates were also low during World War I, and more significant population losses from the War in home countries discouraged return migration. Finally, out-migration of German migrants increased substantially during the 1920s.;2015;Immigration quotas, World War I, and emigrant flows from the United States in the early 20th century;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Grieco, Paul L. E.; Ziebarth, Nicolas L.";We present a new theory and quantitative evidence on the incidence of unigeniture. Existing theories hypothesize some sort of indivisibility or increasing returns to scale in wealth to overcome the testator’s inclination toward equal sharing among heirs. Examining a micro-level data set of seventeenth-century English wills, we find that even after controlling for land and other presumed sources of increasing returns to scale and indivisibility, other variables such as financial wealth still correlate with the incidence of unigeniture. This leads us to propose a model where unigeniture is an efficient way to provide insurance against income shocks. An important implication of the theory is that observed unequal bequests are partially counteracted by ex post transfers. Therefore, inequality of bequests cannot be taken as evidence of inequality of consumption between heirs.;2015;Unigeniture in an uncertain world;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Grossman, Richard S.;This article presents data on quantity, capital gains, dividend yields, and total returns of domestic and overseas equities listed on the London Stock Exchange during 1869?1929. Indices are presented for Africa, Asia, Australia (including New Zealand), Europe, Latin America, and North America (as well as for the UK), and for the finance, transportation, raw materials, and utilities sectors in each region. Returns and volatility were typically highest in emerging regions and the raw materials sector. Dividend yields were similar across regions and differences in total returns were due largely to disparities in capital gains. Contingent liability was most extensively employed where leverage was high and the physical assets were either meagre or inaccessible to creditors.;2015;Bloody foreigners!

"Guinnane, Timothy W.; STREB, JOCHEN";Germany introduced compulsory industrial accident insurance in 1884. The accident-insurance system compensated injured workers and survivors for losses, but initially failed to limit the growth of accident rates. We trace this failure to the 1884 law's faulty incentives and to an initial unwillingness to use the tools built into the law. The government regulator increasingly stressed rules that forced firms to adopt specific safety-enhancing innovations and practices. Econometric analysis shows that more consistent use of the rules and the limited incentives available under the law would have reduced industrial accidents earlier and more extensively.;2015;Incentives That (Could Have) Saved Lives: Government Regulation of Accident Insurance Associations in Germany, 1884–1914;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Harris, Richard; Keay, Ian; Lewis, Frank D.";Infant industry protection has been the cornerstone of a debate on tariff policy that extends at least from the eighteenth century to the current day. In contrast to traditional neo-classical models of international trade that imply net negative effects, industrial organization and learning-by-doing trade models describe how protective tariffs can encourage output expansion, productivity improvement, and price reductions. Taking Canada's 1879 National Policy as a natural experiment, we explore the effect of a policy that substantially increased tariff protection to some, but not all, Canadian manufacturing industries. Using treatment intensity and difference-in-differences approaches, we find strong support for the predictions of the new trade models. After 1879, industries that received greater protection experienced faster growth in output and productivity, as well as larger price reductions. The industries targeted by the National Policy also exhibited greater returns to scale and faster learning rates. These results have important implications for the infant-industry debate in addition to addressing a central theme in Canadian economic history,;2015;Protecting infant industries: Canadian manufacturing and the national policy, 1870–1913;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"HENRIKSEN, INGRID; McLaughlin, Eoin; Sharp, Paul Richard";Why did the establishment of cooperative creameries in late nineteenth-century Ireland fail to halt the relative decline of her dairy industry compared with other emerging producers? This paper compares the Irish experience with that of the market leader, Denmark, and shows how each adopted the cooperative organizational form, and highlights that an important difference was institutional: specifically, regarding the enforcement of vertically binding contracts. We argue that this failure, combined with a strong proprietary sector which was opposed to cooperation, reinforced the already difficult conditions for dairying in Ireland due to poor social capital.;2015;Contracts and cooperation: the relative failure of the Irish dairy industry in the late nineteenth century reconsidered;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Henriques, A.;"This article presents a benchmark for Portuguese agrarian output for the 1311–20 decade. This benchmark is built from the supply side using the value of church tithes combined with contemporary parish accounts. Two main findings emerge: first, per capita agrarian output was similar in the recently conquered South and the North, hinting that internal migration after the Reconquista led to the equalization of marginal product across the country; second, that Portuguese real per capita agrarian output was above subsistence and higher than that of contemporary England and Wales. This result, which is robust to the assumptions used, confirms that by 1320 Portugal was a “frontier economy” with a high land/labor ratio and a high per capita output. This seems to reinforce the Malthusian theory that the amount of land per person was key in determining living standards. The article discusses the implication of these results for the inequality among nations.";2015;Plenty of land, land of plenty: the agrarian output of Portugal (1311-20);European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Hill, Matthew J.;This paper reexamines the first viable and a still leading explanation for mid-twentieth century baby booms: Richard Easterlin's relative income hypothesis. He suggested that when incomes are higher than material aspirations (formed in childhood), birth rates would rise. This paper uses microeconomic data to formulate a measure of an individual's relative income. The use of microeconomic data allows the researcher to control for both state fixed effects and cohort fixed effects, both have been absent in previous examinations of Easterlin's hypothesis. The results of the empirical analysis are consistent with Easterlin's assertion that relative income influenced fertility decisions, although the effect operates only through childhood income. When the estimated effects are contextualized, they explain 12% of the U.S. baby boom.;2015;Easterlin revisited: Relative income and the baby boom;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Hill, Matthew J.;I examine the impact of the Great Depression on marriage outcomes and find that marriage rates and local economic conditions are positively correlated. Specifically, poor labor market opportunities for men negatively impact marriage. Conversely, there is some evidence that poor female labor markets actually increase marriage in the period. While the Great Depression did lower marriage rates, the effect was not long lasting: marriages were delayed, not denied. The primary long-run effect of the downturn on marriage was stability: Marriages formed in tough economic times were more likely to survive compared to matches made in more prosperous time periods.;2015;Love in the Time of the Depression: The Effect of Economic Conditions on Marriage in the Great Depression;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
HOFFMAN, PHILIP T.;Although politics has a huge effect on economic outcomes, we still know too little about what public goods states furnish or what determines the laws, regulations, and policies that states adopt. Worse yet, we do not really understand how states arise in the first place and how they gain the ability to tax. There are numerous unanswered questions here that economic historians can profitably work on, and their research will be particularly valuable if they model the politics, gather data on taxation and spending by local and central governments, and pay serious attention to the historical details and to political behavior that may not involve optimization.;2015;What Do States Do?

"HOFFMAN, PHILIP T.; Postel-Vinay, Gilles; Rosenthal, Jean-Laurent";Poorly developed financial markets are widely believed to block economic growth, because only modern financial intermediaries such as banks can mobilize large amounts of financial capital at low cost. This claim is supported by cross country regressions, but the regressions assume that credit intermediation is measured accurately before modern financial intermediaries arrive. If traditional intermediaries were mobilizing large amounts of financial capital before banks or other modern intermediaries appear, then the strength of the relationship between financial development and economic growth would be cast into doubt. Using an original panel dataset from nineteenth-century France, we provide the first estimates of how much financial capital key traditional intermediaries (notaries) were mobilizing for an entire economy during its first century of economic growth, and we analyze the lending that the notaries made possible in French mortgage market. The amount of capital they mobilized turns out to be large. We then analyze the effect that financial deepening had on the notaries as banks spread and find that the banks' and notaries' services were in all likelihood complements. The implication is that the link between financial development and economic growth may therefore be weaker than is assumed.;2015;Entry, information, and financial development: A century of competition between French banks and notaries;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Horrell, Sara; Humphries, Jane; Sneath, Ken";"While consumption has moved to centre stage in accounts of Britain's industrialization, evidence on the mass transformation of homes and expenditure on novelty is hard to reconcile with the poor living standards experienced by many working people. Part of the conundrum arises from the limitations of available probate evidence, but the motivational drivers behind raised consumption can also be questioned. Was it changed tastes or falling prices because of improved technology which prompted the purchase of new goods? Utilizing evidence from an alternative source, property stolen through housebreaking and burglary as reported in the Old Bailey Papers and Proceedings for 1750?1821, we identify those goods that were commonly stolen as the fashion icons of their day, trace such goods back to their original owners, thus linking ownership and status, and through analysis over time show how consumption evolved. This analysis incorporates the influence of price and real incomes on ownership, allowing the influence of price and fashion on consumption patterns to be identified separately. The findings show that, in addition to price and income effects, fashion had a strong influence, but this was not just emulation; differentiation too was evident. The evidence points to a complex interplay between desires and differentiation, aspiration and affordability, in determining the goods that people possessed.";2015;Consumption conundrums unravelled;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Huff, Gregg; Huff, Gillian";This article analyses demographic change in Southeast Asia's main cities during and soon after the Second World War Japanese occupation. We argue that two main patterns of population movements are evident. In food-deficit areas, a search for food security typically led to large net inflows to main urban centres. By contrast, an urban exodus dominated in food surplus regions because the chief risk was to personal safety, especially from Japanese and Allied bombing. Black markets were ubiquitous, and essential to sustaining livelihoods in cities with food-deficit hinterlands. In Rangoon and Manila, wartime population fluctuations were enormous. Famines in Java and northern Indochina severely impacted Jakarta and Hanoi through inflows of people from rural areas. In most countries, the war's aftermath of refugees, revolution, and political disruption generated major rural?urban population relocations. Turmoil in the 1940s had the permanent consequences of augmenting the primacy of Southeast Asia's main cities and promoting squatter settlement.;2015;Urban growth and change in 1940s Southeast Asia;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Although we find a surprisingly weak connection linking ocean freight rates to British exports, after controlling for endogeneity and measuring all costs associated with inter-continental pig iron shipments and the intra-continental assembly of raw materials, the importance of transportation strongly asserts itself. The cost to transport pig iron across the Atlantic, and the cost to transport iron ore and coking coal within North America, were important determinants of the volume of British exports.;2015;Transport Costs and Trade Volumes: Evidence from the Trans-Atlantic Iron Trade, 1870–1913;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Justman, Moshe; van der BEEK, KARINE";This article draws on quantitative and descriptive data from Robert Campbell's manual for prospective apprentices, The London tradesman (1747), to demonstrate the responsiveness of apprenticeship premiums in mid-eighteenth-century London to market forces of supply and demand. It first shows that Campbell's data on mid-eighteenth-century journeymen wages, apprenticeship premiums, and masters? set-up costs in London are consistent with other sources. It then applies instrumental variable regressions to estimate the elasticity of apprenticeship premiums with respect to journeymen wages and set-up costs, using Campbell's education and ability requirements by trade to instrument for wages. We find an elasticity of one with respect to wages, and of 0.25 with respect to set-up costs, both statistically significant at a p-value less than 0.1%. We interpret these findings as supporting the thesis that apprenticeship played an important role in adapting the English workforce to the skill requirements of the industrial revolution in its early stages, insofar as the institution of apprenticeship in London was representative of other parts of England. Furthermore, by demonstrating the internal and external consistency of Campbell's observations, our findings should encourage their use as an unparalleled source of detailed, trade-specific wage data from the early years of the industrial revolution.;2015;Market forces shaping human capital in eighteenth-century London;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Keay, Ian;This paper documents the channels through which commodity price volatility can affect resource intensive industries’ investment decisions, production levels and profitability. Over the very long run, the Canadian forestry sector was not immune from the negative effects of commodity price volatility. However, the long run averages mask dynamic and asymmetric patterns in the sector’s responses to price volatility. The supply of investment funds from formal-external sources was suppressed during episodes of high and rising commodity price volatility, but insensitive to low and falling volatility. These effects weakened as the economy matured. The accumulation of reproducible and natural capital was affected by commodity price volatility through an investment supply channel that was also asymmetric, but in this case, the effect was strongest during low and falling volatility. These results show how a maturing economy with diversified investment opportunities can become increasingly immune from the negative effects of commodity price volatility.;2015;Immunity from the resource curse?

The REA provided loans to cooperatives to lay distribution lines to farms and aid in wiring homes. Consequently, the number of rural farm homes electrified doubled in the United States within five years. We develop a panel data set for the 1930s and use changes within counties over time to identify the effect of the REA loans on a wide range of socio-economic measures. The REA loans contributed significantly to increases in crop output and crop productivity and helped stave off declines in overall farm output, productivity, and land values, but they had much smaller effects on nonagricultural parts of the economy. The ex-ante subsidy from the low-interest loans was large, but after the program was completed, nearly all of the loans were fully repaid, and the ultimate cost to the taxpayer was relatively low.;2015;Flip the Switch: The Impact of the Rural Electrification Administration 1935–1940;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Lampe, Markus; Sharp, Paul Richard";The success of Danish agricultural exports at the end of the nineteenth century is often attributed to the establishment of a direct trade with Britain after the loss of Schleswig-Holstein to Prussia in 1864, and with it the connection to the port of Hamburg. We show that Danish–English butter markets were actually integrated already in the eighteenth century, but through the Hamburg hub, which provided advantages such as density of information, trade connections, and credit availability. These eroded gradually, and movements to establish a direct trade were underway from the 1850s.

Latham, Mark;Corruption by office holders in eighteenth-century British institutions, from state to local level, played an instrumental role in the emergence of modern bureaucracy, and the development of accountable, professionalized systems of administration. Due to the similarities between the institutional culture of eighteenth-century Britain and those within many contemporary developing societies, social scientists have also sought to draw lessons from Britain's historical experience of corruption. Yet little is known about the extent, impact, and causes of corruption by eighteenth-century office holders. This article presents the first detailed research into the topic. It utilises the rich administrative and financial records associated with the institution charged with funding and undertaking the maintenance of London Bridge?the Bridge House?to conduct a systematic qualitative and quantitative study of corruption by office holders. The article identifies an ingrained culture of corruption amongst Bridge House officers, and provides quantitative evidence of the substantial impact corruption had on the organization's finances. However, contrary to existing studies on corruption, this article concludes that, although extensive and significant, corruption did not perform a functional role in the context of this institution. The article also provides a methodology and comparator for future studies into this topic.;2015;‘The city has been wronged and abused!’: institutional corruption in the eighteenth century;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Li, Ling-Fan;This article examines the impact of information asymmetry on the movement of London?Antwerp exchange rates against the backdrop of the Great Debasement of 1544?51. The case of the revaluation of gold coins in the Habsburg Netherlands in 1539, about which the sovereign and the public possessed similar information, is used as the benchmark to judge how far the speed of adjustment was affected by information asymmetry. This article is also part of the recent literature that estimates the degree of financial market integration in late medieval and early modern Europe. In the framework of the threshold autoregressive model, the speed of adjustment and the transaction costs associated with arbitrage are estimated, and the results are judged using the speed of communication as a benchmark since the flow of information played a critical role in financial arbitrage. The results reveal that the sixteenth-century London?Antwerp exchange markets were already as integrated as that during the late nineteenth century, but information asymmetry severely disturbed the effectiveness of exchange arbitrage.;2015;Information asymmetry and the speed of adjustment: debasements in the mid-sixteenth century;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Lindberg, Erik;This paper uses the history of lighthouses in Sweden to discuss the relative roles of public and private productions of public goods in a developing economy. In Sweden, like in England, there were private lighthouses financed by light dues levied on ships calling at particular harbors. However, private provision generally played a marginal role in the expansion of sea safety arrangements. The provision of large-scale public goods in a developing economy such as Sweden relied on public, not private, provision.

Liu, William Guanglin;"In light of the Schumpeterian paradigm, this article explores the rise of the tax state in eleventh-century China and its further transition towards a fiscal state until the Mongol conquest in 1279. By the late eleventh century in the Song dynasty, two-thirds of state revenues came from taxing non-agricultural sectors, especially from the collection of excise. The Song state became the first sustainable tax state in global history, as manifested in three major aspects: monetization; indirect taxation; and centralization and professionalization in the tax administration. The boundary of the Song tax state was largely confined to urban settlements. In rural areas, the state gave up the collection of commercial taxes by farming out this right to local elites. In the twelfth century, as traditional tax revenues fell far short of supporting military defence, the Song administration utilized credit instruments. Around 1200, the amount of redeemable promissory notes first exceeded that of annual tax revenues. This shift from tax-based public finance to credit-based public finance completed the transition towards a fiscal state. Nonetheless, this development in the fiscal state was still at an early stage and proved to be unstable. Toward the end of the Southern Song, hyperinflation caused by the over-issuance of promissory notes seriously threatened the economy.";2015;The making of a fiscal state in Song China, 960–1279;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

This paper examines the earnings gap between urban and rural workers in Sweden between 1865 and 1985. Proper measurement by cost-of-living, working hours and unemployment causes most of the nominal gap to disappear. What remains is a long-run equilibrium that was interrupted by major external shocks in the interwar years when the urban wage premium soared. The increase in the wage gap stemmed from asymmetric labor market responses to the external shocks, explained by the dissimilar institutional configurations of the two labor markets.;2015;Markets and politics: the Swedish urban–rural wage gap, 1865–1985;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Martínez-Galarraga, Julio; Tirado-Fabregat, Daniel A.; González-Val, Rafael";In this study, parametric and nonparametric techniques are employed to analyze the effect of changes in regional market potential on the growth of Spanish regions during the period 1860–1930. The study of Spain sheds light on whether the construction of new transport infrastructures coupled with changes in trade policy ultimately shaped regional growth trajectories. The study draws upon new evidence of per capita gross domestic product for Spanish provinces and combines this evidence with Harris' market-potential function to measure regional market potential. Results show that market potential had a positive influence on regional economic growth, particularly between 1900 and 1930.;2015;Market potential and regional economic growth in Spain (1860–1930);European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Martín-Retortillo, Miguel; Pinilla, Vicente";The objective of this study is to make a further contribution to the debate on the causes of economic growth in the European Continent. It explains why agricultural labour productivity differences did not converge between 1950 and 2005 in Europe. We propose an econometric model, one combining both proximate and fundamental causes of economic growth. The results show that the continuous exit of labour power from the sector, coupled with the increased use of productive factors originating in other sectors of the economy, caused the efficiency of agricultural workers to rise. However, we offer a complete explanation of the role played by institutions and geographical factors. Thus, we detect a direct and inverse relation between membership of the EU and the Communist bloc and the productivity of agricultural labour. In addition, strong support for agriculture affected productivity negatively.;2015;On the causes of economic growth in Europe: why did agricultural labour productivity not converge between 1950 and 2005?;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
McDonald, John;In the eleventh-century England, the principal economic activity was agricultural production on manorial estates. The paper exploits the Domesday Survey data, collected in 1086, to investigate the entrepreneurial ability of managers of the main classes of estate, king’s, ecclesiastical and lay estates. Wiltshire data are used to assess whether similar production functions describe production on the three classes of estate. Then, data envelopment analysis (DEA) methods are used to assess whether, after controlling for factors that could have affected efficiency, one class of estate was worked more efficiently. Finally, the Wiltshire results are compared with those from an earlier study of Essex. The Wiltshire analysis confirms the conclusions of the Essex study. In both counties, despite differences in institutional structures, there was little difference between production processes and management performance on the three classes of estate.;2015;Entrepreneurship in Wiltshire, England, almost 1,000 years ago;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

We show that it took more than a century for all states to create separate agencies tasked with monitoring the safety and soundness of banks.

"Mitchener, Kris James; Weidenmier, Marc D.";We use a standard metric from international finance, the currency risk premium, to assess the credibility of fixed exchange rates during the classical gold standard era. Theory suggests that a completely credible and permanent commitment to join the gold standard would have zero currency risk or no expectation of devaluation. We find that, even five years after a typical emerging-market country joined the gold standard, the currency risk premium averaged at least 220 basis points. Fixed-effects, panel-regression estimates that control for a variety of borrower-specific factors also show large and positive currency risk premia. In contrast to core gold standard countries, such as France and Germany, the persistence of large premia, long after gold standard adoption, suggest that financial markets did not view the pegs in emerging markets as credible and expected that they devaluation.;2015;Was the Classical Gold Standard Credible on the Periphery?

Next, we describe the particular banking system of Spain, characterized by the coexistence of the Bank of Spain with multiple local banks of issue and a number of joint-stock banks (sociedades de crédito). We analyze the microeconomic behavior of each bank and find that, overall, the banks of issue performed well during the crisis.

These dynamics were largely driven by trade, involving initially England, France, and Germany but increasingly centered on Germany.

"Murray, John E.; Silvestre, Javier";This article considers new technologies and fatal accident rates in European coal mining from 1850 to 1900. Its contributions are twofold: to recover and emphasize improvements in small-scale mine technologies such as safety lamps and ventilation, and, second, to deny any role at this time for later macroinventions such as electrification and mechanization. We discuss the influence of these safety-improving technologies as well as government regulations on different kinds of fatal accident rates. It is proposed that an important and overlooked source of the reduction in fatalities from certain kinds of accidents was the introduction and diffusion of a variety of safety-related technologies, none of particularly large scale.;2015;Small-scale technologies and European coal mine safety, 1850–1900;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Nicholas, Tom;Recent research indicates the joint stock form was not a superior type of business organization in many countries historically. In Japan, however, its role was more pervasive. From 1896 to 1939 joint stock enterprises accounted for 44 percent of registered businesses and 80 percent of total capital. From 1922 to 1939 these enterprises outperformed other forms and generated 94 percent of aggregate profits. External finance factors, Japan's development phase, industrial structure, public policy, and culture led to high joint stock usage. The private limited liability company, introduced in 1938, did not displace the joint stock form.;2015;The Organization of Enterprise in Japan;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Nuvolari, Alessandro; Vasta, Michelangelo";This article examines the phenomenon of independent invention in Italy during the Liberal Age (1861?1913). It makes use of a new dataset comprising all patents granted in Italy in five benchmark years: 1864?5, 1881, 1891, 1902, and 1911. The following exercises are carried out. First, an examination is undertaken of the shares of independent, corporate, and foreign inventions and their evolution over time and across industries. Second, by exploiting the peculiarities of Italian patent legislation, which was characterized by relatively cheap fees and a flexible renewal scheme, the relative quality of independent and corporate patents is assessed. The results indicate that in Italy independent inventors made an important contribution to technological change in terms of number of patents, but the quality of their patents was significantly lower than that of firms and of foreign patentees.;2015;Independent invention in Italy during the Liberal Age, 1861–1913;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Ogasawara, Kota; Kobayashi, Genya";Although no comprehensive sickness insurance system existed in Japan until the mid-twentieth century, the infant mortality rate in Japan started to decline from the early twentieth century onwards, specifically owing to health improvements in low-income areas. This paper focuses on the impact of social workers called Homen iin on reducing the infant mortality rate in inter-war Tokyo. These social workers were in charge of the medical casework and provided access to medical treatment for low-income households under the District Committees System. To examine how the activities of these social workers influenced infant mortality, this paper analyses panel data for Tokyo between 1926 and 1937. By employing the dynamic panel quantile regression approach, it is found that the activities of social workers played a vital role in mitigating the risk of infant mortality, especially in areas that had a higher infant mortality rate.;2015;The impact of social workers on infant mortality in inter-war Tokyo: Bayesian dynamic panel quantile regression with endogenous variables;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
O'Sullivan, Mary A.;The enthusiasm of British portfolio investors for US industry in the late 1880s has been seen as evidence of the liberalism of the London Stock Exchange and the conservatism of the New York Stock Exchange. Based on a study of Anglo-American brewing issues on the London market between 1888 and 1892, in this article it is argued that such an interpretation cannot be sustained. For these issues, securing access to the London market proved more demanding than accounts of its liberalism would lead us to expect: in fact, Anglo-American brewing companies submitted to strictures from London that were more constraining than those of the New York market. Promoters accepted London's constraints to take advantage of the high valuations assigned to Anglo-American brewing securities there, which reflected the city's success in building demand based on financial machinery that did not exist in New York. That machinery included underwriting syndicates, accounting standards, and the London Stock Exchange's listing rules, although, from this perspective, it was the rigour of the exchange's rules that was important. Still, vetting securities for quotation was not the same as for investment, as the disappointing performance of the Anglo-American brewing securities soon revealed.;2015;Yankee Doodle went to London: Anglo-American breweries and the London securities market, 1888–92;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Panza, Laura; Williamson, Jeffrey G.";Muhammad Ali, who ruled Egypt between 1805 and 1849, intervened in Egyptian markets in an attempt to foster industrialization, especially between 1812 and 1840. Like a modern marketing board, the state purchased agricultural commodities (cotton and wheat) at low prices and sold them on world markets at much higher prices, a policy equivalent to an export tax. Ali also replaced tax farming with his own land taxes. The revenues so derived were used in part to finance manufacturing investment and to build irrigation canals. In addition, Ali supplied flax and cotton at those cheap purchase prices to domestic textile manufacturing, thus subsidizing the industry. He also used non-tariff barriers to exclude foreign competition from domestic markets. Were Ali's state-led policies successful in fostering industry? The answer is no easier to extract from this phase of Egyptian history than from that of other poor countries at that time. This is because Egypt faced the same terms of trade boom typical of most poor commodity exporters, which was causing de-industrialization everywhere else in the poor periphery. Ali picked a very difficult time to pursue his agenda, but we show that his policies were successful.;2015;Did Muhammad Ali foster industrialization in early nineteenth-century Egypt?;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Parman, John M.;Negative shocks to childhood health can have a lasting impact on the economic success of an individual by altering families' schooling investment decisions. This article introduces a new dataset of brothers serving in World War II and uses it to demonstrate that improvements in childhood health led to substantial increases in educational attainment in the first one-half of the twentieth century. By exploiting variation in health within families, the data show that this relationship between childhood health and educational attainment holds even after controlling for both observed and unobserved household and environmental characteristics.;2015;Childhood Health and Human Capital: New Evidence from Genetic Brothers in Arms;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Parman, John M.;This paper uses the 1918 influenza pandemic to test how household resources are reallocated in response to a health shock to one child. Using a new dataset linking census data on childhood household characteristics to adult outcomes from military enlistment records, I show that families with a child in utero during the pandemic shifted resources to the child's older siblings, leading to significantly higher educational attainments for these older siblings. These results suggest that the reallocation of household resources in response to a negative childhood health shock tended to reinforce rather than compensate for differences in endowments across children.;2015;Childhood health and sibling outcomes: Nurture Reinforcing nature during the 1918 influenza pandemic;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

This territory saw an early development of a large, but spatially dispersed industrial sector and an agrarian reform in 1832. We establish, first, that food demand from the labor force of the non-agricultural sectors promoted agricultural development in the absence of urbanization as well; nevertheless, the spatial dispersion of demand limited the pace of growth. Second, agrarian reform had no effect on output and productivity growth. This is because, on the one hand, the reform consisted mainly in a redistribution of income from land in the long run and did not affect incentive structures. On the other hand, property rights during the pre-reform period were both sufficiently secure and negotiable to reallocate land to more intensive patterns of arable farming under a traditional property rights regime.";2015;Institutions versus demand: determinants of agricultural development in Saxony, 1660–1850;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Pittaluga, Giovanni B.; Cama, Giampiero; Seghezza, Elena";The recent literature on democratization has traced this process back to the extension of suffrage. However, democratization concerns different aspects, not only the extension of suffrage, but also the extent of the powers of parliament. These two different dimensions of democracy are interdependent and can even be opposed. We show that the political elite may grant universal suffrage to counter pressure exerted by the bourgeoisie in favor of a widening of the powers of the parliament. By extending suffrage to the masses, the political elite makes it less advantageous for the bourgeoisie to seek a more powerful parliament. However, the entry, even in a parliament without powers, of representatives of the working class leads the political elite to ensure some form of redistribution. The historical experiences of some Western European countries during the nineteenth century and in the early twentieth century confirm this thesis.;2015;Democracy, extension of suffrage, and redistribution in nineteenth-century Europe;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Puttevils, Jeroen;"This article studies the distribution of exports from mid-sixteenth-century Antwerp at the individual and group level (grouped by merchant origin). Recently, scholars have argued that sixteenth-century Antwerp, and in its wake a series of other cities, hosted an open-access market as a result of an evolution towards open-access institutions. However, the direct effect of this institutional change on merchant enterprise is hard to measure. Relying on detailed tax records, preferences at the individual merchant level for particular destinations and commodities are documented, to evaluate whether exporters had equal chances in Antwerp's export market. A few exporters had large export shares next to a multitude of smaller merchants. The exports of these smaller merchants to distant destinations and their participation in the export of important products demonstrate a fairly level commercial playing field with regard to their larger-scale colleagues. Foreign traders had access to trade in Low Countries products, while local merchants were active in the export of major transit products. The activities of the latter group are particularly important; contrary to previous literature, Low Countries traders did not differ in their preference for home-grown products.";2015;‘Eating the bread out of their mouth’: Antwerp's export trade and generalized institutions, 1544–5;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Radburn, Nicholas;This article uses a new dataset of 330 slaving voyages to examine terms of credit issued for British American slave sales between 1755 and 1807. It shows that credit terms consistently varied between American colonies, and that slave ship captains considered these differences when electing where to land enslaved Africans. Our dataset also shows that credit terms were highly erratic, especially in the last quarter of the century, contributing to both surges and collapses in the slave trade to individual colonies, and in the trade as a whole. Four such instances are examined in detail to show that instability in credit terms played an important and hitherto unacknowledged role in the volume and direction of Britain's trans-Atlantic slave trade in the second one-half of the eighteenth century.;2015;Keeping “the wheel in motion”: Trans-Atlantic Credit Terms, Slave Prices, and the Geography of Slavery in the British Americas, 1755–1807;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Saavedra, Martin;In 1942, the United States incarcerated all Japanese Americans on the West Coast, including children, in internment camps. Using non-West Coast Japanese Americans and non-Japanese Asians as control groups, I estimate the effect of attending a War Relocation Authority school on educational attainment. Non-linear difference-in-differences estimates suggest that attending school within the internment camps decreased the probability of receiving a post-collegiate education by approximately 4 to 5 percentage points and decreased the probability of receiving a college degree by between 2 and 7 percentage points. I find some evidence that attending a WRA school may have decreased the returns to education as well.

"Sabaté, Marcela; Escario, Regina; Gadea, María Dolores";The recent financial crisis has placed the concept of fiscal dominance at the center of current debates on macro-prudential policies. However, empirical evidence of fiscal dominance, understood as fiscal policy driving monetary policy, has been mixed, especially for low inflation countries. The literature hypothesizes that institutional constraints are the reason for the failure to connect deficits to money and prices in these countries. This paper, focusing on Spain 1874–1998, illustrates their constraining role in two steps. First, a recursive estimation of the link from budget to money shows how the degree of fiscal dominance varied over time. Second, we are able to establish a connection between these changes in the intensity of fiscal dominance and changes in the intensity of the institutional (exchange rate and central bank independence) constraints.;2015;Fighting fiscal dominance.

Saito, Osamu;This article addresses the question of growth and inequality in the great and little divergence trajectories on both sides of Eurasia. A social table constructed for Tokugawa Japan in the 1840s is compared with two cases with high levels of inequality, Stuart England and Mughal India, and the subsequent changes in the three countries are traced to the modern era of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The Japanese pattern in the early modern period can be characterized by comparatively modest growth with a relatively egalitarian distribution of income between the social classes, but the pattern changed during the subsequent half-century to one with an increased tempo of growth and a substantial rise in the level of income inequality. The implications of this finding are discussed in terms of the concept of Smithian growth and are placed in the comparative context of the divergence debate.;2015;Growth and inequality in the great and little divergence debate: a Japanese perspective;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Saleh, Mohamed;In 1805–1882, Egypt embarked on one of the earliest state industrialization programs.

I find that there were inter-religious differentials in reaping the benefits (or losses) of industrialization. The first state industrialization wave was “de-skilling” among Muslims but “up-skilling” among Christians, while the second wave was “up-skilling” for both groups.

"Sanchis, Teresa; Sanchis-Llopis, Juan A.; Esteve, Vicente; Cubel, Antonio";This paper analyses the relationship between total factor productivity (TFP) and innovation-related variables during the second half of the twentieth century. We perform this analysis for several European countries (France, Germany, UK, and Spain) and the USA, extending Coe and Helpman’s (Eur Econ Rev 39:859–887, 1995) empirical specification to include human capital. We use a new dataset of patents data for the past 150 years to calculate the stock of knowledge using the perpetual inventory method. Our time series empirical analysis confirms the heterogeneous relationship between innovation variables (domestic stock of knowledge, imports of knowledge, and human capital) and productivity. Our results reveal the extent to which observed differences in technology adoption patterns and the levels of endowment of such resources can explain differences in TFP dynamics across countries. The estimated coefficients confirm the considerable gap that still exists between the European countries and the USA in innovation-related variables. Furthermore, we obtain a finding that may have important implications for innovation policies: the higher the levels of human capital and domestic knowledge stocks, the higher will be the response of TFP to a 1 % increase in any of the aforementioned variables;2015;Total factor productivity, domestic knowledge accumulation, and international knowledge spillovers in the second half of the twentieth century;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Scott, Peter M.; WALKER, JAMES T.; MISKELL, PETER";The early twentieth century constituted the heyday of the ?breadwinner?homemaker? household, characterized by a high degree of intra-household functional specialization between paid and domestic work according to age, gender, and marital status. This article examines the links between formal workforce participation and access to resources for individualized discretionary spending in British working-class households during the late 1930s, via an analysis of household leisure expenditures. Leisure spending is particularly salient to intra-household resource allocation, as it constitutes one of the most highly prioritized areas of individualized expenditure, especially for young, single people. Using a database compiled from surviving returns to the Ministry of Labour's national 1937/8 working-class expenditure survey, we examine leisure participation rates for over 600 households, using a detailed set of commercial leisure activities together with other relevant variables. We find that the employment status of family members other than the male breadwinner was a key factor influencing their access to commercial leisure. Our analysis thus supports the view that the breadwinner?homemaker household was characterized by strong power imbalances that concentrated resources?especially for individualized expenditures?in the hands of those family members who engaged in paid labour.;2015;British working-class household composition, labour supply, and commercial leisure participation during the 1930s;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Searle, Rebecca;This article explores the history of the cost of living index, tracing its evolution from its introduction in 1914 as a device designed to furnish an adequate evidential base for the tariff reform debate, through to the mid-twentieth century, when it had become one of the most important measures in the British economy, influencing the wages of millions of workers. By embedding the index within the wider economic, political, and social histories of the period, the article presents a consideration of how it came to exert such influence over the economy, and why, despite its widely acknowledged inadequacies, the index remained tied to a rough estimation of a pre-1914 pattern of working-class expenditure until 1947. Through examining the debates surrounding its compilation and the context in which decisions were taken about its modification, it is demonstrated that, far from being a neutral statistical measure, the official cost of living index was essentially political in nature.;2015;Is there anything real about real wages?

Semrad, Alexandra;Do new school types focusing on practical and business-related knowledge lead to increased economic performance? To analyse this question, this article examines the introduction of two types of modern secondary education, the Gewerbeschule and its successor, the Realschule, in nineteenth-century Bavaria. Since the opening of these schools is arguably endogenous?as it was mainly the large, prosperous cities that opened one?the estimated treatment effect capturing the economic influence of the Gewerbeschule/Realschule will lead to biased results. To alleviate this bias, propensity score matching is adopted to compare relatively similar counties with and without these schools. Using historical county-level data on tax revenues, business formations, employment structure, and patent holdings, ordinary least squares regression analysis shows that the opening of a modern secondary school is in general positively associated with economic performance several years later.;2015;Modern secondary education and economic performance: the introduction of the Gewerbeschule and Realschule in nineteenth-century Bavaria†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Silvestre, Javier; Ayuda, María Isabel; Pinilla, Vicente";Very few empirical studies have analysed the labour market performance of migrants in European countries in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. This article uses a rich new micro-dataset to examine the occupational attainment of migrants, mostly internal migrants, in the city of Barcelona, a key destination from the late nineteenth century onwards, adding to the literature on internal migrations in Spain during the period of industrialization. The study shows that the occupational outcomes achieved by early migrants tended to match those of natives, the reference group. However, some groups of migrants who arrived at the end of the period covered by the study show poorer outcomes than natives. The relative underachievement of these groups is explained by changes in the type of migrants and in the characteristics of the labour market. Our estimates also suggest that Spanish migrants did not experience upward occupational mobility after settling in Barcelona.;2015;The occupational attainment of migrants and natives in Barcelona, 1930;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Singleton, John; Schenk, Catherine R.";The management of foreign exchange reserves has recently attracted attention from both policy-makers and historians. Historical research has focussed on the nineteenth century and the interwar period, with less attention to the strategies of smaller countries in the final transition from sterling to the dollar in the post-1945 period. This article examines the evolution of reserve currency policy from the perspective of Australia and New Zealand in the 1960s and early 1970s. As in the 1930s, economic uncertainty and a shift in global economic power prompted changes in reserves strategy. Patterns of trade and debt and falling confidence in British economic policy prompted a move away from sterling, but the timing and extent of this transition were affected by the fragility of the sterling exchange rate, lack of alternative assets, and continued dependence on the London capital market. The choices for Australia and New Zealand were thus constrained, but they were able to leverage their position as holders of sterling to engage in agreements that provided an exchange rate guarantee for their sterling holdings and continued access to the London capital market. This mitigated the effect of the final global transition from sterling to the dollar while protecting their interests.;2015;The shift from sterling to the dollar, 1965–76: evidence from Australia and New Zealand;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Solar, Peter M.; Rönnbäck, Klas";British slave traders were early and rapid adopters of the new technique of sheathing ships' hulls with copper. From the 1780s this innovation increased sailing speeds of British slave ships by about a sixth, prolonged the ships' lives by at least a half, and reduced the death rates of slaves on the middle passage by about half. It was, above all, the fall in death rates, and possibly the improved condition of surviving slaves, that made the investment so compelling. Copper sheathing may have paid for itself in a single voyage, even though it was usually good for several. By the 1790s few slave ships, even if making only a single voyage, were uncoppered. These results confirm that copper sheathing was one of the major improvements in shipping productivity before the use of iron and steam in the mid-nineteenth century.;2015;Copper sheathing and the British slave trade;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Spoerer, Mark;The European Economic Community's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has found a lot of scholarly attention. While economists stress the irrationality of the CAP and explain its striking persistence by rent-seeking behavior, a prominent interpretation among historians is that the CAP should be interpreted as welfare policy for farm households. I subject the latter hypothesis for the period 1962–92 to an empirical test and find that the combined benefits from subsidies, import protection, and political prices gave much more benefits to European agriculture than any welfare policy could have achieved. If one still wants to find arguments legitimizing the political rents (or part of them) that agriculture received through the CAP one has to consider non-economic arguments (food security in the Cold War) or external effects (protection of the environment or landscape).;2015;Agricultural protection and support in the European Economic Community, 1962-92: rent-seeking or welfare policy?;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Torregrosa Hetland, Sara;The relationship between democracy, inequality, and redistribution has inspired extensive research, but consensus is still elusive. In order to contribute to this discussion, the author analyzes the Spanish case, where transition to democracy was accompanied by a comprehensive tax reform, aiming at increasing progressivity and revenue. But how effectively did it change the distribution of the tax burden? Was there a “fiscal revolution”? The results show that persistent regressivity (albeit decreasing) exacerbated income inequality, failing to attain convergence with more developed countries. The joint effect of the fiscal system, however, was slightly positive due to progressive social spending.;2015;Did democracy bring redistribution?

van Cruyningen, Piet;In the early modern period the viability of large-scale drainage projects implemented by courtiers, officials, or merchants could be endangered by litigation or violent conflicts with landlords, commoners, cities, or water boards whose interests were harmed by the implementation of such projects. A comparison between the Dutch Republic, England, and France shows that the Dutch had developed institutions to deal with this efficiently. State patents for drainage granted compensation to all parties involved and precluded long drawn-out lawsuits. When large-scale drainage began in England and France from c. 1600 onwards, these states had no experience with drainage regulation. They had to find their way by trial and error. In England this led to lawsuits and riots by commoners that ruined several drainage schemes. The decentralized nature of the Dutch state turned out to be an advantage. Dutch politicians and entrepreneurs were used to compromises, and solutions could be adapted to local circumstances. In more centralized England and France this was more difficult to achieve. The Dutch also profited from the fact that territorial lords had already abolished common rights of usage in the coastal provinces in the late middle ages, thus removing an important source of conflict.;2015;Dealing with drainage: state regulation of drainage projects in the Dutch Republic, France, and England during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Various proxy-based output series are available that imply either a 25% German labor-productivity lead over Britain or a parity of performance in 1907. The conventional strategy to deal with this conundrum involves a choice between the series. With the correlation between the different proxies and output unknown, such a choice is inappropriate because it results in the loss of information provided by the rejected proxies. Instead, this study makes full and efficient use of all information by estimating a common component in the various output series. The new estimate of output change implies a German lead over Britain in manufacturing labor productivity of 4.4% in 1907.;2015;Output growth in German manufacturing, 1907–1936.

WANDSCHNEIDER, KIRSTEN;Landschaften were cooperative mortgage associations that emerged in Prussia after the Seven Years War (1756–1763) to support the Prussian landed nobility. Landschaften issued covered mortgage bonds, called Pfandbriefe, which helped re-capitalize the Prussian estates. Relying on mortgage data for 554 estates, this article provides a detailed look at one of these institutions—the Landschaft of East Prussia. The article offers insights into the self-selection of participants and the distribution of credit. It also gives a quantitative assessment of the economic effects of the Landschaften with respect to ownership patterns and estate size.;2015;Landschaften as Credit Purveyors—The Example of East Prussia;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Weller, Leonardo;This article assesses how the government of Porfirio Díaz (1876–1910) negotiated sovereign loans. Mexico was a serial defaulter that established a good reputation and issued bonds abroad at progressively better conditions. Based on new archival material, the article demonstrates that borrowing terms improved not only because of sounder fundamentals, but also due to the efforts of high officials to negotiate with debt underwriters. The Mexicans never accepted a patron bank and used the offers from American banks to bargain with European competitors. They acted according to the government's reputation, the underwriters' status, and the ideology of the Porfirian state.;2015;Government versus Bankers: Sovereign Debt Negotiations in Porfirian Mexico, 1888–1910;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Zwart, Pim de; van Zanden, Jan Luiten";The development of living standards in Java has long been a subject of scholarly interest. A number of scholars have suggested that between 1600 and 1900 Southeast Asian living standards declined significantly. The present article contributes to these issues by calculating long-term real wages for Java between 1680 and 1914, following Allen's subsistence basket methodology. New data on wages and prices were collected from the Dutch East India Company (VOC) archives and connected to data on the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The resultant long-term real wage developments show a slightly different picture of Javanese living standards than that which has emerged from the literature to date.;2015;Labor, wages, and living standards in Java, 1680–1914;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Abildgren, Kim;The article explores the determinants of banks’ capital ratio in the Pre-Regulation Era where capital structure decisions were not influenced by deposit-insurance schemes, capital requirements, or high tax shields. The analysis builds on partial-adjustment capital-structure models estimated on the basis of panel data for all Danish commercial banks 1847–1919. The results suggest that banks with low levels of liquidity had a higher capital ratio in periods with financial instability. This enabled them to suffer larger losses and thereby reduce the risk of facing costs of financial distress.

"ACCOMINOTTI, OLIVIER; CHAMBERS, DAVID";This article explores the risks and returns to currency speculation during the 1920s and 1930s. We study the performance of two well-known technical trading strategies (carry and momentum) and compare them with that of a fundamentals-based trader: John Maynard Keynes. Technical strategies were highly profitable during the 1920s and even outperformed Keynes. In the 1930s, however, both technical strategies and Keynes performed relatively poorly. While our results reveal the existence of profitable opportunities for currency traders in the interwar years, they suggest that such profits were necessary compensation for enduring the substantial risks that all strategies entailed.;2016;If You're So Smart: John Maynard Keynes and Currency Speculation in the Interwar Years;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"ACHESON, GRAEME G.; CAMPBELL, GARETH; Turner, John D.; Vanteeva, Nadia";Scholars have long debated whether ownership matters for firm performance. The standard view regarding Victorian Britain is that family-controlled companies had a detrimental effect on performance. In this article, we examine this view using a hand-collected corporate ownership dataset. Our main finding is that it was not necessarily the broad structure of corporate ownership that mattered for performance, but whether family blockholders had a governance role. Large active blockholders tended to increase operating performance, implying that they reduced managerial expropriation. Contrastingly, we find that directors who were independent of large owners were more likely to increase shareholder value.;2016;Corporate Ownership, Control, and Firm Performance in Victorian Britain;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"ALFANI, GUIDO; Ryckbosch, Wouter";This article provides a comparison of long-term changes in inequality in two key areas of preindustrial Europe: Central-Northern Italy and the Low Countries. Based on new archival material, we reconstruct regional estimates of economic inequality during 1500–1800 and use them to assess the role of economic growth, social-demographic variables, proletarianization, and institutions. We argue that different explanations should be invoked to understand the early modern growth of inequality throughout Europe since several factors conspired to make for a society in which it was much easier for inequality to rise than to fall. Although long-term trends in economic inequality were apparently similar across the continent, divergence occurred in terms of inequality extraction ratios.;2016;Growing apart in early modern Europe?

"Alvarez-Nogal, Carlos; La Prados De Escosura, Leandro; Santiago Caballero, Carlos";This paper explores the role of agriculture in Spain's contribution to the little divergence in Europe. On the basis of tithes, long-run trends in agricultural output are drawn. After a long period of relative stability, output suffered a severe contraction during 1570–1620, followed by stagnation to 1650, and steady expansion thereafter. Output per head shifted from a relatively high to a low path that persisted until the nineteenth century. The decline in agricultural output per head and per worker from a relatively high level contributed to Spain falling behind and, hence, to the Little Divergence in Europe. Output per worker moved along labour force in agriculture over the long run, supporting the depiction of Spain as a frontier economy. Institutional factors, in a context of financial and monetary instability and war, along climatic anomalies, provide explanatory hypotheses that deserve further research.;2016;Spanish agriculture in the little divergence;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Antipa, Pamfili M.;For almost 25 years between 1797 and 1821, the gold standard in Britain was suspended in order to finance the Napoleonic Wars, creating a paper pound or a fiat currency. Suspension was accompanied by substantial inflation and the accumulation of public debt. By identifying shifts in the spot exchange rate of paper pounds for gold, I document how contemporaries' expectations of how debt would be stabilized in the future shaped the pound's internal value. Thus, it is argued that during the “paper pound” period, fiscal prospects provided a third mechanism, beyond monetary and real factors, affecting the price level.;2016;How Fiscal Policy Affects Prices: Britain's First Experience with Paper Money;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Arruñada, Benito;Impersonal exchange increases trade and specialization opportunities, encouraging economic growth. However, it requires the support of sophisticated public institutions. This paper explains how Classical Rome provided such support in the main areas of economic activity by relying on public possession as a titling device, enacting rules to protect innocent acquirers in agency contexts, enabling the extended family to act as a contractual entity, and diluting the enforcement of personal obligations which might collide with impersonal exchange. Focusing on the institutions of impersonal exchange, it reaches a clear positive conclusion on the market-facilitating role of the Roman state because such institutions have unambiguously positive effects on markets. Moreover, being impersonal, these beneficial effects are also widely distributed across society instead of accruing disproportionately to better-connected individuals.;2016;How Rome enabled impersonal markets;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Arthi, Vellore; FENSKE, JAMES";We use a year-long panel of time-use data from colonial Nigeria to show that labor complementarities and strategic concerns shaped the time-use decisions of African households. Using quantitative and ethnographic approaches, we show that health shocks imposed time costs that followed the gender division of labor. The labor of others did not automatically compensate for this. Whether individuals could respond by recruiting substitutes depended on social standing, urgency of work, and type of illness. Labor was coordinated between spouses. Child labor was coordinated with parental work, aided child care, and allowed children to build skills and resources.;2016;Intra-household labor allocation in colonial Nigeria;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Bailey, Roy E.; Hatton, Timothy J.; Inwood, Kris";"This article examines the health and height of men born in England and Wales in the 1890s who enlisted in the army at the time of the First World War, using a sample of recruits from the army service records. These are linked to their childhood circumstances as observed in the 1901 census. Econometric results indicate that height on enlistment was positively related to socio-economic class, and negatively to the number of children in the household in 1901 and the proportion of household members who were earners, as well as to the degree of crowding. Adding the characteristics of the locality has little effect on the household-level effects. However local conditions were important; in particular the industrial character of the district, local housing conditions, and the female illiteracy rate. These are interpreted as representing the negative effect on height of the local disease environment. The results suggest that changing conditions at both household and locality levels contributed to the increase in height and health in the following decades.";2016;Health, height, and the household at the turn of the twentieth century;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Barry, Frank; Barry, Linda; Menton, Aisling";The Committee on Industrial Organisation was established in the early 1960s to evaluate the level of preparedness of Irish industry for the imminent dismantling of the country's protectionist trade barriers. The Committee's sectoral reports list the 900 or so manufacturing firms that it surveyed and that together accounted for more than half of Irish manufacturing employment. From a range of archival sources, this article identifies the nationality of ownership of most of these firms, alongside their date of establishment and level of employment in 1960. Industrial grants data are used to strip out export-oriented businesses that began to arrive in the 1950s. This makes it possible to estimate the employment share and sectoral presence of tariff-jumping foreign firms. The latter is analysed through the lens of modern perspectives on foreign direct investment. The article also enhances our understanding of the interest-group politics of the trade liberalization process.;2016;Tariff-jumping foreign direct investment in protectionist era Ireland;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Bazot, Guillaume; Bordo, Michael D.; Monnet, Eric";Under the classical gold standard (1880–1914), the Bank of France maintained a stable discount rate while the Bank of England changed its rate very frequently. Why did the policies of these central banks, the two pillars of the gold standard, differ so much? How did the Bank of France manage to keep a stable rate despite international constraints? This paper tackles these questions and shows that the domestic asset portfolio of the Bank of France played a crucial role in smoothing international shocks and in maintaining the stability of the discount rate. As a result, the French discount rate was only changed in exceptional circumstances, for which a change in the English rate was not a sufficient condition.;2016;International shocks and the balance sheet of the Bank of France under the classical gold standard;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Beach, Brian; Ferrie, Joseph P.; Saavedra, Martin; Troesken, Werner";New water purification technologies led to large mortality declines by helping eliminate typhoid fever and other waterborne diseases. We examine how this affected human capital formation using early-life typhoid fatality rates to proxy for water quality. We merge city-level data to individuals linked between the 1900 and 1940 Censuses. Eliminating early-life exposure to typhoid fever increased later-life earnings by one percent and educational attainment by one month. Instrumenting for typhoid fever using typhoid rates from cities that lie upstream produces results nine times larger. The increase in earnings from eliminating typhoid fever more than offset the cost of elimination.;2016;Typhoid Fever, Water Quality, and Human Capital Formation;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Beaudreau, Bernard C.;The National Industrial Recovery Act purportedly failed because it raised real wages and lowered employment. Beaudreau on the other hand argued that it should be seen as a policy response to technological change-based excess capacity and insufficient purchasing power. However, if wages lagged behind productivity growth, why did the National Industrial Recovery Act fail to increase employment and output? This article shows that the chosen policy instruments (e.g., Codes of Fair Competition and the President's Reemployment Agreement), and not the objectives, were among the causes of its demise. Across-the-board wage increases in the presence of firm and industry heterogeneity contributed to its demise.;2016;Why did the National Industrial Recovery Act fail?;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Specifically, we investigate how quickly news is reflected in prices for two of the great moneyed companies, the Bank of England and the East India Company, over the period 1723–1794. These British companies were cross-listed on the London and Amsterdam stock exchange and news between the capitals flowed mainly via the use of boats that transported mail. We examine in detail the historical context surrounding the defining events of the period and use these as a guide to how the data should be analysed. We show that both trading venues contributed to price discovery, and although the London venue was more important for these stocks, its importance varies over time.;2016;Time-varying price discovery in the eighteenth century: empirical evidence from the London and Amsterdam stock markets;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Bellou, Andriana; Cardia, Emanuela";WWII mobilization led to a permanent increase in female employment. Using Census micro data we study the effects of this increase on the occupations women held after the war. Almost three decades after its end, WWII had lasting effects on the occupational landscape. For women of working age in the early 1940s, the war caused a permanent shift towards blue-collar occupations – particularly in manufacturing and service jobs – and a decline in employment in white-collar jobs. A reduction in educational attainment due to the draft, accumulation of occupation-specific experience and relatively high wages in blue-collar sectors can largely account for these patterns. WWII mobilization also influenced the occupational outcomes of the next generation of women who were too young to be working at the time of the war. This cohort shifted away from lower-skill jobs and towards clerical occupations.;2016;Occupations after WWII: The legacy of Rosie the Riveter;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Bennett, Robert J.;This article gives the first large-scale assessment of business partnerships in England and Wales using business records within the population census for 1881. It seeks to understand the variety of ways that ?partnership? was used: explicit partnership, ?de facto? partnership, ?joint? activity, and asset ownership together. The article confirms that partnerships were chiefly between two people. Complexity and transaction costs largely precluded larger size and squeezed the partnership into a ?middle ground? between the sole proprietor and the corporation. The main size contrast was between farms with small employee numbers, and larger non-farm business partnerships. Generally differences in the gender of business owners have greater salience than sectors. Few female business partnerships employed more than four people (mean 3.4), while male partnerships ranged up to several thousand employees (mean 33.6), and 18.6 for mixed gender. While many women were involved in businesses, their opportunities remained restricted, and most were in partnership with male partners. Family structures were important, with three-quarters of all identifiable partnerships having some form of family relationship, with a strong preponderance of single women in female-only partnerships, married men in male-only partnerships, and widows in mixed gender businesses.;2016;Interpreting business partnerships in late Victorian Britain†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Betrán, Concepción; Huberman, Michael";We pose a seemingly ageless question in economic history. To what extent did new entrants in the late nineteenth-century cotton-textile industry threaten the customary markets of the European core? Exploiting a newly constructed dataset on textile imports to Spain, we find that as trade costs fell, new rivals began to sell a greater variety of products. Along this dimension, competition can be said to have increased. In response, producers in Europe adjusted the type and number of goods exported. By 1914, specialization mapped onto endowments of skilled labour, capital, and access to raw materials. While firms in new industrializing countries exported low-end varieties, incumbents in the core shipped high-end goods, unit values increasing with levels of development.;2016;International competition in the first wave of globalization: new evidence on the margins of trade;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Bodenhorn, Howard;"Prison crowding is a pervasive modern problem with deep historical roots. The long-term solution to crowding has been more prisons; the short-term solution is early release. Early release programs can be effective when they balance the savings of reduced prison costs against the costs of recidivism by released convicts. This paper uses historical data to investigate how prison officials altered their early release policies in the face of prison crowding and rising real detention costs. The empirical evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that prison officials make use of information about the risks of recidivism revealed at trial and during incarceration to make informed decisions about whom to release and when.";2016;Prison crowding, recidivism, and early release in early Rhode Island;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Bolt, Jutta; Hillbom, Ellen";This article contributes to the growing literature on colonial legacies influencing long-term development. It focuses on Botswana, a case where the post-independence diamond-led economy has been considered an economic success story, despite its high levels of inequality. Here it is argued that this pathway of rapid resource-driven growth combined with increasing socio-economic inequality had already started during the time of the colonial cattle economy, and that this older case is equally relevant for understanding long-term growth-inequality trends in Botswana and other natural-resource-dependent economies. Six social tables, covering the period 1921 to 1974, are constructed using colonial archives, government statistics, and anthropological records. Based on the social tables, income inequality is estimated in the colonial and early post-independence eras, capturing both the formal and informal sectors of the economy. The article demonstrates how the creation of a cattle export sector in the 1930s brought new opportunities to access export incomes, and how this led to a polarization in cattle holdings and increasing income inequalities. Further, with the expansion of colonial administration, government wages forged ahead, increasing income inequality and causing a growing income divide between public and private formal employment.;2016;Long-term trends in economic inequality: lessons from colonial Botswana, 1921–74;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Bromhead, Alan de; Borowiecki, Karol Jan";This article analyses the determinants of the demand for life insurance using sample data from the 1911 Census of Canada. We find that immigrants' demand for life insurance was on average around 13 percentage points lower than that of native-born Canadians, with the effect varying by province of settlement. We interpret these findings as evidence suggesting a greater appetite for risk among self-selecting immigrants relative to native-born Canadians. We also uncover evidence of a slow assimilation of immigrants in terms of life insurance holdings, slower indeed than the process of assimilation in terms of earnings.;2016;Immigration and the demand for life insurance: evidence from Canada, 1911;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"BUELENS, FRANS; Frankema, Ewout";How profitable were foreign investments in plantation agriculture in the Netherlands Indies during the late colonial era? We use a new dataset of monthly quoted stock prices and dividends of international companies at the Brussels stock exchange to estimate the returns to investment in tropical agriculture (1919–1938). We adopt the Dimson–March–Staunton method to compute real geometric annual average rates of return and assess our estimates in an international comparative perspective. We find that returns to colonial FDI in the Netherlands Indies during 1919–1928 were impressive (14.3 %), being almost 3 percentage points higher than the world average. In the following decade 1929–1938 fortunes reversed, with a rate of return of −2.8 % compared to a world average of 2.2 %. Over the entire period the returns to colonial FDI (5.4 % in 1919–1938) were about a factor 2.5 higher than returns to investment in the Dutch domestic economy (2.1 % in 1920–1939). We argue that these returns should be interpreted in a colonial context of systematic labour repression, but that they may also partly reflect a higher risk-premium of investments in colonial commodities.;2016;Colonial adventures in tropical agriculture: new estimates of returns to investment in the Netherlands Indies, 1919–1938;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Cappelli, Gabriele;The role played by public policy in the development of Italy's human capital in the late nineteenth century and the Interwar period has long remained unexplored by quantitative economic history. This article explores whether a system of decentralized primary education slowed down regional convergence in schooling, since poor and backward areas could not afford to invest a suitable amount of resources in education. It also investigates whether a more centralized system introduced in 1911 fostered the development of basic education and reduced the country's regional disparities. The analysis confirms the existence of such a human capital trap and shows that centralized primary education fostered the development of Italy's schooling in the Interwar period.;2016;Escaping from a human capital trap?

Cappelli, Gabriele;"Italy’s regions experienced different rates of human capital accumulation in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Although southern regions were very disadvantaged when the unification of the country took place in 1861, they caught up at a very slow pace—and a remarkable regional divide in education persisted until the interwar period. While previous hypotheses have focused on the role played by fiscal capacity, this paper sheds new light on the effect that enfranchisement had on the growth of schooling. The presence of large regional disparities in local electoral franchise is confirmed by the data; however, the relationship between voting rights, the intensity of local direct taxation and municipal fiscal capacity is weak at best. Furthermore, if the impact of these factors is analysed separately through a number of econometric models, fiscal capacity stands out as the most significant determinant of education across Italy’s provinces. Against recent hypotheses, these results show that the different distribution of political voice within Italy’s municipalities did not determine the persistence of regional inequalities in schooling in the long run: it was Italy’s national education system, together with remarkable and pre-existent regional disparities, that slowed down the development of human capital in rural and southern regions, with immense costs in terms of future prospects for economic growth and human development.";2016;One size that didn’t fit all?

"Casson, Catherine; Casson, Mark";Although medieval rentals have been extensively studied, few scholars have used them to analyse variations in the rents paid on individual properties within a town. It has been claimed that medieval rents did not reflect economic values or market forces, but were set according to social and political rather than economic criteria, and remained ossified at customary levels. This article uses hedonic regression methods to test whether property rents in medieval Gloucester were influenced by classic economic factors such as the location and use of a property. It investigates both ordinary commercial rents and burgage rents (landgable), and explores the relationship between the two. It also examines spatial autocorrelation. It finds significant relationships between ordinary rents and property characteristics that are similar to those found in modern studies. The findings are consistent with the view that, in late medieval Gloucester at least, ordinary rents were strongly influenced by classical economic factors working through the urban property market. The findings also suggest that burgage rents reflected economic factors, even though they remained fixed over time.;2016;Location, location, location?

It was primarily a real barter asset and not a fiat currency. The liquidity premium was positively related to the amount of paper money per capita in circulation. This paper money traded below face value due to time-discounting, rather than depreciation.

"Cifarelli, Giulio; Paesani, Paolo";In the 1920s and 1930s, empirical studies of cotton futures pricing tend to attribute market fluctuations to shifts in fundamentals. In this paper, we qualify this view focusing on the role of speculation. Our research is based on a nonlinear heterogeneous agents model which posits the existence of two categories of speculators, feedback traders and fundamentalists, who react (differently) to deviations of market prices from their fundamental value. The analysis is based on original data drawn from the online archives of The Times and on an historical description of the working of a staple commodity market. The empirical findings allow us to conclude that whereas feedback traders tend to herd, fundamentalists are more affected by risk aversion and react but slowly to the underpricing/overpricing of the cotton contracts. As expected, the presence of fundamentalists stabilizes the market even if, at least in the time period under investigation, the behavior of feedback traders is the major driver of short-run price dynamics.;2016;Speculative pricing in the Liverpool cotton futures market: a nonlinear tale of noise traders and fundamentalists from the 1920s;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Colson, Justin;The economic geography of cities is often thought to have changed dramatically between the medieval and early modern eras. The medieval city is seen as having been strictly regulated, both in terms of markets, and in terms of space. The early modern city, by contrast, is associated not only with growth, but with the breakdown of rigid regulation by guilds and a new commercial outlook. However, empirical studies of the spatial organization of medieval cities have been limited, and quantitative surveys of urban economic geography have focused on the seventeenth century and later. This article analyses the spatial distribution of occupations in the City of London between the 1370s and the 1550s using a large probate dataset. It examines occupations that remained clustered or dispersed, but concentrates on the apparent breakdown in economic clustering among London's leading trades. Prosopographical analysis reveals that merchants and retailers became more specialized, but that this was accommodated within London's existing guild-based occupational identities, which had become ossified. Rather than the end of the middle ages having marked a dramatic change from guild-based spatial organisation, occupational clusters simply continued to evolve in line with the principles of locational economics throughout the period.;2016;Commerce, clusters, and community: a re-evaluation of the occupational geography of London, c. 1400–c. 1550;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Cummins, Neil; Kelly, Morgan; Ó Gráda, Cormac";This article uses individual records of 930,000 burials and 630,000 baptisms to reconstruct the spatial and temporal patterns of birth and death in London from 1560 to 1665, a period dominated by recurrent plague. The plagues of 1563, 1603, 1625, and 1665 appear of roughly equal magnitude, with deaths running at five to six times their usual rate, but the impact on wealthier central parishes falls markedly through time. Tracking the weekly spread of plague, we find no evidence that plague emerged first in the docks, and in many cases elevated mortality emerges first in the poor northern suburbs. Looking at the seasonal pattern of mortality, we find that the characteristic autumn spike associated with plague continued into the early 1700s. Natural increase improved as smaller crises disappeared after 1590, but fewer than half of those born survived childhood.;2016;Living standards and plague in London, 1560–1665;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Dao, Nguyen Thang;This article advances a theory to show that geographical advantage for agricultural production helps an economy to become more prosperous in the predominantly agricultural regime, but delays the timing of transition to manufacturing production (i.e., the timing of industrialization). It also delays the change in labor structure toward an increase in proportion of skilled labor, and hence, the economy may be overtaken in the development process by another with less geographical advantage for agriculture. This theoretical result is in accordance with recent empirical evidence and helps explain the reversals of national fortune, which are documented in economic history. Within its analytical framework, the article also enriches the existing literature by explaining the decline in fertility and the evolution of labor structure, along with technological progress, in the development process.;2016;From agriculture to manufacturing: How does geography matter?;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Davenport, Romola J.; Boulton, Jeremy; SCHWARZ, LEONARD";Smallpox was probably the single most lethal disease in eighteenth-century Britain but was reduced to a minor cause of death by the mid-nineteenth century due to vaccination programmes post-1798. While the success of vaccination is unquestionable, it remains disputed to what extent the prophylactic precursor of vaccination, inoculation, reduced smallpox mortality in the eighteenth century. Smallpox was most lethal in urban populations, but most researchers have judged inoculation to have been unpopular in large towns. Recently, however, Razzell argued that inoculation significantly reduced smallpox mortality of adults and older children in London in the last third of the eighteenth century. This article uses demographic evidence from London and Manchester to confirm previous findings of a sudden fall in adult smallpox mortality and a rise in the importance of smallpox in early childhood c. 1770. The nature of these changes is consistent with an increase in smallpox transmission in London and Manchester after 1770 and indicates that smallpox inoculation was insufficient to reduce smallpox mortality in large towns. It remains unclear whether inoculation could have operated to enhance smallpox transmission or whether changes in the properties of the smallpox virus drove the intensification of smallpox mortality among young children post-1770.;2016;Urban inoculation and the decline of smallpox mortality in eighteenth-century cities—a reply to Razzell;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Deloof, Marc; Vermoesen, Veronique";We investigate how board characteristics were related to the value of listed Belgian firms in the 1928–1931 period, when investor protection was weak and firms were hit by the largest financial crisis of the 20th century. We find that firms typically had a large board and many directors held multiple directorships. Most boards included bank directors. While large, busy boards and bankers on the board were positively related to firm value before the crisis, their value significantly decreased from 1929 onwards, suggesting that these boards were less suited to face a crisis. Board busyness seems to be the main driver of negative board effects during the crisis. We also find that riskier firms which had busier and larger boards experienced a larger drop in value.;2016;The value of corporate boards during the Great Depression in Belgium;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Deng, Kent; O'Brien, Patrick K.";This article is a survey and critique of recent endeavours to establish statistical foundations for a chronology for the great divergence based upon trends and levels in relative wages. Our reading of the bibliography in Chinese labour history, together with a preliminary investigation into other primary sources, suggests that the Kuznetsian paradigm for empirical economics may not be viable for the construction of analytical narratives for the Chinese and other premodern imperial economies in South and West Asia. Nevertheless, two datasets currently in print will continue to be quoted to lend support to numerically grounded speculations for levels and trends in real wages and welfare for the families of wage-dependent urban workers in China over the eighteenth century. Statistical evidence for the Ming and Qing dynasties calibrated for the purposes of comparing real wage levels for wage-dependent labour between China and western Europe can, however, be placed on a spectrum for accuracy and inferential analysis that runs from ?unfounded guess work? to ?plausible conjectures?. The unwelcome contention of this article is that the data published and potentially available for China (and probably for India and the Ottoman Empire) stand close to the unfounded guess work end of that spectrum. Meanwhile, and as a speculative conclusion, we offer a conjecture that the ?real wages? for Qing China's tiny proletariat, whose income included high proportions of wages in kind, have remained as elusive as they were when the real wage debate began a decade ago.;2016;Establishing statistical foundations of a chronology for the great divergence: a survey and critique of the primary sources for the construction of relative wage levels for Ming–Qing China;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Di Matteo, Livio;A link between religion, estate division behavior, and economic inequality is demonstrated. Economic inequality varied across religious affiliations in early twentieth century Canada. Wealth inequality was higher for Anglicans and Roman Catholics relative to Presbyterians. Earnings inequality was higher for Anglicans and Presbyterians relative to Baptists and Catholics. In explaining differences in wealth inequality, estate division differences across religions are a factor with partibility associated with less inequality. However, these differences cannot be neatly categorized into watertight compartments according to the effects of differences in salvific merit or liberal/conservative divides suggesting the simple act of belonging had important network effects.;2016;All equal in the sight of God: economic inequality and religion in the early twentieth century;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Edwards, Peter;In 1716 Edward Lord Harley took possession of one the country's most iconic studs when his wife, Henrietta, inherited Welbeck Abbey (Nottinghamshire) on the death of her mother. At the time, the stud, made famous by her great grandfather, William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle, was in temporary eclipse and run down. He resolved to restore its fortunes. However, beset by debts and with other expensive interests to distract him, including the purchase of books and manuscripts, he allowed the stud to decay, winding it up just over a decade later. With careful management and sound, timely investment, Harley could have restored its fortunes. However, he hoped to re-establish the stud ?on the cheap?, utilizing the top class stallions and mares he had at his disposal to produce first-rate foals, from which he would select the best as replacements. Sadly, too few of the foals came up to expectations. In vain, his agent advised him to retire the ageing mares and invest in suitable replacements. His failure to do so soon impacted on the quality and the number of horses produced. Inevitably, he failed, providing contemporaries and historians alike with an object lesson on how not to run a ?top-end? stud.;2016;The decline of an aristocratic stud: the stud of Edward Lord Harley, 2nd Earl of Oxford and Mortimer, at Welbeck (Nottinghamshire), 1717–29;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Eli, Shari; Salisbury, Laura";Beginning in the 1880s, southern states introduced pensions for Confederate veterans and widows. They expanded these programs through the 1920s, while states outside the region were introducing cash transfer programs for workers, poor mothers, and the elderly. Using pension application records and county-level electoral data, we argue that political considerations guided the distribution of these pensions. We show that Confederate pension programs were funded during years in which Democratic gubernatorial candidates were threatened at the ballot box. Moreover, we show that pensions were disbursed to counties in which these candidates had lost ground to candidates from alternative parties.;2016;Patronage Politics and the Development of the Welfare State: Confederate Pensions in the American South;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Feigenbaum, James J.; Muller, Christopher";In the second half of the nineteenth century, many American cities built water systems using lead or iron service pipes. Municipal water systems generated significant public health improvements, but these improvements may have been partially offset by the damaging effects of lead exposure through lead water pipes. We study the effect of cities' use of lead pipes on homicide between 1921 and 1936. Lead water pipes exposed entire city populations to much higher doses of lead than have previously been studied in relation to crime. Our estimates suggest that cities' use of lead service pipes considerably increased city-level homicide rates.;2016;Lead exposure and violent crime in the early twentieth century;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The strongest response was in the highly skilled mechanical trades.

FELIPE Zegarra, Luis;This article analyzes the effects of political instability on the provision of credit in 1835–1865, paying special attention to non-price loan terms. By relying on a sample of more than 1,700 notarized records, the article shows that political instability had an important effect on the amount and length of loans. As Peru became politically more stable after the mid-1840s, private lenders made larger loans with longer maturities. Medium-term credit among approved loans was more frequent after political stabilization. Long-term credit, however, was not common during this period.;2016;Political instability and non-price loan terms in Lima, Peru: evidence from notarized contracts;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Fernández, Eva;This article studies the political determinants of agricultural policies in twelve Western countries based on new estimates of support of farmers during the period from 1920 to 1975. In continental Europe, the rapid growth of agricultural support after 1955 was driven by the combination of the rapid decline in the size of agriculture, the relative agricultural comparative disadvantage, and the high frequency of coalition governments that resulted from the proportional electoral systems. During the interwar period, agricultural support depended on the presence of authoritarian regimes and economic downturns in the 1920s and 1930s induced politicians to increase support.;2016;Politics, coalitions, and support of farmers, 1920–1975;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

This variation does not appear to be correlated with underlying trends also driving home ownership.

"Flores Zendejas, Juan H.; Decorzant, Yann";Why are international financial institutions important? This article reassesses the role of the loans issued with the support of the League of Nations. These long-term loans constituted the financial basis of the League's strategy to restore the productive basis of countries in central and eastern Europe in the aftermath of the First World War. In this article, it is argued that the League's loans accomplished the task for which they were conceived because they allowed countries in financial distress to access capital markets. The League adopted an innovative system of funds management and monitoring that ensured the compliance of borrowing countries with its programmes. Empirical evidence is provided to show that financial markets had a positive view of the League's role as an external, multilateral agent, solving the credibility problem of borrowing countries and allowing them to engage in economic and institutional reforms. This success was achieved despite the League's own lack of lending resources. It is also demonstrated that this multilateral solution performed better than the bilateral arrangements adopted by other governments in eastern Europe because of its lower borrowing and transaction costs.;2016;Going multilateral?

During this period, the government increased public spending and made school attendance free and mandatory until the age of 13. The empirical analysis presented here suggests that greater public spending had no substantial effect on the enrolment in Catholic schools. By contrast, mandatory schooling laws had a negative, but quantitatively limited, impact. The overall resilience of Catholic schooling is traced to the political divide created by the 1789 French Revolution.;2016;Can public policies lower religiosity?

"GEARY, FRANK; Stark, Tom";"New estimates of regional GDP for Great Britain in the twentieth century differ from those of Crafts but confirm his hypothesis of a U-shaped regional inequality curve between 1911 and 2001. Comparison of these estimates with revised estimates for 1861?1911 suggests that the decline in inequality in the first half of the twentieth century forms part of a trend of declining regional inequality and catch-up of the poorer regions with the richest (the South East) dating back to the 1860s at least. This convergence trend was interrupted by the First World War and the subsequent difficulties of Outer Britain in the 1920s when the gap between the South East and the rest widened. However, sometime after 1931 it picked up again. Since 1971 inequality has worsened and catch-up has stopped; indeed, there has been divergence of the South East from the rest. This divergence has been especially marked since 1991. Although growth for all regions was faster during the period of increasing regional inequality that encompasses the second half of the twentieth century, the golden age of economic growth for regions outside the South East occurred during the long boom following the Second World War.";2016;What happened to regional inequality in Britain in the twentieth century?;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Gelderblom, Oscar; Jonker, Joost; Kool, Clemens J.M.";This article analyses private credit operations in Amsterdam in the seventeenth century to explain the absence of deposit banks. The financial system was highly segmented and a combination of declining business margins and narrow interest rate spreads cut the scope for deposit taking. Moreover, merchants had easy access to credit in the form of short-term loans which could be easily rolled over, or replaced at will.

It was argued that, as a small open economy, prices were determined externally. To test this relationship, we study the determination of inflation between 1926 and 2012, a longer sample period than any previously used. We find that the difference between unemployment and the NAIRU is a significant determinant of inflation both in the full sample and in the subsamples spanning the periods before and after the Sterling parity link.;2016;Unemployment and inflation in Ireland: 1926–2012;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Gorlizki, Yoram;Recent work on dictatorship has focused on how repression is used by dictators to eradicate political opposition. This article examines evidence from one of the most important dictatorships of the twentieth century to suggest that this may tell only half the story. As Stalin's dictatorship progressed, repression was increasingly administered neither by the secret police nor the military?as in most dictatorships?but through the ordinary courts. The article proposes an explanation, one broadly consistent with Olson's hypothesis that Stalin was a ?proprietary dictator?, an autocrat with a long time horizon who made major investments in public goods. Stalin's new form of property??socialist property'?was one such public good. To legitimize the new form of ownership, Stalin ruled that it should be enforced through the ordinary justice system, albeit initially with high levels of repression. The article also makes two further contributions. It shows, first, how Stalin's theft campaigns are a striking historical example of what happens when an unpopular law clashes with social norms, and of how it might backfire. Second, it demonstrates how, as property rights theorists would predict, the main objects of theft legislation are generic or homogeneous goods with few property attributes.;2016;Theft under Stalin: a property rights analysis;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Our analysis of panel data shows that the appointment of connected directors did not increase equity returns (as measured by the capital gain plus dividend yield on bank shares). In fact, we find that the appointment of MPs to directorships had negative effects on bank equity returns. Our event-study analysis corroborates this finding, showing that a bank's shares exhibited negative abnormal returns when their directors were elected to Parliament. Taken together, our results indicate that connected directors yielded little – or even negative – economic payoff to bank shareholders in pre-war Britain.;2016;Taking the lord's name in vain: The impact of connected directors on 19th century British banks;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Where market regulation in open societies is commonly intended to improve market transparency, competition, and fair treatment of consumers and employees, KGB regulation was designed to enforce secrecy, monopoly, and discrimination. One consequence of KGB regulation of the labour market may have been adverse selection for talent.

Hausman, Joshua K.;This article shows that there were timing, geographic, and sectoral anomalies in the 1937/38 recession, none of which are easily explained by aggregate shocks. I argue that an auto industry supply shock contributed both to the recession's anomalies and to its severity. Labor-strife-induced wage increases and an increase in raw material costs led auto manufacturers to raise prices in fall 1937. Expectations of these price increases brought auto sales forward. When auto prices finally rose, sales plummeted. This shock likely reduced 1938 auto sales by roughly 600,000 units and 1938 GDP growth by 0.5–1 percentage point.;2016;What Was Bad for General Motors Was Bad for America: The Automobile Industry and the 1937/38 Recession;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Henrekson, Magnus; Waldenström, Daniel";This article studies the evolution of Swedish inheritance taxation since the late nineteenth century to its abolition in 2004. The contribution of this article is twofold. First, the annual effective inheritance tax rates are computed for different sizes of bequests and asset types, accounting for all relevant exemptions, deductions, and valuation discounts. Second, an attempt is made to explain changes in inheritance taxation over time. Ideology appears to be the main driver of the sharp tax increases of the 1930s to the 1960s. Wartime economies with higher pressures on the people induced politicians to raise inheritance taxes on the wealthy, primarily during the First World War. Increased opportunities for tax planning for the wealthy are also documented, most notably a series of tax cuts on inherited family firms in the 1970s. This rise in avoidance opportunities for the rich, while middle-class heirs faced growing inheritance tax rates, undermined the legitimacy of the tax and led to its repeal.;2016;Inheritance taxation in Sweden, 1885–2004: the role of ideology, family firms, and tax avoidance;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Henriques, Sofia Teives; Sharp, Paul Richard";This article examines the case of Denmark?a country which historically had next to no domestic energy resources?for which new historical energy accounts are presented for the years 1800?1913. It demonstrates that Denmark's take-off at the end of the nineteenth century was relatively energy dependent. This is related to Denmark's well-known agricultural transformation and development through the dairy industry, and thus the article complements the literature which argues that expensive energy hindered industrialization, by arguing that similar obstacles would have precluded other countries from a more agriculture-based growth. The Danish cooperative creameries, which spread throughout the country over the last two decades of the nineteenth century, were dependent on coal. Although Denmark had next to no domestic coal deposits, this article demonstrates that Danish geography allowed cheap availability throughout the country through imports. On top of this it emphasizes that another important source of energy was imported feed for cows.;2016;The Danish agricultural revolution in an energy perspective: a case of development with few domestic energy sources;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Herranz-Loncán, Alfonso; Peres-Cajías, José Alejandro";In the centuries before the Spanish conquest, the Bolivian space was among the most highly urbanized and complex societies in the Americas. In contrast, in the early twenty-first century, Bolivia is one of the poorest economies on the continent. According to Acemoglu et al. (Q J Econ 117(4):1231–1294, 2002), this disparity between precolonial opulence and current poverty would make Bolivia a perfect example of “reversal of fortune” (RF). This hypothesis, however, has been criticized for oversimplifying long-term development processes by “compressing” history (Austin in J Int Dev 20:996–1027, 2008). In the case of Bolivia, a comprehensive description and explanation of the RF process would require a global approach to the entire postcolonial era, which has been prevented so far by the lack of quantitative information for the period before 1950. This paper aims to fill that gap by providing new income per capita estimates for Bolivia in 1890–1950 and a point guesstimate for the mid-nineteenth century. Our figures indicate that divergence has not been a persistent feature of Bolivian economic history. Instead, it was concentrated in the nineteenth century and the second half of the twentieth century, and it was actually during the latter that the country joined the ranks of the poorest economies in Latin America. By contrast, during the first half of the twentieth century, the country converged with both the industrialized and the richest Latin American economies. The Bolivian postcolonial era cannot therefore be described as one of sustained divergence. Instead, the Bolivian RF was largely the combined result of post-independence stagnation and the catastrophic crises of the late twentieth century.;2016;Tracing the reversal of fortune in the Americas: Bolivian GDP per capita since the mid-nineteenth century;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Imaizumi, Asuka; Ito, Kaori; OKAZAKI, TETSUJI";The Great Kantō Earthquake in 1923 did enormous damage to industries in Tokyo Prefecture. Around 40% of the buildings in Tokyo Prefecture were completely burnt or destroyed. In this paper, we investigate whether this temporary shock had a persistent impact on the spatial distribution of industries in Tokyo, using ward- and county-level panel data for industrial workers. It was found that while the earthquake caused mean shifts in the shares and numbers of workers, these mean shifts disappeared by the early 1930s. On the other hand, the earthquake caused shifts in the trends in the share and number of workers. The combined effects of these mean shifts and trend shifts were persistent for both the shares and the numbers of workers. The earthquake caused especially serious damage to the old industrial clusters in the southeast of Tokyo, and provided an opportunity for newly developing industrial clusters in non-damaged areas to take over the market. Further, the people and the local governments in non-damaged areas made an effort to take advantage of this opportunity to attract factories. Arguably, these forces made the impact of the earthquake on the spatial distribution of industry persistent.;2016;Impact of natural disasters on industrial agglomeration: The case of the Great Kantō Earthquake in 1923;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Iordanou, Ioanna;"The labouring classes of early modern Venice, the popolani, made up nearly 90 per cent of the city's population. To this point the relevant historiography has focused almost exclusively on their professional and civic role. It is the core contention of this article that the contribution of the popolani to the Venetian economy and society far exceeded their documented professional and civic function. Using as a case study the homogeneous group of the shipbuilders and sailors of Venice and drawing on newly discovered primary sources from the Venetian State Archives, this article shows the distinct contributions of the popolani to the city's economy and society through their charity to those in need. This took the form of sizeable dotal and charitable donations within and beyond the family. In one of the first attempts to explore the philanthropy of the Venetian workforce, this article challenges the existing scholarly view that charity was the sole responsibility of the government and the nobility in early modern Venice. It further shows that marriage was not merely a financial union for the popolani; it was a sanctuary for lasting companionship. Ultimately, the article offers a fresh vista onto the socio-economic role of the popolani in early modern Venice.";2016;Pestilence, poverty, and provision: re-evaluating the role of the popolani in early modern Venice;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Ivanov, Denis;Do human capital endowments trump location for knowledge-intensive industries? This article takes advantage of a natural experiment created by the end of the Soviet planned economy in 1991, which had geographically distributed R&D manpower according to planned needs as opposed to a distribution determined by a market economy. It examines the extent to which the planned economy created a path-dependence in the location of post-Soviet human-capital intensive production. The study finds that regions with more R&D personnel in 1991 did better in the development of modern market-oriented knowledge-intensive business services, like engineering and IT.

First, by examining the historical news record and the forecasts of contemporary business analysts, we show that inflation expectations increased dramatically. Second, using an event-study approach, we identify the effect of the key events that shifted inflation expectations on financial markets. Third, we gather new evidence—both quantitative and narrative—that indicates that the shift in inflation expectations played a causal role in stimulating the recovery.;2016;Inflation expectations and recovery in spring 1933;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Jaremski, Matthew; Plastaras, Brady";Scholars have studied the US banking systems of the late nineteenth century, but the presence and influence of mutual savings banks has largely gone unexamined. A new annual database of New England banks shows that mutual savings banks had a significant presence in the postbellum banking system. Mutual savings banks accounted for about 75 % of the region’s total bank deposits and largely avoided financial panics. The banks seemed to have complemented rather than competed with national banks. Mutual savings bank growth was correlated with agriculture and urbanization, whereas national bank growth was correlated with manufacturing. Mutual savings banks also channeled significant funds to national banks through the interbank network.;2016;The competition and coexistence of mutual and commercial banks in New England, 1870–1914;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

JOPP, TOBIAS A.;Many public pension insurance schemes today use the pay-as-you-go financing mechanism. This mechanism is vulnerable to an ageing population, which puts pressure on the intergenerational contract implicit in these schemes and raises the question as to how they might be eroded. This is not a new problem, and to put it into historical perspective, this article studies the intergenerational contract that formed the core of the Prussian miners? invalidity insurance in the nineteenth and the early twentieth century (1861?1920). With the so-called Knappschaften, miners relied on what was probably the most comprehensive and advanced occupational pension system existing in Germany around the time when Bismarckian social insurance was established. Financed via the pay-as-you-go mechanism, the miners? pension funds faced stress from their ageing memberships early on, and this potentially undermined their ability to maintain intergenerationally fair pensions. In order to examine whether or not the intergenerational contract among German miners showed signs of erosion, we look at the Knappschaftens? profitability, as measured by actual and promised internal rates of return. This article shows that the intergenerational contract indeed weakened over time unless miners? funds were large and continued to grow, and that a pension reform in 1906 served to stabilize generosity.;2016;After us, the deluge: German miners’ experience with pay-as-you-go pensions and the intergenerational contract before the great inflation;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
JOPP, TOBIAS A.;Which events did contemporary investors deem important turning points in the First World War? We address this question by looking for structural breaks in the daily yields of six major belligerents' sovereign bonds traded in Amsterdam. Detected breaks are checked for robustness in an empirical model taking into account market liquidity, portfolio effects, exchange rates, short-term interest rates, and inflation. Twenty-two turning points are identified, all of which turn out to be robust. We identify the Central Powers' spring offensive beginning in late March 1918 and the allied answer starting in late summer 1918 as the major turning points.

JOPP, TOBIAS A.;The discussion of the rationalization wave in German industry (1924–1929) still lacks proper industry-level estimates of the rate of technological progress. To close part of this gap, this article investigates total factor productivity (TFP) growth in hard coal mining over the extended period 1913–1938. Stochastic Frontier Analysis is applied to a sample of firms from the Ruhr coal district. TFP grew positively overall and specifically from 1924–1929. Surprisingly, however, TFP growth was even faster from 1933–1938, suggesting that the Nazi economy heavily capitalized on the Weimar rationalization movement, the effects of which are usually not traced beyond 1932.;2016;How Technologically Progressive Was Germany in the Interwar Period?

Khan, B. Zorina;"The French economy has been criticized for a lack of integration of women in business and for the prevalence of inefficient family firms. A sample drawn from patent and exhibition records is used to examine the role of women in enterprise and invention in France. Middle-class women were extensively engaged in entrepreneurship and innovation, and the empirical analysis indicates that their commercial efforts were significantly enhanced by association with family firms. Such formerly invisible achievements suggest a more productive role for family-based enterprises, as a means of incorporating relatively disadvantaged groups into the market economy as managers and entrepreneurs.

Kholodilin, Konstantin A.;New archival evidence on housing rents in Berlin over 1909–1917 is presented. The data are extracted from newspaper announcements and georeferenced. Using hedonic regressions, quality-adjusted rent indices are constructed and employed to analyze the rental dynamics during World War I, when housing market experienced several shocks. The outbreak of the war led to an outflow of men from cities. Toward the end of the war, the construction freeze together with an inflow of workers and discharged soldiers resulted in a housing shortage. The analysis shows a rent decline (particularly for cheap dwellings) during the first half of the war, followed by a moderate increase. In 1917, given a dramatic overall price increase, real rents lost half of their value. Thus, regulatory policy did not emerge as a result of market failure, but rather the fear of rapid rent increases as a consequence of the supply stagnation despite growing housing demand.;2016;War, housing rents, and free market: Berlin's rental housing during World War I;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"KLEIN, ALEXANDER; OGILVIE, SHEILAGH";This article presents an analysis of occupational structure, a key component of the ?Little Divergence?, in an eastern-central European economy under the second serfdom, using data on 6,983 Bohemian villages in 1654. Non-agricultural activity was lower than in western Europe, but varied positively with village size, pastoral agriculture, sub-peasant strata, Jews, freemen, female headship, and mills, and negatively with arable agriculture and towns. It showed a curvilinear relationship with the ?second serfdom?, as proxied by landlord presence on village holdings. Landlord presence in serf villages also reversed the positive effects of female headship and mills on non-agricultural activities. Under the second serfdom, landlords encouraged serf activities from which they could extract rents, while stifling others which threatened manorial interests.;2016;Occupational structure in the Czech lands under the second serfdom;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
La Prados De Escosura, Leandro;Comparisons of economic performance over space and time largely depend on how statistical evidence from national accounts and historical estimates are spliced. To allow for changes in relative prices, GDP benchmark years in national accounts are periodically replaced with new and more recent ones. Thus, a homogeneous long-run GDP series requires linking different temporal segments of national accounts. The choice of the splicing procedure may result in substantial differences in GDP levels and growth, particularly as an economy undergoes deep structural transformation. An inadequate splicing may seriously bias the measurement of GDP levels and growth rates. Alternative splicing solutions are discussed in this paper for the particular case of Spain, a fast-growing country in the second half of the twentieth century. It is concluded that the usual linking procedure, retropolation, is seriously flawed as it tends to bias GDP levels upwards and, consequently, to underestimate growth rates, especially for developing countries experiencing structural change. An alternative interpolation procedure is proposed.;2016;Mismeasuring long-run growth: the bias from splicing national accounts—the case of Spain;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Lee, Woong;I use unique city-month level disaggregated data, from public employment offices, to estimate the matching functions for the 1920s and the early 1930s. The results show that the public labor exchange was slack, a relative deficiency of job vacancies, in the 1920s and it became slacker during the Great Depression. However, the findings show that there was no deterioration of the matching efficiency in the early 1930s. The outcome of a deficiency of labor demand during the 1930s implies that there was a need for effective government policies to implement the new job-creation programs.;2016;Slack and Slacker: Job Seekers, Job Vacancies, and Matching Functions in the U.S. Labor Market during the Roaring Twenties and the Great Contraction, 1924–1932;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Leng, Thomas;This article examines the role of merchant companies in structuring overseas trade in early modern Europe by considering the commerce of the Merchant Adventurers of England, the ?regulated? Company which monopolized the cloth export trade to Germany and the Netherlands in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. It examines the Company's trade to its German ?mart? town of Stade at the close of the sixteenth century through a detailed case study of the trade of one particular merchant, John Quarles. Using correspondence between Quarles and his factors overseas, it considers how membership of this regulated trading company impacted on the practice of its members, both through its formal regulatory regime and the informal pressures that came with corporate affiliation. However, corporate privileges also created ?shadow economies? inhabited by the excluded, those castigated by companies as ?interlopers?. The article considers the connections between interlopers and those ?disorderly brethren? of the company who were prepared to violate corporate regulations in pursuit of opportunities. It shows how the regulatory regimes of merchant companies were shaped by the changing practices of members and non-members as they responded to the structural changes facing European trade in the early modern period.;2016;Interlopers and disorderly brethren at the Stade Mart: commercial regulations and practices amongst the Merchant Adventurers of England in the late Elizabethan period;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Lindert, Peter H.; Williamson, Jeffrey G.";"New data now allow conjectures on the levels of real and nominal incomes in the 13 American colonies. New England was the poorest region, and the South was the richest. Colonial per capita incomes rose only very slowly if at all, for five reasons: productivity growth was slow; population in the low-income (but subsistence-plus) frontier grew much faster than that in the high-income coastal settlements; child dependency rates were high and probably even rising; the terms of trade were extremely volatile, presumably suppressing investment in export sectors; and the terms of trade rose very slowly, if at all, in the North, although faster in the South. All of this checked the growth of colony-wide per capita income after a seventeenth-century boom. The American colonies led Great Britain in purchasing power per capita from 1700, and possibly from 1650, until 1774, even counting slaves in the population. That is, average purchasing power in America led Britain early, when Americans were British. The common view that American per capita income did not overtake that of Britain until the start of the twentieth century appears to be off the mark by two centuries or more.";2016;American colonial incomes, 1650–1774;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Estimates of European and non-European GDP per capita for both South African colonies are also provided. Together, this information allows for the first time an evaluation of the growth performance of these important parts of the South African economy in the colonial era. The article concludes that South African performance in this period was stronger than often assumed and that by the beginning of the twentieth century European South Africans, now more fully integrated into a British World economy, operated at a level of GDP per capita that matched and in some places may have exceeded that of Australians.

Malinowski, Mikołaj;I contribute to the debate on the timing of the Little Divergence within pre-industrial Europe. I add Polish real wages to the comparative framework by comparing them with the English and Italian series. I compile existing data for Poznań, Lublin, and the Polish agricultural sector. I add this information to the internationally available evidence for Cracow, Gdańsk, Warsaw, and Lviv. I demonstrate that the more processed grains, i.e., beer and bread, feature in a basket used to deflate wages, the greater the observed superiority of London over the Polish cities. I also show that Poland was characterised by the widest income gap between the urban and rural sectors. I account for income differences between sectors by weighting the income series by occupational structures. The evidence suggests that England was richer than Poland by 1500. The countries converged around 1600. Subsequently, Poland began to lag behind from the seventeenth century onwards.;2016;Little Divergence revisited: Polish weighted real wages in a European perspective, 1500–1800;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Malinowski, Mikołaj;I investigate the relation between institutions, markets, and preindustrial economic growth. In particular, I analyze the impact of coercive agricultural class structures on urban population growth in Poland. My main point is that the impact of the demesne economy based on serfdom on urban growth was neither inherently negative nor positive. Instead, I suggest that the effect of serfdom depended on market conditions. I propose a new mechanism that explains how higher monetary and labor duties charged by landlords to their enserfed tenant farmers could have made urban settlements more resilient to a market crisis. I find empirical support for this idea with use of new database on urban settlements.;2016;Serfs and the city: market conditions, surplus extraction institutions, and urban growth in early modern Poland;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Martínez-Galarraga, Julio; Prat, Marc";Catalonia was the only Mediterranean region among the early followers of the British industrial revolution. The roots of this process can be traced back to the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries when the Catalan economy became integrated into international trade, and a successful printed calico industry concentrated in the city of Barcelona. Although the factory system was largely adopted by the cotton industry in the 1840s, the diffusion of the spinning jenny in Catalonia had occurred earlier, in the 1790s. In line with Allen, this article explores whether relative factor prices played a role in the widespread adoption of the spinning jenny in Catalonia. First, series of real wages in Barcelona are supplied for the period 1500?1808. Second, the prices of labour and capital are compared and the potential profitability of the adoption of the spinning jenny is analysed. Findings show that although Catalonia was not a high wage economy in the way that Britain was in the second half of the eighteenth century, evidence from the cotton spinning sector confirms the relevance of relative factor prices in the adoption of new technology. Within the booming cotton sector after the 1780s, high wages created strong incentives for the adoption of the labour-saving spinning jenny.;2016;Wages, prices, and technology in early Catalan industrialization;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Massey, Catherine G.;Several factors influenced the composition of migrants in the early 20th century, including World War I, the Literacy Act of 1917, and the implementation of strict immigration quotas. This paper examines whether the United States' first immigration quota, established under the Emergency Immigration Act of 1921, affected migrant selection. The Emergency Immigration Act of 1921 severely capped the number of admittable migrants by nationality. Canadian migrants, or any migrants who resided in Canada for five consecutive years, were unrestricted by the quota and could freely migrate to the U.S. Using transcribed ship records from states bordering Canada (specifically New York, Alaska, and Washington), I compare the skills of restricted migrants to the skills of unrestricted Canadian migrants, before and after establishment of the 1921 quota. Difference-in-differences estimates indicate that the quota resulted in migrants of higher skill.;2016;Immigration quotas and immigrant selection;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The results provide evidence that any existence of a “resource curse” on local areas due to coal mining is a long-run phenomenon, and in the short run there are potential net benefits.;2016;Local Economic Impacts of Coal Mining in the United States 1870 to 1970;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Meier Zu Selhausen, Felix; Weisdorf, Jacob L.";The colonial legacy of African underdevelopment is widely debated but hard to document. In this article, occupational statistics from Protestant marriage registers of historical Kampala are used to investigate the hypothesis that African gender inequality and female disempowerment are rooted in colonial times. We find that the arrival of Europeans in Uganda ignited a century-long transformation of Kampala involving a gender Kuznets curve. Men rapidly acquired literacy and quickly found their way into white-collar (high-status) employment in the wage economy built by the Europeans. Women took somewhat longer to obtain literacy and considerably longer to enter into white-collar and waged work. This led to increased gender inequality during the first half of the colonial period. However, gender inequality gradually declined during the latter half of the colonial era, and after Uganda's independence in 1962 its level was not significantly different from that of pre-colonial times. The data presented here also support Boserup's view that gender inequality was rooted in indigenous social norms: daughters of African men who worked in the traditional, informal economy were less well-educated, less frequently employed in formal work, and more often subjected to marital gender inequality than daughters of men employed in the modernized, formal economy created by the Europeans.;2016;A colonial legacy of African gender inequality?

Melitz, Jacques;There have been important advances by archeologists and numismatists in recent decades in the study of the beginnings of coinage in Ionia, Lydia, and Greece before the fifth century B.C. This paper provides a model of the birth of coinage that brings these advances into a broad analysis of the subject-matter. It pulls together many factors that are often treated separately. In addition, the model yields one important new result. Contrary to popular assumption, early coinage was not highly profitable. The Lydian government and the Greek city-states provided an extremely wide array of denominations of coins in a single precious metal at considerable cost. Their willingness to bear this cost must have reflected a political strategy of promoting coinage. Such a political strategy would also be easy to explain. As a large payer and recipient of money in the form of precious metals, the government had much to gain from the spread of coinage in order to economize on transaction costs in its own affairs.;2016;A model of the beginnings of coinage in antiquity;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Missiaia, Anna;Italy has been characterized, throughout its unitary history, by large regional differentials in income, level of industrialization, and development. This article aims at testing the New Economic Geography hypothesis on the role of market access in explaining these regional differentials. We first quantify the market potentials of the Italian regions. We then use these estimates to study the causal link between GDP per capita and market potential. The main result of this article is that only domestic market potential, which represents the home market, shows a “traditional” North–South divide. When international markets are introduced, the South does not appear to lag behind. Regression analysis confirms that market potential is a strong determinant of GDP per capita only in its domestic formulation. This suggests that the home market in this period mattered far more for growth than the international markets, casting new light on one of the classical explanations to the North–South divide.;2016;Where do we go from here?

"Molitoris, Joseph; Dribe, Martin";This work combines economic and demographic data to examine inequality of living standards in Stockholm at the turn of the twentieth century. Using a longitudinal population register with occupational information, we utilize event-history models to show that despite absolute decreases in mortality, relative differences between socioeconomic groups remained virtually constant. The results also show that child mortality continued to be sensitive to short-term fluctuations in wages and that there were no socioeconomic differences in this response. We argue that the persistent inequality in living standards was possibly due to differences in residential patterns and nutrition.;2016;Industrialization and inequality revisited: mortality differentials and vulnerability to economic stress in Stockholm, 1878–1926;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Molitoris, Joseph; Dribe, Martin";The western fertility decline is arguably the most significant demographic change to have occurred in the past 200 years, yet its causes and processes are still shrouded in ambiguity due to a lack of individual-level longitudinal data. A growing body of research has helped improve our understanding of the decline's causes by examining the development of socioeconomic differences in fertility using historical micro-data, but these have largely only considered rural areas where fertility was generally slower to decline. This article contributes to the literature by utilizing individual-level data from the Roteman Database for Stockholm, Sweden between 1878 and 1926 to examine the association of socioeconomic status and fertility and the adoption of stopping behaviour during the city's transition. Using piecewise constant hazard models and logistic regression, we find that a clear class pattern arises in which the elite were early practitioners of fertility control, followed by the working classes. As the transition unfolded, socioeconomic differences in stopping behaviour disappeared and overall fertility differentials were also minimized, both of them being consistent with patterns observed in rural populations. The implications of these findings for major explanations of the decline are discussed in the concluding section.;2016;Ready to stop: socioeconomic status and the fertility transition in Stockholm, 1878–1926;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Muller, Nicholas Z.;This paper assembles heating fuel prices for the U.S. state of Vermont, from the colonial era to the present, in order to test whether energy fuel prices and energy service prices have diverged over this time period. Prior authors have reported evidence of a significant difference between long run energy fuel prices and energy service prices. However, this is the first analysis to pose this question beginning in the context of colonial America. In accord with earlier work focused in the U.K. the paper reports a significant divergence in fuel and service prices. In this setting real heating fuel prices increased over the 220year time period by a factor of between 15 and 20. In contrast, heating service prices increased by a factor of two. Expressed in labor units, heating service prices have fallen in Vermont by 25%, while fuel prices were essentially flat. Finally, over this two century time period in Vermont and the U.K., the rate of change in service prices expressed in labor units is remarkably similar: −1.1% and −0.9%, per annum, respectively.;2016;On the divergence between fuel and service prices: The importance of technological change and diffusion in an American frontier economy;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Murhem, Sofia;This article is an attempt to explain the decline in pawnbroking over the late nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century Europe, using detailed evidence from Karlskrona in Sweden, 1880–1930.

Instead, there is no evidence for an effect of changes in regulation, the availability of other sources of credit, or the expansion of the welfare system.;2016;Credit for the poor: the decline of pawnbroking 1880–1930;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Nafziger, Steven;Communal property rights have long symbolized the apparent backwardness of rural Russian society in the late nineteenth century. Drawing on newly compiled data and qualitative sources, this article summarizes the institutions and practices of rural property rights in late Imperial Russia and shows that there was substantially more heterogeneity in what constituted peasant property rights than is commonly assumed. Archival and documentary accounts suggest that the emblematic practice of repartitioning communal land occurred relatively infrequently and, when undertaken, was generally managed in low-cost ways. Econometric evidence from Moscow province implies that repartitions were driven more by concerns over the distribution of associated tax burdens than the desire to reallocate productive assets. Along with an analysis of cross-sectional data on property rights and grain yields from European Russia, these findings suggest a weaker causal link between communal land practices and agricultural productivity than is typically asserted.;2016;Communal property rights and land redistributions in Late Tsarist Russia;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Nicolini, Esteban A.; Ramos Palencia, Fernando";"Research on economic inequality in early modern Europe is complicated by the lack of appropriate data for reconstructing income or wealth distributions. This article presents a study of income inequality in mid-eighteenth-century Old Castile (Spain) using the Ensenada Cadastre, a census conducted between 1749 and 1759. The article describes the information provided by this census and then discusses its advantages and disadvantages for reconstructing income profiles and calculating income inequality. This is followed by analysis of a dataset derived from the Cadastre that consists of more than 4,000 observations from Palencia (a province in northern Spain) and contains information on sources of household income, each household head's main occupation, residence location, and other household characteristics. Demographic data from this census is used to weight observations in the sample and thereby minimize selection bias. Findings show that inequality in eighteenth-century Spain was probably substantial despite its relative backwardness; that the relationship between inequality and per capita income was not clear-cut and was probably influenced by measurement of the higher incomes; and that although income inequality was largely driven by uneven land distribution, labour income also contributed to overall inequality?especially in urban centres.";2016;Decomposing income inequality in a backward pre-industrial economy: Old Castile (Spain) in the middle of the eighteenth century;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Obikili, Nonso;This article examines the possibility that the trans-Atlantic slave trade influenced the political institutions of villages and towns in precolonial Africa. Using anthropological data, it shows that villages and towns of ethnic groups with higher slave exports were more politically fragmented during the precolonial era. Instrumental variables are used to show that the relationship is causal. It is argued that this fragmentation is important for relative economic development because it still influences political institutions today. This argument is supported by the use of more contemporary data to show that in contemporary Nigeria and Tanzania, areas with higher levels of precolonial political fragmentation have a higher incidence of bribery.;2016;The trans-Atlantic slave trade and local political fragmentation in Africa;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Ojala, Jari; Pehkonen, Jaakko; ELORANTA, JARI";The study examines the evolution of skill premium and share at industry level in shipping during the age of sail. We argue that the period from the 1750s to the 1910s represented deskilling for the seamen working in sailing ships. The growth of international trade and shipping during the first era of globalization increased the overall demand for sailors but decreased the relative demand for skilled labor in favor of less skilled ones. This deskilling was associated with a decline in wage inequality, as the premium for high skilled seamen fell relative to mean wages in the shipping industry. The decline in skill premium may have facilitated the growth of trade and shipping, as the relative costs of transport declined. This in turn might have hastened the first era of globalization.;2016;Deskilling and decline in skill premium during the age of sail: Swedish and Finnish seamen, 1751–1913;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Palma, Nuno;What was the contribution of intercontinental trade to the development of the European early modern economies? Previous attempts to answer this question have focused on static measures of the weight of trade in the aggregate economy at a given point in time, or on the comparison of the income of specific imperial nations just before and after the loss of their overseas empire. These static accounting approaches are inappropriate if dynamic and spillover effects are at work, as seems likely. In this paper, I use a panel dataset of 10 countries in a dynamic model that allows for spillover effects, multiple channels of causality, persistence, and country-specific fixed effects. Using this dynamic model, simulations suggest that in the counterfactual absence of intercontinental trade, rates of early modern economic growth and urbanization would have been moderately to substantially lower. For the four main long-distance traders, by 1800, the real wage was, depending on the country, 6.1–22.7 % higher, and urbanization was 4.0–11.7 percentage points higher, than they would have otherwise been. For some countries, the effect was quite pronounced: in The Netherlands between 1600 and 1750, for instance, intercontinental trade was responsible for most of the observed increase in real wages and for a large share of the observed increase in urbanization. At the same time, countries which did not engage in long-distance trade would have had real wage increases in the order of 5.4–17.8 % and urbanization increases of 2.2–3.2 percentage points, should they have done so at the same level as the four main traders. Intercontinental trade appears to have played an important role for all nations that engaged in it, with the exception of France. These conclusions stand in contrast to the earlier literature that uses a partial equilibrium and static accounting approach.;2016;Sailing away from Malthus: intercontinental trade and European economic growth, 1500–1800;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Representatives' behavior using a panel dataset and instrumental
variables. Communities receiving more routes spread their votes to more parties;
there is no evidence it changed turnout. RFD shifted positions taken by
Representatives in line with rural constituents, including increased support for
pro-temperance and anti-immigration policies. These results appear only in
counties with newspapers, supporting the hypothesis that information flows play
a crucial role in the political process. “As the whole world has been drawn closer together by the

"Pittaluga, Giovanni B.; Seghezza, Elena";In the period of the classic gold standard, most peripheral countries were frequently affected by so-called sudden stops as well as by financial and currency crises. Yet pre-War Japan was an outlier. Though its level of external debt was not sustainable, Japan issued many government foreign loans to cover its current account deficits, was never affected by currency crises, and was never forced to suspend convertibility. We argue that, from the late nineteenth century until just before World War I, Japan and Britain engaged in a politico-economic exchange: Japan offered to protect Britain's economic and political interests in the Far East provided that Britain gave the rising Asian power access to financial markets—namely, in the City of London.;2016;How Japan remained on the Gold Standard despite unsustainable external debt;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Pleijt, Alexandra M. de; van Zanden, Jan Luiten";We test various hypotheses about the causes of the Little Divergence, using new data and focusing on trends in GDP per capita and urbanization. We find evidence that confirms the hypothesis that human capital formation was the driver of growth, and that institutional changes (in particular the rise of active Parliaments) were closely related to economic growth. We also test for the role of religion (the spread of Protestantism): this has affected human capital formation, but does not in itself have an impact on growth.;2016;Accounting for the “Little Divergence”: What drove economic growth in pre-industrial Europe, 1300–1800?;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

I find that all banks suffered tremendous deposit withdrawals; however banks that failed earlier in the 1930s had invested more in mortgages in the 1920s. The main problem with mortgages was their lack of liquidity, not their quality. Banks heavily engaged in mortgages did not have enough liquid assets to face the withdrawals, and failed.

Prados De La Escosura, Leandro;This article presents historical indices for the main dimensions of economic freedom and an aggregate index for the developed countries of today, specifically pre-1994 OECD members. Economic liberty expanded over the last century-and-a-half, reaching more than two-thirds of its possible maximum. However, its evolution has been far from linear. After a substantial improvement from the mid-nineteenth century, the First World War brought a major setback. The postwar recovery up to 1929 was followed by a dramatic decline in the 1930s. Significant progress took place during the 1950s but fell short of the pre-First World War peak. After a period of stagnation, steady expansion since the early 1980s has resulted in the highest levels of economic liberty of the last two centuries. Each of the main dimensions of economic freedom exhibited a distinctive trend and its contribution to the aggregate index varied over time. Overall, improved property rights provided the main contribution to the long-run advancement of economic liberty.;2016;Economic freedom in the long run: evidence from OECD countries (1850–2007);The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Importantly, their method of identifying traders differs from that of Jonathan Pritchett and Herman Freudenberger ().

"Pritchett, Jonathan B.; Hayes, Jessica";Although plantation records indicate that many slaves in the southern USA were artisans and craftsmen, relatively few slaves were recorded as such on the New Orleans sales invoices. Fogel (Without consent or contract: the rise and fall of American slavery. W. W. Norton & Company, New York, 1989, p. 57, 162) assumes that the slaves without recorded occupations were unskilled workers, concluding that skilled slaves were “less than half as likely to have been sold as were ordinary field hands.” Using data from New Orleans newspapers, we find that most sales advertisements include information about the slave’s occupation. A comparison of the advertisement with the corresponding sales invoice shows that the slave’s occupation was often omitted from the invoice. Because the slave’s market price should reflect all relevant information available at the time of sale, the informational value of the slave’s advertised occupation can be estimated using regression analysis. We find that the advertised occupation affected the slave’s market price, which suggests that newspaper advertisements were informative and not simply “cheap talk.”;2016;The occupations of slaves sold in New Orleans: Missing values, cheap talk, or informative advertising?;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Read, Charles;The decision in 1847 to cut Treasury spending on public relief efforts during the Irish famine is generally attributed by economic historians to the pervasive influence of ?laissez-faire? ideas on the Whig government of Lord John Russell. This article draws on the papers of political leaders and contemporary financial information to argue that economic reasons were the trigger for the change in policy. Robert Peel and Charles Wood's macroeconomic policies of the 1840s, including the gold standard, the Bank Charter Act, and corn law repeal, left the Whigs unable to borrow to finance relief efforts in Ireland without panicking markets. The scaling back of public assistance programmes that resulted from this?and which increased mortality at the height of the Irish famine?was the unintended result of Peel and Wood's economic policies, in the context of the Whig government's parliamentary weakness.;2016;Laissez-faire, the Irish famine, and British financial crisis;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Rota, Mauro;This article elucidates the complex and occasionally counter-intuitive effects of the twin phenomena of democratization and modernization on the path of military spending between 1880 and 1938 by analyzing the relationship between various traits of democracy and the state's fiscal capacity. The conclusion, in the spirit of Kant, is that it is political participation which is most effective in reducing military spending. Other elements of democracy play a distant secondary role. In addition, fiscal capacity, which often emerges and increases in tandem with democratization, is identified as one of the major determinants of defense outlays, although its impact decreased between the two World Wars.;2016;Military spending, fiscal capacity and the democracy puzzle;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Ryckbosch, Wouter;This article studies a collection of data on economic inequality in fifteen towns in the Southern and Northern Low Countries from the late Middle Ages until the end of the nineteenth century. By using a single and consistent source type and adopting a uniform methodology, it is possible to study levels of urban economic inequality across time and place comparatively. The results indicate a clear growth in economic inequality in the two centuries prior to the industrial revolution and the onset of sustained economic growth per capita. The results presented lend support to the “classical” explanation of inequality as the consequence of a changing functional distribution of income favoring capital over labor over the course of the early modern period. These findings provide an alternative resolution of the conundrum presented by “optimist” and “pessimists” interpretations of early modern economic development.;2016;Economic inequality and growth before the industrial revolution: the case of the Low Countries (fourteenth to nineteenth centuries);European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Saaritsa, Sakari; Kaihovaara, Antti";Apart from the commonly emphasized historical or cultural explanations, was there an economics behind the early, extensive schooling of girls in Europe’s Nordic periphery? This article analyses factors behind the emerging female majority in secondary schooling in early twentieth century Finland through resource allocation within households. We argue that a significant part of the female educational advantage can be explained with a classic unitary Beckerian schooling investment model. We apply an Engel specification widely used in development economics to a household budget dataset from the 1920s to estimate the effect of the age and gender of children on schooling investment across social groups. We find a pro-girl bias among households of low socio-economic status, explained primarily by the sizable penalty to boys caused by opportunity costs and expected returns. Worker boys could generate significant income from an early age, making their education initially expensive for cash-constrained families. Contrary to previous claims, the dropout rates of boys were also higher than those of girls. Together with a propensity to leave home earlier, this lowered the expected net returns to schooling. Meanwhile, the expansion of modern services created attractive job opportunities for secondary educated girls. We find no evidence of intrahousehold bargaining. The findings resemble certain cases in development economics and the economic history of advanced countries including the USA. Rather than matching with patterns of anti-girl discrimination in many developing countries, our results highlight the prehistory of the currently emerging pattern of female educational advantage—and male disadvantage—in OECD countries.;2016;Good for girls or bad for boys?

Sabaté, Oriol;Warfare and military competition have been defined as important driving forces for the expansion of fiscal capacity during late-modern times. However, the empirical evidence remains inconclusive, and we still lack a historical narrative that explains how warfare has affected the evolution of late-modern fiscal systems. This article aims to fill this gap by analysing the effects of warfare on fiscal development in the light of the so-called Revolutions in Military Affairs that took place in Western countries since the mid-nineteenth century to the present. The results suggest that the interplay between warfare and fiscal expansion has followed an inverted “U-shape” pattern, in which changes in military tactics and technology have pushed public revenues up until the destructive power has passed the nuclear threshold level. Additionally, the results pose that politics is relevant to complete this war-led narrative.;2016;Does military pressure boost fiscal capacity?

"Saito, Osamu; Takashima, Masanori";"This paper proposes a new methodology of estimating non-primary sector output shares in early modern growth. By using data from proto-industrial Japan, the paper demonstrates, first, that not just the rate of urbanisation but population density would also work as another predictor of the secondary- and tertiary-sectoral shares when growth was rural-centred; and second, that regional panel data should be constructed from earliest possible sets of modern data to estimate the coefficients of these two variables on the sectoral shares. In order to apply the coefficients derived from modern data for the calculation of pre-modern estimates, regional panel data are far superior to simple time-series statistics. The paper presents new estimates of sectoral shares and the corresponding set of per capita gross domestic product thus computed for Japan 1600–1846, with a few comments on the prior estimates by Angus Maddison.";2016;Estimating the shares of secondary- and tertiary-sector outputs in the age of early modern growth: the case of Japan, 1600–1874;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Saleh, Mohamed;"Public mass modern education was a major pillar of state-led development in the post-Colonial period. I examine the impact of Egypt's transformation in 1951–1953 of traditional elementary schools (kuttabs) into modern primary schools on the Christian-Muslim educational and occupational differentials, which were in favor of Christians. The reform granted kuttabs' graduates (where Muslim students were over-represented) access to higher stages of education that were previously confined to primary schools' graduates. Exploiting the variation in exposure to the reform across cohorts and districts of birth among males in 1986, I find that the reform benefited Muslims but not Christians.
What Europe is suffering from is the result of generalizing education among all levels of society… they have no chance of avoiding what happened [Europe's 1848 revolutions].

Schofield, Roger;In an earlier study of the plague in Colyton, Devon, the household distribution of deaths was studied to see whether this provided a method of identifying the causative disease. In this article, a known epidemic of plague in the Swedish parish of Bräkne-Hoby was studied as a means of testing out the generality of the household distribution of deaths. It was discovered that, in this case, the very heavy mortality was due to two radically different means of spreading the disease, initially the classic bubonic one through the rat flea, and latterly, and somewhat surprisingly, the pneumonic one, through the infection of the inhabitants by their own friends and neighbours.;2016;The last visitation of the plague in Sweden: the case of Bräkne-Hoby in 1710–11;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The indirect, but quantitatively more important, effect was to eliminate the need for a stop at or near the Cape.

"Spencer, Christopher; Temple, Paul";This article considers the model of voluntary, consensus based standardization as developed through the British Standards Institution (BSI) and its contribution to learning and productivity growth. It discusses the significant role played by professional engineers in the model's introduction, its extension at home, and its imitation overseas. It is argued that by 1931 the BSI catalogue of standards represented a considerable stock of codified knowledge whose growth reflected underlying aggregate technological opportunities, assisting in their transformation into technological advance. To help validate this claim, a measure of the size of the BSI catalogue of standards is incorporated into an econometric model of aggregate productivity growth in Britain. Findings show that the growth of the standards catalogue is associated with a substantial proportion of labour productivity growth over the period 1931?2009. Estimates relating to the short-run dynamics involved are consistent with the idea that there are causal linkages running from standards to growth. When interpreting these findings, it is argued that the overall weight of historical evidence points to standardization?coordinated through the BSI?as providing an important path of learning for the British economy over the period considered.;2016;Standards, learning, and growth in Britain, 1901–2009;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Standaert, Samuel; Ronsse, Stijn; Vandermarliere, Benjamin";In times of ongoing globalization, the notion of geographic neutrality expects the impact of distance on trade to become ever more irrelevant. However, over the last three decades a wide range of studies has found an increase in the importance of distance during the second half of the twentieth century. This paper tries to reframe this discussion by characterizing the effect of distance over a broader historical point of view. To make maximal use of the available data, we use a state-space model to construct a bilateral index of historical trade integration. Our index doubles to quadruples yearly data availability before 1950, allowing us to expand the period of analysis to 1880–2011. This implies that the importance of distance as a determinant of the changing trade pattern can be analyzed for both globalization waves. In line with O’Rourke (Politics and trade: lessons from past globalisations. Technical Report, Bruegel, 2009) and Jacks et al. (J Int Econ 83(2):185–201, 2011), we find that the first wave was marked by a strong, continuing decrease in the effect of distance. Initially, the second globalization wave started out similarly, but from the 1960s onward the importance of distance starts increasing. Nevertheless, this change is dwarfed by the strong decrease preceding it.;2016;Historical trade integration: globalization and the distance puzzle in the long twentieth century;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Stasavage, David;Many people believe that the early development of sovereign debt depended on institutions, but there are two very different ways of presenting this narrative and two very different conclusions one might draw for sovereign debt today. According to the first, this was an impartial story involving executive constraints, shared governance, increased monitoring, and increased transparency — in other words things that sound unambiguously good. According to the second narrative this was a story of distributive politics. States had the best access to credit when institutions gave government creditors privileged access to decision making while restricting the influence of those who paid the taxes to reimburse debts. This was a situation where institutions fostered commitment, but at a cost, and sometimes they may not even have been welfare enhancing. In this paper I present evidence from seven centuries of European history, and I suggest that available data support the distributive politics interpretation. I then draw implications for how we think about the politics of sovereign debt today.;2016;What we can learn from the early history of sovereign debt;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Stevens, Matthew Frank;Evidence of debts owed to Londoners, and contested before the royal Court of Common Pleas, allows an examination of the role of London creditors in the English depression of the fifteenth century and a reassessment of its causes. In this article, four main issues are examined. What is the nature of the Court of Common Pleas evidence (section I)? What were the three main forms of credit offered by Londoners?unsecured cash loans, sales of goods on credit, and written instruments called bonds (section II)? What is yielded by decadal analysis of Londoners? extension of credit in the fifteenth century?making direct comparisons with Nightingale's published Statute Merchant and Staple data (section III)? What defines, in modern economic terms, the claim of so-called ?monetarist? historians that credit was actively withdrawn during the depression, and how is this verified by the actions of London creditors (section IV)? It is concluded that the records of the Court of Common Pleas provide the detailed evidence monetarist historians have previously lacked both to prove that Londoners actively withdrew credit during the fifteenth century and to demonstrate that they employed pure equilibrium credit rationing in order to do so.;2016;London creditors and the fifteenth-century depression;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Svensson, Roger;Scholars in the fields of archaeology and numismatics have long been familiar with the phenomenon of periodic recoinage (renovatio monetae), which dominated monetary taxation in medieval Europe for almost 200 years. However, this form of monetary taxation is seldom, if ever, discussed in the literature of economics or economic history. No economic theory has ever been proposed to explain periodic recoinage. The present study aims to make up for this absence. It examines the qualities that typically differentiate regions with periodic recoinage from those with other monetary systems and analyses how periodic recoinage was monitored and enforced. The principal example of frequently renewed coins is uni-faced bracteates, which were often subject to annual or even biannual recoinages. Although bracteates were not the cause of periodic recoinage, their features facilitated frequent renewals. The study discusses the economic consequences of periodic recoinage and links the breakdown of this monetary system with the end of bracteates? role as the principal coin in the fourteenth century.;2016;Periodic recoinage as a monetary tax: conditions for the rise and fall of the bracteate economy;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

However, the pace of that recovery between that date and the Second World War was extremely uneven with some dramatic starts and stops. Between March and July 1933, manufacturing production rose 78%, production of durable goods was up 199%, total industrial production rose 57%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 71%. Then the economy contracted sharply again beginning in August 1933–the July 1933 level of industrial production was not reached again until August 1935. This paper addresses two questions.

"Timmer, Marcel P.; Veenstra, Joost; Woltjer, Pieter J.";Labor productivity in German manufacturing lagged persistently behind the United States in the early twentieth century. Traditionally, this is attributed to dichotomous technology paths across the Atlantic. However, various industry case studies suggest rapid diffusion of U.S. technologies in Germany. We develop a novel decomposition framework based on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to reconcile these findings. We conclude that by 1936 inefficient assimilation of modern production techniques—and not the use of different techniques—accounted for most of the U.S./German labor-productivity gap.

To Figueras, Lluís;Between 1230 and 1315 a large amount of Flemish and northern French cloth reached the market of Vic, a medium-sized Catalan town to the north of Barcelona. Descriptions of cloth from a sample of over 1,000 wedding trousseaus reveal that common people were quite familiar with a wide selection of fabrics from manufacturing centres such as Bruges, Saint-Omer, Arras, and Châlons, and by the end of the thirteenth century Saint-Denis, Paris, Ypres, and Narbonne. Northern cloth had travelled over 1,000?kilometres before it reached the market stalls of Vic, reflecting the efficiency of commercial networks in bringing commodities across Europe at a reasonable transportation cost. Marriage contracts from this period specify the identity of the most frequent purchasers of these fabrics, and the identity of the women that would wear them, tailored as capes or tunics. Northern cloth was purchased by all social groups, not just the wealthy elite: even peasant households used such fabrics for their daughters' dresses. All in all, wedding trousseaus provide exceptional evidence of how commercialized both the urban and rural populations had become by the end of the thirteenth century in a society eager to buy imported commodities.;2016;Wedding trousseaus and cloth consumption in Catalonia around 1300;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"van Bavel, Bas; Rijpma, Auke";Poor relief in the pre-industrial period is a much-investigated topic, but we still lack an idea of its quantitative importance and development, especially in a comparative perspective. This article estimates the magnitude of the various kinds of formalized relief for three present-day countries (Italy, England, and the Netherlands) in the very long run (1400?1850). The results show that in this period a substantial share of GDP, up to 3 per cent, could be spent on formal relief, offering subsistence to up to 8?9 per cent of the population, with a gradual rise over time and the highest figures being reached in the Netherlands in the eighteenth century. The three cases show a steep decline around 1800, a pattern found more generally in Europe. Next, these results are placed in a broader geographical perspective. This highlights the sharp differences within countries?which could be even larger than those between countries?and the high levels reached in the regions bordering the southern shores of the North Sea. In the last section, the results are used to discuss the possible causes underlying these long-run patterns and geographical differences, including urbanization, wealth, religion, and social-organizational features.;2016;How important were formalized charity and social spending before the rise of the welfare state?

Vickers, Chris;In a criminal sentencing system based on optimal deterrence, groups will receive different average sentences based on disparities in conviction probabilities, with longer prison sentences balancing more frequent acquittals. A taste-based model makes no such prediction. I compare these models using trial records from England and Wales in 1870, 1883, and 1910, years with extensive jury trials and broad latitude in sentencing for judges. In the earlier years, higher status defendants accused of property crimes receive substantially longer sentences, with no such difference for violent crimes. In contrast, higher status defendants are less likely to be convicted at trial, both when accused of property crimes and of violent crimes. In a Heckman selection empirical model, selection into sentencing has a large effect on the magnitude of these sentencing patterns. For property crimes, there is negative selection on unobservable traits, possibly explained by using imperfect proxies for social class. I conclude that an optimal sentencing and deterrence model is more supported for property crimes than for violent ones, with judges balancing disparate rates of conviction from juries.;2016;Socioeconomic status and judicial disparities in England and Wales, 1870–1910;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

WILLIAMS, SAMANTHA;This article examines the dynamics of the maintenance of illegitimate children in London during the protracted ?crisis? of the old poor law between the 1790s and the 1830s. This was a period of rapidly rising illegitimacy as well as national, and metropolitan, poor law expenditure. The affiliation system offered parish officials a parallel system by which poor rates could be deflated, but analysis of the 1834 Town Queries reveals that metropolitan parishes could be particularly poor at recovering the costs of chargeable bastards from putative fathers. The article interrogates in detail the workings of the affiliation system in Southwark and Lambeth in terms of the proportion of fathers (and mothers) who paid maintenance for their children, either in lump sums or in weekly allowances, plus the associated costs of childbirth and legal fees, the range of weekly sums, which could be higher than previously thought, and the duration for which they were paid, which could be surprisingly long.

Winton, Patrik;This article examines the commitment mechanisms which guided sovereign borrowing during the Napoleonic Wars by analyzing Sweden's default on its external debt in 1812. The default was driven by internal political bargaining concerning the division of resources, and the availability of subsidies provided by the major European powers. Thus, the Swedish government and the Diet made strategic choices when deciding which debts to pay. The reputational mechanisms and the creditors’ attempts to force the Swedish state to honor its commitments did not work when the government had access to foreign subsidies.;2016;The political economy of strategic default: Sweden and the international capital markets, 1810–1830;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Prices for many commodities in the Dutch-Asiatic trade converged already in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as a result of the growth of trade and competition among traders and companies. The extent of convergence, however, was determined, in part, by the ability of the VOC to control commodity markets.;2016;Globalization in the Early Modern Era: New Evidence from the Dutch-Asiatic Trade, c. 1600–1800;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

ALFANI, GUIDO;This article provides an overview of long-term changes in the relative conditions of the rich in preindustrial Europe. It covers four pre-unification Italian states (Sabaudian State, Florentine State, Kingdom of Naples and Republic of Venice) as well as other areas of Europe (Low Countries, Catalonia) during the period 1300–1800. Three different kinds of indicators are measured systematically and combined in the analysis: headcount indexes, the share of the top rich, and richness indexes. Taken together, they suggest that overall, during the entirety of the early modern period the rich tended to become both more prevalent and more distanced from the other strata of society. The only period during which the opposite process took place was the late Middle Ages, following the Black Death epidemic of the mid-fourteenth century. In the period from ca. 1500 to 1800, the prevalence of the rich doubled. In the Sabaudian State, the Florentine State and the Kingdom of Naples, for which reconstructions of regional wealth distributions exist, in about the same period the share of the top 10 % grew from 45–55 to 70–80 %—reaching almost exactly the same level which has recently been suggested as the European average at 1810. Consequently, the time series presented here might be used to add about five centuries of wealth inequality trends to current debates on very long-term changes in the relative position of the rich.;2017;The rich in historical perspective: evidence for preindustrial Europe (ca. 1300–1800);Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Regional studies of this kind are rare, and this is only the second-ever attempt at covering such a long period. Consistent with recent research conducted on other European areas, during the early modern period we find clear indications of a tendency for economic inequality to grow continually, a finding that for Tuscany cannot be explained as the consequence of economic growth. Furthermore, the exceptionally old sources we use allow us to demonstrate that a phase of declining inequality, lasting about one century, was triggered by the Black Death from 1348 to 1349.

"ALFANI, GUIDO; Murphy, Tommy E.";This article provides an overview of recent literature on plagues and other lethal epidemics, covering the period from late Antiquity to ca. 1800. We analyze the main environmental and institutional factors that shaped both the way in which a plague originated and spread and its overall demographic and socioeconomic consequences. We clarify how the same pathogen shows historically different epidemiological characteristics, and how apparently similar epidemics could have deeply different consequences. We discuss current debates about the socioeconomic consequences of the Black Death and other plagues. We conclude with historical lessons to understand modern “plagues.”;2017;Plague and Lethal Epidemics in the Pre-Industrial World;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
ALLEN, MARTIN;Between the eleventh century and mid-thirteenth century a Sterling Area evolved in the British Isles, with a common currency based upon the English silver penny and equivalents of it produced in Scotland and Ireland. This Sterling Area began to contract in the second half of the fourteenth century, when reductions in the bullion content of Scottish coins ended the equivalence of the English and Scottish currencies, and in the fifteenth century Ireland developed its own coinage. Estimates of the currency of the Sterling Area are provided, taking the chronology of its growth and contraction into account. Estimates of the sterling currency are not estimates of the currency of England, and they cannot be combined with data relating exclusively to England in economic modelling, without qualification. Per capita currency estimates and values of coin hoards and single coin finds are at a high level around 1400, falling in the second half of the fifteenth century, indicating that the European ?bullion famine? of the 1390s to c. 1415 had less effect on the currency than the second late medieval bullion crisis, from the 1430s to the 1460s.;2017;The first Sterling Area†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Amore, Mario Daniele;I empirically investigate the effect of social capital on family control in a comprehensive data set from Italy. Exploiting historically-driven variations in social capital provided by the experience of self-government during the Middle Ages, I find that when social capital is weak, family control and management of companies are more prevalent. These results provide novel evidence on the pervasive influence of culture on organizational structures.;2017;Social capital and family control;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Angeles, Luis;While China's invention of printing took place several centuries ahead of Europe's, it was in Europe where the more advanced printing technology of movable type took hold and where book production reached far higher levels. This article explores the extent to which China's complex logographic writing system explains these different outcomes. Using an economic analysis, I show how China's preference for block printing technology over movable type can be justified as the rational choice of commercial producers. In addition to this, model simulations also predict that movable type would be used in China under some specific circumstances which closely match the historical record. On the other hand, the use of block printing would not have led to larger printing costs in China, and as such should not be regarded as the reason behind China's modest level of book production when compared to Europe's.;2017;The great divergence and the economics of printing†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Armstrong, Alex; Lewis, Frank D.";As has been seen in other contexts, workers in similar occupations earned much higher wages in Canada than Europe during the 1920s. This observation and related aspects of immigration are addressed with a life-cycle model of the migration decision. The characteristics of immigrants from five European countries: Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, and Sweden, are explored in a way that sheds light not just on those population flows but on the process of immigration generally. We draw on passenger manifests from immigrant ships for information on the individual migrants. Simulations, based partly on the these manifests, reveal that the costs of migration, borrowing constraints, concern for status, and country-specific taste preferences account for key immigrant characteristics, and help explain the large wage differentials that persisted despite Canada’s relatively open immigration policy.;2017;Transatlantic wage gaps and the migration decision: Europe–Canada in the 1920s;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Arroyo Abad, Leticia; Astorga Junquera, Pablo";This paper traces between-group earnings inequality for six Latin American countries over two centuries based on wage and income series compiled from a large array of primary and secondary sources. We find that inequality varied substantially by country and by period, questioning the notion that colonial legacies largely dominated the evolution of inequality. There is a broader inequality trajectory over the long run in the form of an “m” pattern with peaks around 1880 and the 1990s and a trough around 1920/1930s. Export-led growth does not necessarily imply a rise in inequality, while the import-substitution industrialisation efforts did not translate into a more egalitarian distribution of income. More notably, Latin America’s experience does not exhibit the great inequality levelling as seen in the North Atlantic economies from the 1930s to the 1970s.;2017;Latin American earnings inequality in the long run;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Aston, Jennifer; Di MARTINO, PAOLO";This article analyses female entrepreneurship in late Victorian and Edwardian England. Traditional views on female entrepreneurship in nineteenth- and twentieth-century England point towards a decline in the number and relevance of women as business owners in comparison to the eighteenth century, and their retreat into a ?separate sphere? away from the world of trade and production. Recent studies, however, have deeply challenged this view, suggesting that women still played an important role as entrepreneurs during industrialization and beyond. Nevertheless, a number of questions remain unanswered with regard to the features of female entrepreneurship during these phases of British history, and issues such as scale of operation, attitude to risk, credit structure, and managerial styles are still widely debated. Using original sources, this article provides a novel view on these issues, analysing female entrepreneurship from the perspective of bankruptcy. Analysing statistics on women's bankruptcy derived from Board of Trade reports, as well as a sample of archival cases, this article argues that overall female business owners traded in ways similar to their male counterparts in terms of business size, risk-taking, and, eventually, success.;2017;Risk, success, and failure: female entrepreneurship in late Victorian and Edwardian England;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"ATKINSON, PAUL; FRANCIS, BRIAN; Gregory, Ian; PORTER, CATHERINE";The study of nineteenth-century infant mortality in Britain has neglected the rural dimension to a surprising degree. This article maps the change in infant mortality rate (IMR) between the 1850s and the 1900s at registration district (RD) level. Latent trajectory analysis, a longitudinal model-based clustering method, is used to identify the clusters into which rural RDs fell, based on their IMR trajectories. Relationships between IMR and population density, fertility, female tuberculosis mortality, female illiteracy, male agricultural wages, and distance from London are examined in a longitudinal study. The tuberculosis (maternal health), illiteracy (education), and distance variables had the most effect. IMR responded most strongly to improving health and education in the east, less in the central area, and least in the north and west. The eastern zone's higher-than-average mid-century infant mortality therefore declined faster than the national average. A central and southern zone had slightly lower IMR in mid-century but did not keep up with the rate of decline in the east. The peripheral north and west had the lowest mid-century rates but their decline was overtaken by the other zones. The interpretation of these findings and their relevance to the wider study of infant mortality are discussed.;2017;Patterns of infant mortality in rural England and Wales, 1850–1910†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Bell, Adrian R.; Brooks, Chris; Moore, Tony K.";A major gap in our understanding of the medieval economy concerns interest rates, especially relating to commercial credit. Although direct evidence about interest rates is scattered and anecdotal, there is much more surviving information about exchange rates. Since both contemporaries and historians have suggested that exchange and rechange transactions could be used to disguise the charging of interest in order to circumvent the usury prohibition, it should be possible to back out implied interest rates from exchange rates. The analysis presented in this article is based on a new dataset of medieval exchange rates collected from commercial correspondence in the archive of Francesco di Marco Datini of Prato, c. 1383?1411. It demonstrates that the time value of money was consistently incorporated into market exchange rates. Moreover, these implicit interest rates are broadly comparable to those received from other types of commercial loan and investment. Although on average profitable, the return on any individual exchange and rechange transaction did involve a degree of uncertainty that may have justified their non-usurious nature. However, there were also practical reasons why medieval merchants may have used foreign exchange transactions as a means of extending credit.;2017;Cambium non est mutuum: exchange and interest rates in medieval Europe;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Beltrán Tapia, Francisco J.; Gallego-Martínez, Domingo";This article shows that average (male-to-female) infant and child sex ratios were abnormally high in late 18th- and 19th-century Spain, thus pointing to some sort of unexplained excess female mortality early in life. This pattern, which is also shared by other countries in Southern Europe, disappeared at the turn of the 20th century. Rather than female infanticide or other type of extreme violence against girls, these results might be explained by gender discrimination in terms of an unequal allocation of food, care and/or workload within the household. In high-mortality environments, this type of discrimination easily resulted in higher female mortality rates.;2017;Where are the missing girls?

"Beltrán Tapia, Francisco J.; Miguel Salanova, Santiago de";Drawing on a large database from the register of inhabitants of Madrid, this article confirms that the literacy levels of internal migrants moving to the Spanish capital city in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century were higher than that of those who remained in their provinces of origin. This article also explores the different factors influencing the nature and intensity of the selection process. The empirical exercise stresses that the stock of previous migration was a fundamental factor in allowing less literate individuals to join the migration process as well. Interestingly, distance to Madrid hardly affected the profile of male migrants, but it was a strong influence on female migration, although its importance diminished over time. Lastly, the results presented here show that other internal destinations were attracting different types of migrants, often resulting in negative self-selection.;2017;Migrants’ self-selection in the early stages of modern economic growth, Spain (1880–1930);The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

A central task for economic historians is to explain why some countries forged ahead, while others fell behind, and how some initially backward countries managed to converge with the leading industrializers in the nineteenth century. While these divergent growth trajectories are typically attributed to country-level differences in terms of, for example, factor prices or institutions, the vast gaps in industrialization and incomes that opened up within nations are hard to reconcile with such explanations. Against that backdrop, my dissertation analyzes regional and urban growth patterns during Sweden’s remarkable economic transformation during the half century leading up to the Great War.
As forcefully argued by Sidney Pollard, it has always been known that an industrial revolution has to be associated with a revolution in transportation. Above all, the railroad epitomized the nineteenth-century transport revolution to contemporary observers and the uneven spread of the emerging European railroad networks were often expected to be able to “make or break” a region. However, it has remained challenging for economic historians to identify the impact of the railroads since they often connected already rapidly growing places. In two companion chapters, I exploit the rollout of the Swedish state railroad network to identify its contribution to industrialization and short- and long-term impacts on urban growth, respectively. Estimates reveal a sharp acceleration in the pace of industrialization in both cities and rural parishes that were “randomly” traversed by a railroad, while the shock of the first railroads shifted the spatial equilibrium of the urban economy that is still visible in the size distribution of cities some 150 years later.";2017;Engines of growth: essays in Swedish economic history;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Beuve, Jean; Brousseau, Eric; Sgard, Jérôme";"French mercantilism is generally associated with absolutist policy-making subject to capture by rent-seeking interests. This article investigates how the Bureau du Commerce, a small state agency in charge of commerce and the supply side, handed out rents and privileges to private entrepreneurs. We coded how the Bureau investigated and decided all 267 voluntary submissions received between 1724 and 1744. It is shown that the Bureau?s formal, rule-based decision-making process could actually differentiate between alternate policy aims and target them consistently over time, with more or less powerful sets of rents. From this, a hierarchy of revealed policy preferences is derived. First comes technical innovation and diffusion, then local economic development; import substitution is only in the third position, followed by consumers? welfare. Lastly, and in contrast to a long line of authors, it is shown that the production of luxury goods was not a significant or valued objective.";2017;Mercantilism and bureaucratic modernization in early eighteenth-century France;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

This set-up reflected an attempt to maximize information and expertise, but also allowed for the recognition of private rights and social interests. The final decisions of the Bureau (for or against each demand), and the qualitative arguments brought forward during the procedure, are robust predictors of eventual decisions. We see this result as an indication that impersonal, rational and informed decision-making could be obtained even within a patrimonialist, rent-seeking State.;2017;Why Are Modern Bureaucracies Special?

BLAKEMORE, RICHARD J.;Historians have generally argued that between the medieval period and the eighteenth century seafarers transformed from collaborative adventurers with a share in their vessel to the first international wage-earning proletariat. This interpretation has drawn upon relatively limited statistical analysis of mariners? wages, and underestimates the variety of seafarers? remuneration and economic activities besides wages themselves. This article undertakes a more sustained analysis of seventeenth-century wage data drawn from the papers of the English High Court of Admiralty, and uses the same evidence to examine other forms of income, both customary payments as part of shipping, and small-scale trade. Seafarers of all ranks carried their own commodities on all shipping routes, offering an opportunity to increase their income considerably. This evidence confirms that the maritime labour market was hierarchical, and that very often seafarers were poor labourers facing economic insecurity of many kinds. However, it refines the previous interpretation by emphasizing the presence of skilled workers even among the lower levels of this labour market, and by introducing a new dimension to mariners? economic agency: they were not simply wage-workers, but also independent participants in a venture economy.;2017;Pieces of eight, pieces of eight: seamen's earnings and the venture economy of early modern seafaring†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Bleakley, Hoyt; Hong, Sok Chul";An important unknown in understanding the impact of climate change is the scope of adaptation, which requires observations on historical time scales. We consider how weather across U.S. history (1860–2000) has affected various measures of productivity. Using cross-sectional and panel methods, we document significant responses of agricultural and individual productivity to weather. We find strong effects of hotter and wetter weather early in U.S. history, but these effects have generally been attenuated in recent decades. The results suggest that estimates from a given period may be of limited use in forecasting the longer-term impacts of climate change.;2017;Adapting to the Weather: Lessons from U.S. History;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Blum, Matthias; Colvin, Christopher L.; McAtackney, Laura; McLaughlin, Eoin";"Geary and Stark find that Ireland's post-Famine per capita GDP converged with British levels, and that this convergence was largely due to total factor productivity growth rather than mass emigration. In this article, new long-run measurements of human capital accumulation in Ireland are devised in order to facilitate a better assessment of sources of this productivity growth, including the relative contribution of men and women. This is done by exploiting the frequency at which age data heap at round ages, widely interpreted as an indicator of a population's basic numeracy skills. Because Földvári, van Leeuwen, and van Leeuwen-Li find that gender-specific trends in this measure derived from census returns are biased by who is reporting and recording the age information, any computed numeracy trends are corrected using data from prison and workhouse registers, sources in which women ostensibly self-reported their age. The findings show that rural Irish women born early in the nineteenth century had substantially lower levels of human capital than uncorrected census data would otherwise suggest. These results are large in magnitude and thus economically significant. The speed at which women converged is consistent with Geary and Stark's interpretation of Irish economic history; Ireland probably graduated to Europe's club of advanced economies thanks in part to rapid advances in female human capital.";2017;Women of an uncertain age: quantifying human capital accumulation in rural Ireland in the nineteenth century†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Bodenhorn, Howard; Guinnane, Timothy W.; Mroz, Thomas A.";Understanding long-term changes in human well-being is central to understanding the consequences of economic development. An extensive anthropometric literature purports to show that heights in the United States declined between the 1830s and the 1890s, which is when the U.S. economy modernized. Most anthropometric research contends that declining heights reflect the negative health consequences of industrialization and urbanization. This interpretation, however, relies on sources subject to selection bias. Our meta-analysis shows that the declining height during industrialization emerges primarily in selected samples. We also develop a parsimonious diagnostic test that reveals, but does not correct for, selection bias in height samples. When applied to four representative height samples, the diagnostic provides compelling evidence of selection.;2017;Sample-Selection Biases and the Industrialization Puzzle;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Bohman, Magnus;Was there an agro-ecological crisis in Europe which preceded and contributed to pushing forward the agricultural revolution? This article presents a new theoretical and empirical approach to this controversial perspective on agricultural transformation and relates to an ongoing debate on conditions of growth in pre-industrial societies. The results demonstrate that there were indeed indicators of a crisis, which grew stronger during the eighteenth century and culminated in the early nineteenth century. The crisis was, however, not general, but was rather restricted to areas that stand out due to poor natural conditions for agriculture. In other words, the crisis was conditional. Furthermore, the findings show that the crisis could push forward changes that were important for enabling agricultural transformation and growth. However, both the emergence and reversal of the crisis were connected to new opportunities opened up by market development. Enough differences were found between different types of regions to suggest that there were many development paths within the agricultural transformation process, and that they were not necessarily linear.;2017;Conditional crisis?

We show that the protocol is evolutionarily stable and designed to converge to the efficient price, which had important implications to the political economy of Florence and the stability of its monetary system. We also show that the predicted dynamics of convergence are consistent with surviving exchange rates from 1389 to 1432, thereby linking the empirical properties of the historical data to the institutional features of the guild that generated them.;2017;Domestic exchange rate determination in Renaissance Florence;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Bradbury, John Charles;During the early days of professional baseball, the dominant major leagues imposed a “reserve clause” designed to limit player wages by restricting competition for labor. Entry into the market by rival leagues challenged the incumbent monopsony cartel's ability to restrict compensation. Using a sample of player salaries from the first 40 years of the reserve clause (1880–1919), this study examines the impact of inter-league competition on player wages. This study finds a positive salary effect associated with rival league entry that is consistent with monopsony wage suppression, but the effect is stronger during the 20th century than the 19th century. Changes in levels of market saturation and minor-league competition may explain differences in the effects between the two eras.;2017;Monopsony and competition: The impact of rival leagues on player salaries during the early days of baseball;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
BUCCIFERRO, JUSTIN R.;"Race is a fundamental aspect of historical inequality and institutions, yet it is at times overlooked within the literature on comparative development in the Americas. This article investigates the nature of staple production in Brazil and attendant changes in the racial composition of 20 modern states from its discovery by the Portuguese to the present. The Indigenous population was surpassed by that of African descent in the north-east, south-east, and north, respectively, during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries; not until decades after the abolition of slavery did people of European heritage come to constitute a majority. These transitions were guided by the relative productivity, natural increase, and price of Native and African slaves, contingent on the extent of natural resource wealth (mineral deposits or land suitable for growing cash crops) and supply of free labour. In those areas where slavery was most profitable, a 1 per cent increase in the relative cost of Native labour raised the proportion of people of African ancestry by up to 2 per cent, depending on the measures of slave prices and racial classifications considered. This relationship is robust to changes in output prices or the populace of European descent, and alternative scenarios of aboriginal population decline.";2017;The economic geography of race in the New World: Brazil, 1500–2000†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

These results place a limit on the view that the pre-First World War period was the first era of globalization in terms of capital markets. However, there was considerable integration between New York and those listings on London that operated internationally.

The contact with the Atlantic slave trade increased regional divergence, as the coast of Senegambia developed more quickly than inner areas.

Caracausi, Andrea;This article analyses the relationship between guilds and information asymmetries using a large database of quality disputes from early modern Italy. It finds that a high-quality urban textile industry was able to solve externalities using a range of ex ante and ex post monitoring mechanisms based on private market relationships and fair sanctions which effectively reduced adverse selection and information asymmetries. Instead, when guilds did use their quality regulations, the effect of the guild on information asymmetries and the industry as a whole was generally negative, by providing mechanisms that could be manipulated by entrenched interest groups for rent-seeking purposes.;2017;Information asymmetries and craft guilds in pre-modern markets: evidence from Italian proto-industry;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Carbonell-Esteller, Montserrat; MARFANY, JULIE";Poor relief has received less attention from historians of southern Europe compared with northern Europe. This article seeks to challenge the frequent assumption that the strength of family ties in southern Europe mitigated the need for welfare provision. It provides new data for men and boys entering the Barcelona workhouse in the period 1780?1803, and compares these with data from an earlier study of women and girls who entered the same institution over the period 1762?1805. We establish the characteristics of those who sought relief in terms of age, place of origin, marital status, and occupation. We use the information on reasons for entry and exit to ascertain family circumstances. We show that there were significant differences between males and females in terms of why they entered and left, and length of stay, particularly among the elderly. The bulk of the population of the workhouse, however, was comprised of children and adolescents. For this group, entry into the workhouse represented not just a temporary solution to life cycle poverty and periodic unemployment, but also a longer-term strategy aimed at smoothing entry into the labour market.;2017;Gender, life cycle, and family ‘strategies’ among the poor: the Barcelona workhouse, 1762–1805;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Carmona, Juan; Lampe, Markus; Rosés, Joan Ramón";During the decades prior to the Civil War, Spain experienced a rapid process of urbanization, which was accompanied by the demographic transition and sizeable rural?urban migrations. This article investigates how urban housing markets reacted to these far-reaching changes, which increased demand for dwellings. To this end, this study employs a new hedonic index of real housing prices and constructs a cross-regional panel dataset of rents and housing price fundamentals. This new evidence indicates that rents were not a significant financial burden on low-income families and, hence, housing was affordable for the working classes. The article also shows that families? access to new homes was facilitated by a sizeable growth in the housing supply. Substantial investments in urban infrastructure and the institutional framework enabled the construction of new homes at affordable prices. Our results suggest that housing problems were not as pervasive during the urban transition as the literature often seems to claim.;2017;Housing affordability during the urban transition in Spain;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

To the question of whether some school inputs mattered more than others, we find comparable 25–32 cent returns per dollar invested in extended school years, teacher salaries, and smaller classes.

"Cendejas, José Luis; Muñoz, Félix-Fernando; Fernández-de-Pinedo, Nadia";Time series filtering methods such as the Hodrick–Prescott (HP) filter, with a consensual choice of the smoothing parameter, eliminate the possibility of identifying long swing cycles (e.g., Kondratieff type) or, alternatively, may distort periodicities that are in fact present in the data, giving rise, for example, to spurious Kuznets-type cycles. In this paper, we propose filtering Maddison’s time series for the period 1870–2010 for a selection of developed countries using a less restrictive filtering technique that does not impose but instead estimates the cutoff frequency. In particular, we use unobserved component models that optimally estimate the smoothing parameter. Using this methodology, we identify cycles of periods, primarily in the range of 4–7 years (Juglar-type cycles), and a number of patterns of cyclical convergence. We analyze the historical processes underlying this last empirical finding: Peacetime periods, monetary arrangements, trade and investment flows, and industrial boosts are confluent forces driving the economic dynamism. After 1950, we observe a common business cycle factor that groups all economies, which is consistent with the consolidation of the so-called second globalization.;2017;A contribution to the analysis of historical economic fluctuations (1870–2010): filtering, spurious cycles, and unobserved component modeling;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

We argue that colonial and sovereign debt markets were segmented owing to differences in underlying information asymmetries. The result was heterogeneous pricing of colonial and sovereign debt, and different market microstructures and clienteles, themselves influenced by political, institutional, and financial arrangements. We find that sovereign spreads mainly reflected credit risks, while colonial spreads mainly reflected liquidity risks. Liquidity premia were economically large and significant, contributing between 10 percent and 39 percent of colonial spreads. These findings help understanding why the seemingly dry subject of colonial illiquidity inspired passionate disputes and ground-breaking reforms of financial imperial institutions.;2017;“High & Dry”: The Liquidity and Credit of Colonial and Foreign Government Debt and the London Stock Exchange (1880–1910);The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Chen, Zhiwu; Peng, Kaixiang; Zhu, Lijun";"This paper constructs a quantitative history of the homicide rate in Qing China and investigates its social and economic drivers. Estimates based on historical archives indicate that this annual rate ranged between 0.35 and 1.47 per 100,000 inhabitants during the 1661–1898 period, a low level unmatched by Western Europe until the late 19th century. China's homicide rate rose steadily from 1661 to 1821 but declined gradually thereafter until the turn of the century. Although extreme, homicide represents a random sampling of the entire distribution of interpersonal violence; hence the homicide rate serves as a proxy for overall violence, and its rise implies a decline in personal security. We use national and cross-provincial panel data to show that population density, state capacity, local self-governance, interregional grain market integration, and grain price level (which captures crop failure and other survival distress) are all statistically significant drivers of the homicide rate in 18th- and 19th-century China.";2017;Social-economic change and its impact on violence: Homicide history of Qing China;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Christian, Cornelius;I examine lynchings of African Americans in the US South from 1882 to 1930, more than twenty years after Tolnay and Beck’s (1995) seminal work. The authors claim that lynchings were due to economic competition between African American and white cotton workers. I confirm much of their original hypothesis with new data and techniques, and expand upon it, finding that another explanation, Williamson’s (1997) psychosexual one, might complement the economic one. I also discover that, in line with an economic competition framework, lynchings predict more black out-migration from 1920 to 1930, and higher state-level wages.;2017;Lynchings, labour, and cotton in the US south: A reappraisal of Tolnay and Beck;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Colvin, Christopher L.;This article investigates the impact of the socioreligious segregation of Dutch society on the asset allocation choices of rural bankers and the withdrawal behavior of their depositors during the early 1920s. Results suggest that cooperatively-owned Raiffeisen banks for both Catholic and Protestant minority groups could limit their exposure to a debt-deflation crisis, despite operating more precarious balance sheets than banks for majorities. Business histories demonstrate how strict membership criteria and personal guarantors acted as screening and monitoring devices. Banks serving minorities functioned as club goods, managing their exposure to the crisis by exploiting the confessionalized nature of Dutch society.;2017;Banking on a Religious Divide: Accounting for the Success of the Netherlands' Raiffeisen Cooperatives in the Crisis of the 1920s;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Cousley, Alex; Siminski, Peter; Ville, Simon P.";Outside of the United States, few studies have estimated the effects of World War II service. In Australia, general war-time conscription and minimal involvement in the Korean War led to large cohort differences in military service rates, which we use for identification. We find a small, temporary negative effect on employment and a substantial positive effect on post-school qualifications, but not at the university level. While service increased home ownership slightly, it greatly reduced outright home ownership, consistent with the incentives provided by veterans' housing benefits. We also find a positive effect on marriage, but only from 1971.;2017;The Effects of World War II Military Service: Evidence from Australia;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Cox, Gary W.;I argue that Europe's political fragmentation interacted with her political innovations—self-governing cities and national parliaments—to facilitate “economic liberty,” which in turn unleashed faster and more inter-connected urban growth. Examining urban growth over the period 600–1800 ce throughout Eurasia, I show that inter-city growth correlations were positive and significant only in Western Europe after 1200 ce. Within Western Europe, I show that growth correlations were greatest in the most fragmented and parliamentary areas, individual cities became significantly more tied to urban growth when their realms became parliamentary, and spillover effects (due to competition between rulers) were significant.;2017;Political Institutions, Economic Liberty, and the Great Divergence;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Crafts, Nicolas F. R.; Mills, Terence C.";This paper provides a time-series analysis of recent annual estimates of real GDP and industrial output covering 1270–1913. We show that growth can be regarded as a segmented trend-stationary process. On this basis, we find that trend growth of real GDP per person was zero prior to the 1660s but then experienced two significant accelerations, pre- and post-industrial revolution. We also find that the hallmark of the industrial revolution is a substantial increase in the trend rate of growth of industrial output rather than being an episode of difference stationary growth.;2017;Six centuries of British economic growth: a time-series perspective;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Craig, Lee A.; Holt, Matthew T.";This paper examines the impact of mechanical refrigeration on temporal and spatial price relationships for regional egg markets in the United States, 1880–1911. Notably, this period encompasses an era in which widespread adoption of mechanical refrigeration facilitated the ability to store otherwise perishable commodities. This development in turn altered observed price dynamics for many perishables, including fresh eggs. We use a class of time series models, time–varying autoregressions (TVARs), to document both the structural change and the corresponding impact on spatial price dynamics for U.S. regional egg price relationships during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Our results reveal that, while spatially distinct markets remained integrated, the opportunity to store eggs over time often resulted in weaker spatial price relationships for eggs.;2017;The impact of mechanical refrigeration on market integration: The U.S. egg market, 1890–1911;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Dalrymple-smith, Angus; Frankema, Ewout H.P.";To what extent did the 18th century intensification of the transatlantic slave trade boost commercial agriculture in the coastal areas of West Africa? Exploring the provisioning strategies of 187 British, French, Dutch, and Danish slave voyages conducted between 1681 and 1807, we call for a major downward adjustment of available estimates of the slave trade-induced demand impulse. We show that during the 18th century, an increasing share of the foodstuffs required to feed African slaves were taken on board in Europe instead of West Africa. We also document considerable variation in provisioning strategies among slave trading nations and across main regions of slave embarkation. We explain these trends and variation in terms of the relative (seasonal) security of European versus African food supplies, the falling relative costs of European provisions and the increasing risks in the late 18th century trade, putting a premium on faster embarkation times.;2017;Slave ship provisioning in the long 18th century.

"Daniele, Vittorio; Foresti, Pasquale; Napolitano, Oreste";Money demand stability is a crucial issue for monetary policy efficacy, and it is particularly endangered when substantial changes occur in the monetary system. By implementing the ARDL technique, this study intends to estimate the impact of money demand determinants in Italy over a long period (1861–2011) and to investigate the stability of the estimated relations. We show that instability cannot be excluded when a standard money demand function is estimated, irrespectively of the use of M1 or M2. Then, we argue that the reason for possible instability resides in the omission of relevant variables, as we show that a fully stable demand for narrow money (M1) can be obtained from an augmented money demand function involving real exchange rate and its volatility as additional explanatory variables. These results also allow us to argue that narrower monetary aggregates should be employed in order to obtain a stable estimated relation.;2017;The stability of money demand in the long-run: Italy 1861–2011;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Diaz, Gaston;Railways were an important factor in the expansion of Latin American economies in the late-nineteenth century. Due to their potential impact, governments often promoted railway construction through subsidies. The Uruguayan state offered profit guarantees to foreign railway companies and was able to attract massive investment in the railway sector. This paper asks the question of whether these railway guarantees were efficient, and estimates subsidized and unsubsidized private returns, as well as the social returns, of the Uruguayan railway network from 1869 to 1913. The results show that subsidies more than doubled profitability, but did not compensate the opportunity cost of capital. Social returns were low relative to railways in other regions, and benefits created by new investment in each year did not justify subsidies. However, average social returns were higher than the likely returns for alternative investments and the distribution of these returns was not unfavorable to the consumers of railway services.;2017;Railway investment in Uruguay before 1914: profitability, subsidies, and economic impact;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Diebolt, Claude; Menard, Audrey-Rose; Perrin, Faustine";The education–fertility relationship is a central element of the models explaining the transition to sustained economic growth. But many determinants of this relationship have not yet received more systematic attention. In this paper, we apply a three-stages least-squares estimator on French county-level data, including newly collected data, to better understand the causal effects running from education to fertility, and vice versa. We put forward the hypothesis that a decrease in fertility was strongly associated with greater schooling in France during the nineteenth century. Besides, we emphasize the relevance of taking account of gender equality and family organization when explaining the education–fertility relationship.;2017;Behind the fertility–education nexus: what triggered the French development process?;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Dimico, Arcangelo; Isopi, Alessia; Olsson, Ola";In this article, we study the emergence of an extractive institution that hampered economic development in Italy for more than a century: the Sicilian mafia. Since its first appearance in the late 1800s, the reasons behind the rise of the Sicilian mafia have remained a puzzle. In this article, we argue that the mafia arose as a response to an exogenous shock in the demand for oranges and lemons, following Lind's discovery in the late eighteenth century that citrus fruits cured scurvy. More specifically, we claim that mafia appeared in locations where producers made high profits from citrus production for overseas export. Operating in an environment with a weak rule of law, the mafia protected citrus production from predation and acted as intermediaries between producers and exporters. Using original data from a parliamentary inquiry in 1881–1886 on Sicilian towns, the Damiani Inquiry, we show that mafia presence is strongly related to the production of oranges and lemons. The results hold when different data sources and several controls are employed.;2017;Origins of the Sicilian Mafia: The Market for Lemons;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"DOMENECH, JORDI; Herreros, Francisco";We analyze the impact of failed land reform on peasant conflict in Spain before the Civil War using a municipal data set with monthly observations of peasant conflict in Andalusia from April 1931 to July 1936. We find temporary occupations of land were rare and not correlated with either organized reaction to land reform or the existence of a large pool of beneficiaries. Potential beneficiaries of reform struck more often in the period of land reform deployment, especially in towns with a legacy of domination by a noble family and no previous experience of reform. There is some evidence that actual land reform implementation reduced strikes, most prominently in towns that had not been affected by land reform until the 1930s. We argue both sets of evidence suggest that faster re-distribution would have reduced conflict and that the effects of incomplete land reform were stronger in towns with no previous history of land reform.;2017;Land reform and peasant revolution.

Downs, Carolyn;This article takes a case study approach to the question of how entrepreneurs developed and used networks to support trade during the American Revolutionary War (American War of Independence). Using the business letter books of Daniel Eccleston of Lancaster, covering January 1780 to December 1781, the article shows how he used trust-building activities and developed open networks in Britain and the West Indies in order to build, sustain, maintain, and diversify his commercial activities to reduce risk and develop new opportunities. Eccleston's letters illustrate a competitive market in which entrepreneurs helped drive the industrial revolution through stimulating demand and encouraging trade. They show that mutual trust was the foundation of strong networks, and that networks were significant in underpinning entrepreneurial success through allowing the mitigation of business risk and offering the opportunity for diversification supported by the network. The article makes use of the work of Casson, Pearson and Richardson, and Wilson and Pop.;2017;Networks, trust, and risk mitigation during the American Revolutionary War: a case study;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Dribe, Martin; Olsson, Mats; Svensson, Patrick";The social consequences of agrarian change have been widely debated. The traditional view of the lower classes becoming increasingly vulnerable due to the loss of access to resources has been met with the revisionist view that this change was counteracted by an increase in the volume and regularity of employment due to investments and new farming practices. This article address this issue by studying the agricultural revolution in southern Sweden using aggregate data at the parish level. New micro-level data on actual harvest outcomes, supplemented by price data, make it possible to differentiate between the development of the local economy and exogenous price shocks. Our results indicate a clear mortality response to harvest fluctuations in general and to harvest failures in particular. The response differed greatly between farming regions, being strongest in the areas most dependent on grain production. The response also diminished during the agricultural revolution, indicating the increasing efficiency of the local economy. This indicates employment effects in line with the revisionist view. At the same time, vulnerability to fluctuations in prices of basic foodstuffs remained high until the second half of the nineteenth century and was also quite similar across farming regions.;2017;The agricultural revolution and the conditions of the rural poor, southern Sweden, 1750–1860;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Edvinsson, Rodney Benjamin;This study examines whether there was a Malthusian equilibrium mechanism in Sweden in the pre-industrial period. A unique data set on harvests, deaths, marriages and births going back to 1630 is used to calculate cumulative elasticities of vital rates with respect to harvest. While earlier studies have mostly focused on the impact of real wage, this study uses the calorie content of per capita harvests as an indicator of living standards. It finds that there indeed was a response of vital rates to harvest fluctuations, but there were important structural breaks. While positive checks attenuated after 1720, preventive checks were strengthened. After 1870 preventive checks disappeared, and possibly also positive checks. The results are robust to different models and trend specifications, with one crucial difference: while the distributed lag model shows that positive checks were significant up to 1920, the SVAR model shows that positive checks disappeared after 1870.;2017;The response of vital rates to harvest fluctuations in pre-industrial Sweden;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Espín-Sánchez, José-Antonio;"In 1966, after more than 700 years, the irrigation community in Mula (Spain) switched from auctions to quotas to allocate water from its river. This change happened in the absence of either political or technological change. Quotas were more efficient, but required that farmers own water property rights. I develop a model in which poor farmers cannot credibly commit to purchase water rights. I show that empirical evidence on savings and prices is consistent with this interpretation. A temporary increase in output prices in the 1950s and better financial institutions allowed farmers to accumulate savings and solve the commitment problem.

"Federico, Giovanni; Tena-Junguito, Antonio";Since the seminal work by W. A. Lewis, exports of primary products have been deemed the main or sole source of growth in tropical countries before the Great Depression. However, this conventional wisdom relies on very limited evidence. This article analyses the growth of exports with a constant market share analysis for 84 tropical polities. Exports grew a lot, but less than total trade, while relative prices of tropical products remained roughly constant. We thus tentatively infer that the decline in the tropical shares of world trade reflects an insufficient demand for tropical products. Asia dealt well with these headwinds throughout the whole period, while African polities blossomed after the First World War. The loser was (South) America, and most notably the Caribbean former slave colonies, especially before 1870.;2017;Lewis revisited: tropical polities competing on the world market, 1830–1938;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Fernández, Eva; Simpson, James";Wine cooperatives were relatively scarce in Europe before the Second World War, but by the 1980s accounted for more than half of all wines made in France, Italy, and Spain, the three major producer countries. Unlike Danish dairy cooperatives, whose success before the First World War was linked to their ability to improve product quality and compete in high-value niche markets, wine cooperatives are often associated with the production of large volumes of low-quality products. This article argues that the initial slow diffusion of wine cooperatives was caused by the difficulties of improving quality due to environmental conditions in European vineyards (?terroir?) and measurement problems, rather than institutional shortcomings. Cooperatives only became widespread when the state found them a useful instrument to regulate markets, especially after 1950. The problems associated with poor wine quality were never resolved, and cooperatives have become increasingly uncompetitive in the market place, especially following the major decline in per capita consumption and shift towards premium wines from the 1980s.;2017;Product quality or market regulation?

Fetter, Daniel K.;A key question in the design of public assistance to the needy is how allocation of responsibility for funding and decision-making across different levels of government influences the level and type of assistance provided. The New Deal era was a period in which this allocation changed significantly in the United States, as provision of public assistance shifted from local governments to states and the federal government, accompanied by a large increase in government transfer payments. Focusing on assistance to the elderly and using variation in state laws governing the division of funding between local and state governments for the Old Age Assistance (OAA) Program, this paper investigates the responsiveness of OAA payments and recipiency to local government funding shares. Payments per elderly resident were significantly lower in states with higher local funding shares, driven largely by reductions in recipiency. The baseline results suggest that had local governments needed to fund half of OAA payments in 1939, on the lower end of local funding shares prior to the New Deal, the share of the elderly receiving OAA would have been 5 percent rather than 22 percent, and perhaps even lower. More speculative results suggest that greater local funding led to lower representation of blacks among OAA recipients relative to their share of the population, particularly in the South.;2017;Local government and old-age support in the New Deal;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Gallegati, Marco; Gallegati, Mauro; Ramsey, James B.; Semmler, Willi";In this paper we apply wavelet analysis to study the dynamics of long-term movements in wholesale prices for the USA, the UK and France over the period 1791–2012. The application of wavelet analysis to long-term historical price series allows us to detect long waves in prices whose periodization is remarkably similar to those provided in the literature for the pre-World War II period. Moreover, we find evidence on the existence of long waves in prices also after World War II, a period in which long waves are generally difficult to detect because of the positive trend displayed by prices. The comparison between the long wave components extracted through wavelets and the Christiano–Fitzgerald band-pass filter suggests that wavelets provide a reliable and straightforward technique for analyzing long waves dynamics in time series exhibiting quite complex patterns such as historical data.;2017;Long waves in prices: new evidence from wavelet analysis;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

GARRIDO, SAMUEL;There is no consensus among specialists in agricultural contracts over whether the long-term inefficiencies that classical economists attributed to sharecropping actually exist. This article maintains that they do exist and are partly caused by the fact that sharecropping is hardly compatible with the tenant being compensated for improvements, viticulture being the main historical exception. In line with recent contributions to the sharecropping literature, the article contends that the widely held belief among scholars of agricultural contracts that sharecropping was very frequent in Europe's vineyards is incorrect. However, it also provides evidence of an issue whose importance has gone largely unnoticed: prior to the twentieth century, many of the European vineyards worked by sharecroppers had been created by the sharecroppers themselves, through contracts which entitled them to compensation. Those contracts abounded while viticulture depended basically on two inputs, land and labour. When viticulture became a heavy consumer of capital, they were rapidly abandoned, but not in Catalonia, with a paradoxical result: the Catalan rabassa morta contract, which for centuries had made it possible to eliminate both the long- and short-term inefficiencies of sharecropping, ended up becoming an obstacle to overcoming the short-term inefficiencies. The article discusses why that happened.;2017;Sharecropping was sometimes efficient: sharecropping with compensation for improvements in European viticulture†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"González, Felipe; Marshall, Guillermo; Naidu, Suresh";Slave property rights yielded a source of collateral as well as a coerced labor force.

We assess a number of potential explanations, and find suggestive evidence that this is due to the superiority of slave wealth as a source of collateral for credit rather than any advantage in production. The collateral dimension of slave property magnifies its importance to historical American economic development.;2017;Start-up Nation?

Even though a few attempts have been made to analyse whether market potential might influence urban structures, this period is especially interesting because it is characterised by advances in the economic integration of the national market together with an intense process of industrialisation. By using an elaborated measure of market potential at the city level, our results show a positive influence of this market potential on city growth, although this influence is heterogeneous over time.

Gregg, Amanda G.;During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, western European countries introduced general incorporation and additional flexible enterprise forms, but the Russian Empire left its concession system of incorporation in place. The Empire's only major corporation reform, the 1901 law, strengthened minority shareholder rights and removed bankers from boards of directors for certain corporations. The reform offers a rare opportunity to examine the financial effects of improving corporations? principal?agent relationships through regulation, because the reform did not affect all corporations equally. Corporations affected by the reform had smaller total share capital, fewer shares, and higher par values for shares as observed in 1905. The new regulations may have increased the cost of having shareholders and hence disciplined corporations? founders to be more conservative in raising capital by issuing stock. Removing bankers from boards of directors may have removed an important source of firms? founding capital, though corporations could easily evade this provision. The results also show that, although the commercial code treated all corporations equally, there were two major groups of Russian corporations that behaved differently, and, despite the fact that corporate charters could grant individual exceptions to the commercial code, a revision in the commercial code changed corporations? behaviour.;2017;Shareholder rights and share capital: the effect of the 1901 Russian Corporation Reform, 1890–1905;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Haas, Michiel de;Recent scholarship on historical welfare development in Sub-Saharan Africa has uncovered long-term trends in standards of living. How the majority of rural dwellers fared, however, remains largely elusive. This study develops a new approach to reconstruct rural living standards in a historical context. It builds upon a well-established real wage literature, but moves beyond it to capture rural realities, employing sub-national rural survey, census, and price data. The approach is applied to a case study of colonial and early post-colonial Uganda (1915?70). The case study yields a number of findings. While the expanding smallholder-based cash crop sector established itself as the backbone of Uganda's colonial economy, farm characteristics remained largely stagnant after the initial adoption of cash crops. Smallholders maintained living standards well above subsistence level, and while the profitability of cash crops was low, their cultivation provided a reliable source of cash income. Around the time of decolonization, unskilled wages rose rapidly while farm incomes lagged behind. As a result, an urban?rural income reversal took place. The study also reveals considerable differences within Uganda. Smallholders in Uganda's banana regions required fewer labour inputs to maintain a farm income than their grain-farming counterparts, creating opportunities for additional income generation and livelihood diversification.;2017;Measuring rural welfare in colonial Africa: did Uganda's smallholders thrive?;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Hao, Yu; Xue, Melanie Meng";This paper tests the hypothesis that the cultural distance between migrants and natives impedes the provision of public goods. The Taiping Rebellion was a shock that caused groups without a history of shared governance to be relocated to the same region. We use a unique historical dataset of surnames in the Lower Yangzi of China to construct a measure of the cultural distance between migrants and natives (MNCD). We find that a one-standard-deviation increase in the MNCD is associated with a decrease of over 0.19 public primary schools per 10,000 persons in the early twentieth century. The results survive various robustness checks and an instrumental variable analysis that exploits the pre-existing cultural distances between the native and the nearby population. Evidence from the timing of when the MNCD takes effect suggests that the primary mechanism runs from migrant-native cultural distance through quality of collective decision-making to modern primary education.;2017;Friends from afar: The Taiping Rebellion, cultural proximity and primary schooling in the Lower Yangzi, 1850–1949;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Despite a boom in manufacturing activity during the war, the evidence is not consistent with differential postwar growth in counties that received more investment. This does not rule out positive effects of mobilization on firms or sectors, but a decisive role for wartime capital deepening in the South's postwar industrial development should be viewed more skeptically.;2017;World War II and the Industrialization of the American South;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"JOHNSON, NOEL D.; Koyama, Mark";State capacity has become one of the most discussed concepts in development economics and political economy. In this survey we argue that the study of economic history provides vital insights into the process through which modern states have acquired ‘state capacity’. By evaluating the process of state building across a range of different countries in Europe and Asia, we are able to ‘decompress’ the relationship between state capacity and economic growth. Our analysis emphasizes the variegated nature of the state building process. We focus on recent research that helps to elucidate the mechanisms that relate state capacity to economic growth.;2017;States and economic growth: Capacity and constraints;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
JOPP, TOBIAS A.;Throughout the late 1920s, German coal mining saw an exceptional surge in labour productivity, led by the performance of the Ruhr coal mines. It is commonly accepted in the relevant literature that the economy-wide ?rationalization boom? explains that pattern. This study tests the related hypothesis that ?negative rationalization?, in the form of a massive wave of mine closures over the period 1924?9, played a significant role in stimulating aggregate labour productivity in the Ruhr coal district. Using an original dataset for the totality of Ruhr coal mines, the causes of productivity change over the broader period 1913?38 are identified, using the decomposition method of Foster, Haltiwanger, and Krizan. Results suggest that labour productivity was driven largely by improvements at individual mines, attributable to the intensified mechanization of underground operations. In sharp contrast, turnover effects were marginal, overall, compared to the effects stemming from the producer dynamics among surviving mines. Thus, the practical productivity implications of mine closures during the rationalization boom are negligible and overrated in the literature. These findings indicate the necessity of testing the relative importance of ?negative rationalization? in the form of plant closures in other branches of the Weimar economy.;2017;Did closures do any good?

"Jun, Bogang; Kim, Tai-Yoo";This study examined the relationship between land inequality and human capital accumulation in the Korean colonial period by using a panel data set from 1934 to 1942. Evidence of the adverse relationship between land inequality and the accumulation of human capital has thus far only been presented by using data from Western countries and from countries that achieved industrialization not under colonial occupation but by their own economic interest. The presented findings thus contribute to the body of knowledge on this topic and confirm the generalizability of the Galor model by analyzing the unique Korean context under Japanese rule in the early twentieth century. It is the first study to present evidence that inequality in landownership had an adverse effect on the level of public education in the Korean colonial period (i.e., it is a non-financial hurdle for human capital accumulation). By using a fixed effects model and a fixed effects two-stage least squares model with an instrumental variable estimation, this study exploits variation in inequality in land concentration across regions in Korea, accounting for the unobserved heterogeneity across these regions. Overall, this analysis establishes a highly significant adverse effect of land inequality on education in the Korean colonial period.;2017;Non-financial hurdles for human capital accumulation: landownership in Korea under Japanese rule;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
KALLIOINEN, MIKA;This article examines the institutional structure of medieval overseas trade to explain why trade thrived even in the absence of the state. The literature has dealt mainly with intra-coalition or intra-community relations. However, the literature does not answer the question of how institutions could be created that could support interaction between a large number of distant communities and between merchants who did not necessarily know one another. This article presents such an institution that prevailed in the Baltic Sea region in the late middle ages, referred to here as the inter-communal conciliation mechanism. In case of a dispute, conciliation took place between town councils, rather than the merchants involved in the dispute, thus combining individual liability and communal enforcement. Exploration of the documents reveals a task-specific regularity of behaviour, which was the general practice among merchants to turn to the council of their own community when they had problems in a foreign town, instead of being obliged to solve disputes by themselves. This institution provided a permanent, centralized, and relatively impartial enforcement mechanism to respond to breaches. It was therefore well adapted to large, at least partially anonymous markets, such as the Baltic Sea region, with dozens of towns and thousands of merchants.;2017;Inter-communal institutions in medieval trade;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Keller, Wolfgang; Andres Santiago, Javier; Shiue, Carol H.";We employ a new, commodity-level dataset on the flow of goods between fifteen major treaty ports to estimate a general-equilibrium trade model for China in the late Qing era. The distribution of welfare effects depends critically on each port's productivity, China's economic geography as it influences trade costs, as well as the degree of regional diversity in production, which increases the potential gains from trade. We utilize this framework to quantify the size and distribution of welfare effects resulting from new technology and lower trade costs that emerged during the Treaty-Port Era. Our results suggest that the new trade with foreign countries led to significant changes in domestic trade relationships. There was a limit to how much could be gained through increased domestic trade, however, because differences in productivity across regions were relatively low.;2017;China's domestic trade during the Treaty-Port Era;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Using estimation methods, including a fixed-effect model and the instrumental variable approach, we find that the informal economy and shortages reinforced each other. Results indicate that the Soviet central planning system was difficult to sustain.

"Kitchens, Carl T.; Jaworski, Taylor";In this paper, we quantify the difference between public and private prices of residential electricity immediately before and after major federal reforms in the 1930s and 1940s. Previous research found that public prices were lower in a sample of large, urban markets. Based on new data covering over 15,000 markets and nearly all electricity generated for residential consumption, we find that the difference between public and private prices was small in 1935 and negligible in 1940 for typical levels of monthly consumption. These findings are consistent with a market for ownership that helped to discipline electricity prices during this period. That is, private rents were mitigated by the threat that municipalities would use public ownership to respond to constituent complaints and public rents were limited by electoral competition and the growth of private provision.;2017;Ownership and the price of residential electricity: Evidence from the United States, 1935–1940;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Klovland, Jan Tore; Øksendal, Lars Fredrik";Before 1893 the regional branches of Norges Bank set their own bank rates. We discuss this phenomenon in light of the process of domestic financial integration taking place in the 19th century. Moreover, we analyze how bank rate autonomy could be reconciled with the fixed exchange rate commitments of the silver and gold standard. Although the headquarters of the bank was in Trondhjem, we find that the Christiania branch played the key role in providing leadership in bank rate policy. Foreign interest rate impulses were important for bank rate decisions, but there was also some leeway for responding to idiosyncratic shocks facing the Norwegian economy.;2017;The decentralized central bank: bank rate autonomy and capital market integration in Norway, 1850–1892;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Li, Dan; Li, Nan";How do initial arrival conditions in a host locality affect migrants’ subsequent economic welfare? Manchuria (Northeast China), which attracted millions of migrants from North China during the first half of the twentieth century, experienced a devastating pneumonic plague outbreak in 1910–11. Using data from a rural household survey in the mid-1930s, we explore how the post-plague conditions in various villages affected migrant cohorts’ long-term wealth accumulation. We find that the migrant households that moved to plague-hit villages soon after the plague ended prospered the most: they owned at least 112% more land than migrant households that either moved elsewhere or migrated to the same village before or long after the plague outbreak. Our results are robust after controlling for factors that influence the long-term wealth accumulation of migrants and are not caused by selection.;2017;Moving to the right place at the right time: Economic effects on migrants of the Manchuria Plague of 1910–11;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Li, Ling-Fan;Based on the exchange rates collected from Datini's correspondence, this article demonstrates that a high degree of financial market integration, in terms of communication, had been achieved by the end of the fourteenth century. The speed of exchange rate adjustment and transaction costs were greatly influenced by the distance between markets and the extra time incurred to complete arbitrage. Though resulting in higher transaction costs, government intervention in exchange dealings led to more effective arbitrage because more information relating to exchange movement was transmitted between merchants more quickly.;2017;Arbitrage, communication, and market integration at the time of Datini;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Logan, Trevon D.; Parman, John M.";Exploiting complete census manuscript files, we derive a new segregation measure using the racial similarity of next-door neighbors. The fineness of our measure reveals new facts not captured by traditional segregation indices. First, segregation doubled nationally from 1880 to 1940. Second, contrary to prior estimates, Southern urban areas were the most segregated in the country and remained so over time. Third, increasing segregation in the twentieth century was not strictly driven by urbanization, black migration, or white flight: it resulted from increasing racial sorting at the household level. In all areas—North and South, urban and rural—segregation increased dramatically.;2017;The National Rise in Residential Segregation;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Long, Leah E.;Urbanization across the Roman Empire created a demand for building materials on an unprecedented scale. Quarrying was largely conducted by municipalities, institutions, or landed aristocrats, who owned or inherited the valuable land from which stone was extracted. By using principles of economics as a guide, and with greater coordination between theory and written and archaeological sources, this article examines the decision-making processes involved in opening a quarry. Theories of economic rationality, resource economics, and statistical methods are helpful for understanding the prices for marble recorded in Diocletian's Edict, Roman jurists? writings about exploitation on private land, and newly discovered quarries in the region of Aphrodisias, Turkey. Here it is argued that the exchange of local building stone took place in a competitive market where landowners actively tried to improve their financial situation, but did so at considerable risk. At Aphrodisias, examples of failed attempts exist alongside long-running and successful enterprises. Entrepreneurs there did not extract a homogeneous set of resources, but chose to target marbles with inconsistent physical properties at increasing distances from the city in response to greater demand and rising prices. Roman jurists, primarily interested in protecting property value, made landowners calculate whether potential profits earned from sales outweighed the degradation of land.;2017;Extracting economics from Roman marble quarries†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Malinowski, Mikołaj; van Zanden, Jan Luiten";This article presents per capita GDP and income distribution estimates for preindustrial Poland. It is based on a social table for the Voivodeship of Cracow in 1578. Our evidence indicates that income in Poland was distributed more equally than in contemporary Holland. However, the extraction rate was much higher than in the North Sea area. Furthermore, income inequality in the countryside of the Voivodeship was higher than inequality in Cracow. This can be explained by the demesne economy based on serfdom that was prevalent in agriculture. Using trends in real wages and urbanisation, we also project Polish GDP forwards and backwards in time. Our results indicate that Polish per capita GDP was below that of Western Europe as early as the fifteenth century. This gap persisted despite moderate growth of the Polish economy in the sixteenth century. In the seventeenth century, Poland impoverished and became even poorer than Asian economies for which similar estimates are available. Poland recovered slightly in the eighteenth century but continued to lag behind Western Europe.;2017;Income and its distribution in preindustrial Poland;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Meinzer, Nicholas J.;Estimates of inequality of living standards based on average height differences between socioeconomic strata are likely biased if the social status of some individuals changed during their lifetime. Height differences estimated from skeletal remains, reflecting living standards during childhood and adolescence, are probably too small if social status is inferred based on grave goods which are associated with the individuals’ social status at the time of their death. The higher the level of social mobility, the more distinguished individuals will not have had a privileged childhood and, therefore, have the biological characteristics of the disadvantaged group. In a newly assembled sample of individual level anthropometric data from 26 early medieval row grave cemeteries in south-western Germany, men buried with a long sword in their grave were on average about 3cm taller than the others. In a simple model of the mechanics of the social-mobility bias, this height difference, together with parameters from the literature, implies a level of social mobility typical of small-scale agricultural or pastoral societies.;2017;Social mobility in the early middle ages;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Nakamura, Yasushi;Newly available Soviet data reveal that government debt increased to compensate for inefficient use of funds for most of the Soviet period. Given the difficulty in managing fiat money without information and data generated by the market, and the simple Soviet financial structure, the increasing debt suggests that non-performing financial assets accumulated in the household sector, and inefficient real assets built up in the enterprise sector. The empirical analysis using a small time-varying parameter vector autoregression model identified that funds supplied to the economy had contributed at a decreasing rate to economic growth during nearly the entire Soviet period. Funds continued to be used wastefully, non-performing financial assets accumulated, and consequently the value of the ruble was decreasing. In this sense, Soviet monetary management was inefficient. Future research will include efforts to investigate responsiveness of price regulating authorities to changes in monetary and financial situation, to understand monetary management on the republic level, and to quantify the efficiency of use of funds.;2017;The relationship between the real and financial economies in the Soviet Union: An analysis of government debts using newly available data;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

OFFER, AVNER;Social democracy and market liberalism provide different solutions to the same problem: how to provide for life-cycle dependency. Social democracy makes lateral transfers from producers to dependents by means of progressive taxation. Market liberalism uses financial markets to transfer financial entitlement over time. Social democracy came up against the upper limits of public expenditure in the 1970s. The ?market turn? from social democracy to market liberalism was enabled by liberalized credit in the 1980s. Much of this was absorbed into homeownership, which attracted majorities of households (and voters) in the developed world. Early movers did well, but eventually easy credit drove house prices beyond the reach of younger cohorts. Debt service diminished effective demand, which instigated financial instability. Both social democracy and market liberalism are currently in crisis.;2017;The market turn: from social democracy to market liberalism;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"OKAZAKI, TETSUJI; Sawada, Michiru";This paper explores the extent of political connections of firms, and examines the implications for firm values, using firm-level data from prewar Japan. We collect data from publicly traded companies in Japan in the late 1920s and early 1930s regarding their directors and presence of members of the House of Representatives, stock prices, and financial performance. We find that almost 20% of these publicly traded companies had political connections through politician directors. In particular, firms in regulated industries, including the electrical utility and railroad industries, were more likely to have political connections. Regression analyses reveal that the stock returns of firms with newly- obtained political connections improved from the pre-election to post-election periods. Furthermore, this positive effect accrued to non-regulated industries, while it did not to regulated industries.;2017;Measuring the extent and implications of corporate political connections in prewar Japan;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Outram, Quentin;This article concerns the effect of income and other variables on the demand for residential domestic service in London in 1901 and presents the first estimated model of the demand for residential service known to the author. It uses previously unexploited data consisting of the incomes and household details of some 500 civil servants. An extension of Becker's model of household production is set out and an ordered probit statistical model of servant demand is estimated. The results confirm the importance of income but also show that the demographic composition of the household was of significance. These results are interpreted in terms of age- and gender-related differences in the supply of labour and the demand for market goods. The results are consistent with the view that middle-class Edwardian households should be understood as sites of production as well as consumption. A comparison of the statistical results with contemporary recommendations in manuals of household management suggests that those recommendations were typically over-optimistic. The article presents a ?ready reckoner? whereby household income may be estimated from the number of resident servants, but caution in its use is urged.;2017;The demand for residential domestic service in the London of 1901†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
PAIVA ABREU, MARCELO de;The British war effort in the Second World War depended on US Lend-Lease and the accumulation of sterling balances by other countries, including the Empire. By the end of the war outstanding balances were equivalent to 60 per cent of British net receipts under Lend-Lease. Of the total sterling balances, about a third was accumulated by India. This article seeks to evaluate the costs incurred by India in the reduction of balances after the war. The accumulation of balances and their use to repatriate India's sterling debt is described. British efforts to convince India to accept a partial cancellation of the balances are analysed, singling out the crucial role of Keynes. The negotiations after independence are detailed, including releases, transfers to Pakistan, settlement of pensions, purchase of military stores, and gold sales. The possible contribution of British divestment to reduce outstanding balances is assessed. The Indian case is compared with those of other holders, such as Portugal, Brazil, Argentina, and Egypt. The links between the accumulation of sterling balances and inflation are considered. In the end there was a significant reduction in the purchasing power of sterling balances, but not for the reasons anticipated by London.;2017;Britain as a debtor: Indian sterling balances, 1940–53;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

In this PhD dissertation, I assess some of the effects for the early modern European economy which resulted from the large-scale discovery and exploitation of precious metals in the New World. I argue that the monetary injections, which were a direct result of the increased availability of precious metals, were an important cause of stimulus for several early modern European economies. The thesis mainly consists of three papers. In the first paper, I argue variation in production of precious metals in America can be helpful to identifying the causal effects of money in a macroeconomic setting. Using a panel of six European countries for the period 1531–1790, I find strong reduced-form evidence in favor of non-neutrality of money for changes in real economic activity. The magnitudes are substantial and persist for a long time: an exogenous 10% increase in production of precious metals in America leads to a hump-shaped positive response of real GDP, peaking at an average increase of 1.3% 4 years later. The evidence suggests this is because prices responded to monetary injections only with considerable lags. The following two chapters are focused on different aspects of the measurement and analysis of the causal effects of the monetary injections for the English economy. In the second paper, I put forward new data on annual coin supply for England over the long run.1 This is offered not only as a data construction exercise within the specific context of England, but also as a methodological contribution which in principle can be reproduced for some other countries. Finally, in the third paper, I present a historical discussion of the long-term effects of the early modern monetary injections in the context of the English economy. I show the increased availability of precious metals led to liquidity injections which matter for our understanding of the English industrious, industrial, and financial revolutions during early modern period.";2017;Harbingers of modernity: monetary injections and European economic growth, 1492–1790;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Papaioannou, Kostadis J.;This study uses rainfall variation as an instrumental variable for rice production to estimate the impact of poverty on different types of crime across British colonies in South and South East Asia (1910-–1940). Using original primary sources retrieved from annual administrative and statistical reports, it provides some of the first evidence in a historical setting on the causal relationship between poverty and crime. Extreme rainfall, both droughts and floods, lead to a large increase in property crimes (such as robbery, petty theft, and cattle raiding), but not to an increase in interpersonal violent crimes (such as murder, homicides, and assault). In line with a growing body of literature on the climate-economy nexus, this study offers evidence that loss of agricultural income is one of the main causal channels leading to property crime. Additional historical information on food shortages, poverty, and crime is used to explore the connection in greater detail.;2017;“Hunger makes a thief of any man”: Poverty and crime in British colonial Asia;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The first occurred in the middle of the seventeenth century when real wages in centres of trade and finance located on the rim of the North Sea rose far above the level prevailing in their hinterland. The second stage unfolded from the second quarter of the eighteenth century when the real wage in south England, northern and central Italy, and Germany began to diverge; Germany followed a middle path between the other two countries.

We then track the evolution of the sampled working skills across three centuries of English history, from 1550 to 1850. We observe a modest rise in the share of ‘high-quality workmen’ deemed necessary by Mokyr and others to facilitate the Industrial Revolution, including machine erectors and operators. But we also find remarkable growth in the share of unskilled workers, rising from 20 % in the late sixteenth century to nearly 40 % in the early nineteenth century, caused mainly by falling shares of semi-skilled, blue-collar workers. Close inspection of the occupational structures within the main sectors of production suggests that deskilling occurred in agriculture and industry alike, prompted by land concentration in agriculture and workshop-to-factory changes in industry.;2017;Human capital formation from occupations: the ‘deskilling hypothesis’ revisited;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Ploeckl, Florian;The measurement of urbanization rates and other uses of statistical information, for example the use of historical town growth to measure long-term economic growth, are usually based on an ad hoc population threshold to define and practically classify settlements as towns. The method, however, trades off accuracy and precision for convenience and simplicity. This paper proposes a new threshold that uses the town size distribution together with agricultural data to derive an appropriate cutoff value. The relevance of agricultural income is integrated into the classification scheme through the differential effect of local agricultural endowments on settlement size. The threshold is chosen such that the size of towns above the cutoff is statistically not influenced by local agricultural endowments, while the size of villages, which is below the threshold, is indeed shaped by them. This new approach is practically demonstrated with an application to the urban system of the nineteenth century in the German region of Saxony. This setting is used to investigate the relevance of a different classification for the development of urbanization over time and Gibrat’s law. The results demonstrate that the underlying classification scheme matters strongly for the conclusions drawn from historical urban data. They also indicate that the use of a common population threshold for a comparative analysis or temporal comparisons in a historical context increases the misclassifications of settlements.;2017;Towns (and villages): definitions and implications in a historical setting;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Postel-Vinay, Natacha;The idea that real estate could have contributed to banking crises during the Great Depression has been downplayed due to the conservatism of mortgage contracts at the time. For instance, loan-to-value ratios often did not exceed 50 per cent. Using newly discovered archival documents and data from 1934, this article uncovers a darker side of 1920s US mortgage lending: the so-called ?second mortgage system?. As borrowers often could not make a 50 per cent down payment, a majority of them took second mortgages at usurious rates. As theory predicts, debt dilution, even in the presence of seniority rules, can be highly detrimental to both junior and senior lenders. The probability of default on first mortgages was likely to increase, and commercial banks were more likely to foreclose. Through foreclosure they would still be able to retrieve 50 per cent of the property value, but often after a protracted foreclosure process. This would have put further strain on banks during liquidity crises. This article is thus a timely reminder that second mortgages, or ?piggyback loans? as they are called today, can be hazardous to lenders and borrowers alike. It provides further empirical evidence that debt dilution can be detrimental to credit.;2017;Debt dilution in 1920s America: lighting the fuse of a mortgage crisis;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

REIS, JAIME;This study offers an estimate of Portuguese income inequality over a period of more than 200 years. It is presented in three widely spaced benchmarks: 1565, 1700 and 1770. This entirely new index is based in large measure on a little-researched annual personal income tax (décima) instituted in 1641. It covered all social classes, including nobility and clergy and every form of household earnings, and permits therefore a singularly accurate measure. It allows us to conclude that, in contrast with early modern Europe in general, Portugal experienced a notable decline in economic inequality. Several freshly minted quantitative indicators enable us to conclude that the burden of the explanation for this apparently ‘deviant’ behaviour can be ascribed to changes in the functional distribution of income. Significant transformations in Portuguese agriculture—towards labour-intensive products like maize and wine—permanently shifted the wage–rental ratio in favour of labour. The skill premium fell but its contribution was relatively modest. It was a time of sustained economic growth, but this was not associated with pronounced urbanization or industrialization.;2017;Deviant behaviour?

A long-standing tradition in the literature concerning living standards in pre-industrial France has focused on the study of specific regions, what Philip Hoffman (2000) has eloquently called “local economics.” Yet, to date, there is no comprehensive understanding of the long-term development of wages, prices, and economic performance from a broader national perspective. On the basis of newly constructed data-set containing more than 22,000 wage observations and almost 49,000 price observations, this dissertation provides a comprehensive empirical reconstruction of some of the key macro-economic aggregates of France from the phase of early state formation to the Revolution.
The first section presents new series of real wages for male agricultural laborers and construction workers in France from 1250 to 1789. The analysis highlights three main issues. First, the real wage series suggest that there were only limited long run improvements in living standards for French wage earners before the Industrial Revolution. Second, the estimates reveal that the period 1370–1500 saw the emergence and consolidation of a real wage gap between France and England (with English wages pulling ahead) as well as other leading European cities. Indeed, after a first phase of rapid expansion following the Black Death, by the 1370s real wages in France grew less than elsewhere in Europe where, instead, real wage improvements kept on consolidating till the 1450s. Investigating the origins of this trend, I show that the Hundred Years’ War, with its negative effects on production and labor demand, as well as debasement were important factors in explaining the chronology of the gap in real wages between France and England. Finally, even if demographic data before the 1550s are fragmentary and fragile, it is possible to argue, consistently with the Malthusian interpretation, that the interaction between real wages and population was characterized by a long-lasting inverse relationship. However, while this mechanism appears to hold in general, one can detect a structural break in the relationship that points to a transition from a “high” to a “low” pressure Malthusian regime at least by the early seventeenth century.";2017;The French economy in the longue durée: a study on real wages, working days and economic performance from Louis IX to the Revolution (1250–1789);European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"RUTTERFORD, JANETTE; SOTIROPOULOS, DIMITRIS P.; van LIESHOUT, CARRY";This article examines the long-run evolution of local bias by UK investors between the 1870s and the 1930s. It uses a large sample of nearly 30,000 shareholders based on 197 sets of share records, a large and representative database of the investor population across sectors and time. It investigates the structure and the evolution of local investment preference between shareholders and the companies in which they invested, as measured by the distance between where they lived and corporate headquarters. The study offers evidence of strong initial local investment preference, which declined over time for non-Londoners, but remained strong for Londoners until the 1930s. Local investment preference of security holders was related to the size of the board of directors and, for wealthy investors, was related to the age of the firm. For large firms, local networks between investors and directors appear stronger when director shareholdings and voting rights were important. This study supports the analytical hypothesis of local informal trust networks between investors and directors as a means to overcome informational asymmetries and weak legal protection, and provides evidence that local preference was a means to curb insider opportunism and private benefits of control.;2017;Individual investors and local bias in the UK, 1870–1935;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Saaritsa, Sakari;The literature on intrahousehold allocation in European history has typically built on bargaining models originating from Amartya Sen and the South Asian “missing girls” paradigm, testing hypotheses of male earner bias. Often, a 50/50 benchmark has been used, assuming any skew in spending meant discrimination. This study combines external measures of variation in morbidity by age, sex and season with analysis of household health expenditure in Finland in the 1920s. The results suggest that money largely followed sickness rather than gender or earnings. This supports an emerging literature challenging bargaining models and suggesting that significant historical differences may have existed between world regions.;2017;Forever gender equal and child friendly?

Saavedra, Martin;Using city-of-birth data from the 100% sample of the 1880 Census merged to city-level fatality counts, I estimate the relationship between early-life yellow fever exposure and adult occupational status. I find that white males with immigrant mothers were less likely to become professionals and more likely to become unskilled laborers or report occupational nonresponse if they were born during yellow fever epidemics. They also reported occupations with lower 1900 occupational income scores. The children of U.S.-born mothers (who were less susceptible to the disease) were relatively unaffected. Furthermore, I find no evidence that epidemics 3 to 4 years after birth affect adult occupational status, and the results are robust to controlling for local trade during an individual's birth year.;2017;Early-life disease exposure and occupational status: The impact of yellow fever during the 19th century;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Using a database compiled from widows' pension files, I estimate the effect this had on widows' remarriage decisions. I find that receiving a pension lowered the hazard rate of remarriage by 25 percent, which implies an increase in the median time to remarriage of 3.5 years. Among older women, the effect is greater.

Sasaki, Yu;"This article examines the causes and variation of language standardization across European ethnic groups from a historical perspective. Although language has long garnered interest in the study of ethnicity and nationalism, how language becomes standardized has yet to be offered. In this article, I argue that the acquisition of the printing press is critical to explaining the occurrence and variation of standardization. Using the first publication of vernacular dictionaries as a proxy for standardization, I present a systematic investigation of the standardization process for 171 ethnic groups in Europe from 1400–2000 ce. Empirical tests come from an original data set that collects information on political, economic, and social dimensions. Findings from event history models show that (1) printing press adoption is positively and significantly correlated with vernacular dictionaries; and (2) early adopters are more likely to standardize vernaculars than latecomers.";2017;Publishing Nations: Technology Acquisition and Language Standardization for European Ethnic Groups;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Schalk, Ruben;Employing novel data on over 400 apprenticed orphaned boys from the Dutch cities of Leiden and Utrecht, this article explores the functioning of apprenticeship during and after the guilds. Although the mobility of apprentices was high and contracts were uncertain, no complaints arose from masters or guilds. Wages paid to these apprentices demonstrate that their labour made a gradually increasing contribution to the workshop from the start of their term. This enticed masters to take on apprentices and removed the need for contract enforcement. After the guilds were abolished, the number of apprenticed orphans in the crafts grew, suggesting that guilds previously hampered access to training. Additional data collected for regular (non-orphan) apprentices corroborates these findings.;2017;From orphan to artisan: apprenticeship careers and contract enforcement in The Netherlands before and after the guild abolition;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Scott, Peter M.; WALKER, JAMES T.";This article examines the impacts of British government ?stop-go? policy on domestic sales of consumer durables over the period 1952?65, via hire purchase restrictions and punitive Purchase Tax rates. Our analysis includes a general review of contemporary evidence regarding the impacts of these measures, a more detailed study of the television sector, and time-series econometric analysis for both televisions and a representative high-ticket labour-saving consumer durable: washing machines. We find that the restrictions had devastating impacts on Britain's consumer durables industries, preventing firms from fully exploiting economies of scale, reducing output growth and international competitiveness, and eroding industrial relations. Government officials were aware of these problems, but considered them a price worth paying to facilitate moves towards sterling convertibility and the re-establishment of the City as a leading financial and trading centre.;2017;The impact of ‘stop-go’ demand management policy on Britain's consumer durables industries, 1952–65;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Siodla, James;The 1906 San Francisco fire, which destroyed thousands of buildings, provided a blank canvas upon which to reshape the city. After reconstruction, and at a time of immense growth in the city, developers shifted land out of residential uses and into nonresidential uses in burned areas relative to unburned areas. They facilitated this transition by rebuilding far fewer single-family dwellings compared to other types of housing, which suggests that houses inhibited the conversion of land to nonresidential uses before the fire. Aside from these broad effects, the fire also released new economic potential in areas that had shown little indication of shifting into nonresidential land uses before 1906, thereby creating new clusters of business activity. These impacts of the fire are still evident today—in roughly the same magnitudes and places—which suggests that the economic benefits realized upon reconstruction continue to drive the city's land-use patterns.;2017;Clean slate: Land-use changes in San Francisco after the 1906 disaster;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Skogstad, Karl;This paper examines the relative effectiveness of different vessels used as convoy escorts in the North Atlantic by the Allied navies during the Second World War. A data set is created that matches convoy movements to German U-boat locations in order to examine the escort composition and the number of merchant ships lost when an engagement occurred. I find that larger escort vessels, such as destroyers and frigates, were between 1.4 and 2.25 more effective than smaller escort vessels, such as corvettes, at preventing the loss of a merchant ship. As an application of these results, I examine the cost faced by the Allies from Canada failing to develop domestic naval manufacturing capabilities prior to World War II. By constructing a counterfactual scenario, I find that developing a Canadian domestic shipbuilding industry would have given the Allies a net benefit of 23.2 million 1940 Canadian dollars.;2017;The effectiveness of Canada's navy on escort duty;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Straumann, Tobias; Kugler, Peter; Weber, Florian";According to conventional wisdom, the fall of the Swedish currency in September 1931 was caused by the sterling crisis. This article shows that the road towards devaluation began earlier and that financial linkages with Germany proved to be more important than Sweden's economic and monetary relations with Great Britain. It all started in late 1929 when the Swedish financier Ivar Kreuger gave a loan to the German government in exchange for the match monopoly, thus tying his business ventures to Germany's solvency. In addition, a part of this loan was financed by large US dollar credits from the two largest Swedish banks that, in turn, accumulated a sizeable foreign short-term deficit. When in June 1931 the German fiscal crisis began to escalate, international investors ceased to consider Sweden a safe haven because they knew about the linkages between the German government, Kreuger, and the Swedish banking system. This downgrading, in combination with the foreign short-term deficit of the banking sector, proved lethal for the reserve position of the Swedish central bank, once the international liquidity crisis in mid-July 1931 erupted. The sterling crisis only put the final nail in the coffin.;2017;How the German crisis of 1931 swept across Europe: a comparative view from Stockholm†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

They continue to ignore the evidence presented in part II of Fertility, class and gender, summarized in my reply to their original article, that the design of the model is both conceptually flawed and methodologically incoherent. It is reaffirmed that therefore its statistical results should be treated with all due scepticism in terms of their historical significance and capacity to inform us about the relationship between changing reproductive behaviour and the complexities of social class relations. Alternative approaches, liberated from the simplifying limitations of the professional model, are required to advance our understanding of the relationship between fertility change and social class.;2017;Rebuttal to Barnes and Guinnane;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Thomadakis, Stavros; Gounopoulos, Dimitrios; Nounis, Christos; Riginos, Michalis";The establishment and growth of the Greek stock market were coincident with development episodes, financial upheavals, and geographic expansions of the country's economy over the period 1880?1940. This article explores the growth of the Athens Stock Exchange through new listings and initial public offerings (IPOs) in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. We examine changes in exchange governance and listing requirements. On a theme not addressed before, we find that simple listings were far more numerous than actual IPOs. IPOs in Greece remained unregulated throughout the period. Their under-pricing became pronounced in the later parts of the period, especially the 1920s. The study presents data on ?quasi-IPOs? (that is, capital increases shortly after listing) and shows that they offer a more accurate assessment of the demand for the financing of listing firms in an emerging market. Robust evidence is presented to show that as the Exchange developed it also underwent a change in character, becoming more oriented to the domestic market and catering to smaller firms in domestic manufacturing in the post-First World War era that marked the end of early globalization.;2017;Innovation and upheaval: early growth in Greek capital market listings and IPOs from 1880 to the Second World War in the Athens Stock Exchange†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Tollnek, Franziska; Baten, Jörg";Did the early development of skills and numerical abilities occur primarily in urban centres and among the elite groups of society? This study assesses the human capital of different occupational groups in the early modern period and partially confirms this finding: skilled and professional groups had higher levels of numeracy and literacy than persons in unskilled occupations. However, there was another large group that developed substantial human capital and represented around one-third of the total population: farmers. By analysing numeracy and literacy evidence from six countries in Europe and Latin America, we argue that farmers contributed significantly to the formation of human capital and, consequently, to modern economic growth.;2017;Farmers at the heart of the ‘human capital revolution’?

van Nederveen Meerkerk, Elise;Many dependency theorists as well as economic historians have contended that nineteenth-century imperial policies and economic globalization de-industrialized the global ?periphery?. European metropoles extracted raw materials and tropical commodities from their overseas territories, and in turn indigenous consumers bought their industrial products, textiles in particular. This article investigates three of the assumptions of Ricardian trade theory that are often behind the de-industrialization narrative. In this article it is argued that, at least for colonial Java's textile industry, these assumptions should be reconsidered. Adverse trade policies imposed by the Dutch and a prolonged terms-of-trade boom in favour of primary commodities make colonial Java a unique case for exploring the merits of the de-industrialization thesis. Here it is demonstrated that Javanese households resourcefully responded to changing market circumstances, in the first place by flexible allocation of female labour. Moreover, indigenous textile producers specialized in certain niches that catered for local demand. Because of these factors, local textile production in Java appears to have been much more resilient than most of the historical literature suggests. These findings not only shed new light on the social and economic history of colonial Indonesia, but also contribute to the recent literature on alternative, labour-intensive paths of industrialization in the non-western world.;2017;Challenging the de-industrialization thesis: gender and indigenous textile production in Java under Dutch colonial rule, c. 1830–1920;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"van Rossem, Tina; Deboosere, Patrick; Devos, Isabelle";In this article, we reconstruct the sex- and age-specific mortality rates for the 25 largest Belgian cities at the turn of the twentieth century, and we explore their relationship with industrialization. Whereas previous research has focused mainly on the general level of industrial employment, we make a distinction between two production systems: cottage work (i.e., employment at home) and regular industrial production (i.e., centralized employment). Our linear regression models suggest that cities oriented toward cottage industry were more lethal than those oriented toward regular industry. Cities where a substantial percentage of the labor force was engaged in cottage work suffered high mortality rates, which confirms contemporary claims that in Belgium the cottage industry was “the most murderous of all industries.” Regular industrial employment, on the other hand, appears to have been less harmful for men and women alike, both young and old. We do observe, however, a detrimental effect from female regular industrial employment on infant and child mortality. Using contemporary government reports and sociological works, we were able to gain insights into the possible pathways that created these large health discrepancies between production systems. We argue that the health hazards encountered by cottage workers were due to the absence of labor and wage regulations and to the lack of health and safety standards in cottage work. In many sectors of the regular industry—and in heavy industry in particular—numerous regulations of this type had already been enforced by emerging labor union organizations, resulting in improvements in working conditions and higher wages. Furthermore, regular heavy industry seems to have attracted the healthiest workers.;2017;Death at work?

"Vasta, Michelangelo; Drago, Carlo; Ricciuti, Roberto; Rinaldi, Alberto";Until the banking reform in 1936, banks and industrial companies in Italy were strongly intertwined (both in terms of ownership and interlocking directorates). Using Imita.db—a large dataset containing data on over 300,000 directors of Italian joint-stock companies—this paper analyzes what would have happened to the Italian corporate network in the years 1913, 1921, 1927 and 1936 if the German-type universal banks and their directors would have not been there. Our test shows that new centers of the system would have emerged (financial, electricity, and phone companies), confirming the interconnected nature of the Italian capitalism. We also analyze two industries (textiles and iron and steel) characterized by different labor-to-capital intensities to check for sectoral differences. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find that local banks were important in funding both industries.;2017;Reassessing the bank–industry relationship in Italy, 1913–1936: a counterfactual analysis;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Volckart, Oliver;Using new sources, this article examines how in the years around 1550 Charles V and the imperial estates came close to creating a common currency for the Holy Roman Empire. The article analyses whose interests prevailed in the negotiations and how, despite the resistance of some important actors, the Imperial diet of 1551 was able to unanimously agree on the currency bill. It also analyses why the common currency still failed: This was the case because of the desire of many princes to ease the repayment of their debts by establishing a bimetallic currency, and even more importantly because of Charles V's attempt to weaken the Elector of Saxony by undervaluing the taler. In this, Charles exploited the diet's implicit ex-ante agreement with him to set the rates at which old money was allowed to continue in circulation. His manipulations provoked resistance, raised the costs of implementing the common currency, and caused its failure.;2017;Power politics and princely debts: why Germany's common currency failed, 1549–56†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Vonyó, Tamás;This article reconsiders the relative growth performance of centrally planned economies in the broader context of postwar growth in Europe. It reports a new dataset of revised estimates for investment rates in eastern European countries between 1950 and 1989. Complemented with data on other growth determinants, this evidence is used to re-evaluate the socialist growth record in a conditional convergence framework with a panel of 24 European countries. After controlling for relative backwardness, investment rates, and improvements in human capital, the findings show that centrally planned economies underperformed due to their relative inefficiency only after the postwar golden age. In the 1950s and 1960s, eastern Europe was falling behind mainly due to relatively low levels of investment and weak reconstruction dynamics. Both are explained, in part, by the lack of labour-supply flexibility that, in turn, resulted from the comparatively much larger negative impact of the war on population growth in eastern Europe.;2017;War and socialism: why eastern Europe fell behind between 1950 and 1989†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Waldenström, Daniel;This study uses new data on Swedish national wealth over the last two hundred years to examine whether the patterns in wealth-income ratios found by Piketty and Zucman ( extend to small and less developed economies. The findings reveal both similarities and differences. During the industrialization era, Sweden's domestic wealth was relatively low because of low saving rates and instead foreign capital imports became important. Twentieth-century trends and levels are more similar, but in Sweden government wealth grew more important, not least through its relatively large public pension system. Overall, the findings suggest that initial conditions and economic and political institutions matter for the structure and evolution of national wealth.;2017;Wealth-Income Ratios in a Small, Developing Economy: Sweden, 1810–2014;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Ward, Zachary;"A key feature of migration in the late 19th and early 20th century is that many migrants returned to Europe after a few years in the United States. A common view is that most temporary migrants planned, upon entry, to eventually return home, yet there is little direct evidence to support this claim. I collect the first dataset on migrants' intentions to stay or return home from Ellis Island arrival records between 1917 and 1924. I find that fewer migrants planned to return home than actually did; many migrants, especially from Eastern and Southern Europe, left the United States unexpectedly. The high rate of unplanned returns implies that the first few years after arrival were more difficult than expected. However, this high rate of unexpected returns lowered after the 1920s migration quotas, suggesting improved outcomes for those lucky enough to enter.";2017;Birds of passage: Return migration, self-selection and immigration quotas;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The article discusses wealth distribution by location and social status, and shows how privileged groups used diplomatic, ecclesiastical, and military rank to avoid the hearth tax, while ordinary householders turned to doorstep opposition, especially in the outer and poorer suburbs, in expressing their hostility towards the heath tax. The article demonstrates that in Metropolitan London the assessment and collection of the hearth tax depended not only upon the enforcement of the parliamentary legislation, but also upon negotiation and give-and-take between tax collectors and tax payers, sometimes in consultation with the Crown. As a result the hearth tax failed to fill the king's purse, was unpopular in the capital and in the country, and created onerous work for both auditors and hearth tax collectors, which contributed to the short life of the hearth tax (1662?89).";2017;The unpopularity of the hearth tax and the social geography of London in 1666;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Watts, D. C. H.;There is growing interest in the ways in which, and the values according to which, economic activity is undertaken. For instance, mutual ownership has been identified as one means of helping to ?redeem? capitalism. This article engages with such issues by examining aspects of the behaviour of consumer cooperative societies in Scotland from the 1870s to the 1960s. It starts by discussing whether cooperatives represent a means of conceptualizing and undertaking economic activity that provides an alternative to the paradigm of investor-led (neo)liberal capitalism. From this, and an outline history of consumer cooperatives in Scotland, it identifies two variables?dividend on purchases and funds for education?as proxies for the values underpinning cooperatives? economic behaviour. Analysis of these variables indicates the existence of distinct cultures of cooperation, notably in the Glasgow and Edinburgh areas. The article concludes by offering two ?lessons from history? for those interested in alternative economic networks. The first is that cooperation can, and has, conceptualized and sustained an alternative to the dominant (neo)liberal economic paradigm. The second is that the scaling-up of such voluntaristic economic thought and behaviour is unlikely to present a macro-level challenge to it.;2017;Building an alternative economic network?

Yuchtman, Noam;A traditional education system, based on the Confucian classics, was a pillar of imperial China's social structure for centuries, preparing elites for a series of highly competitive exams conferring gentry status and civil service positions. Reformers in late imperial China called for the modernization of educational institutions, seeing in Western education the skills necessary to develop China's economy. In the late 19th century, the traditional education system was joined by a “modern”, Western track, which offered teaching in science, math, social science, law, and engineering. In this paper, early 20th century employee records from the Tianjin-Pukou Railroad are analyzed to identify differences in labor market outcomes associated with study in the traditional and modern educational systems. The employee records reveal that modern and traditional education were both associated with wage premiums, but that these were significantly larger for individuals trained at high levels in the modern system, especially those trained in engineering. Individuals trained in the traditional system worked disproportionately in the clerical department of the railroad, while those with modern education were more often in managerial and technical roles. Qualitative and quantitative evidence suggests that these results are not driven by sorting into educational institutions according to ability. These findings indicate that beyond years of schooling, the content of schooling can play an important role in the process of economic development.;2017;Teaching to the tests: An economic analysis of traditional and modern education in late imperial and republican China;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The entry barriers, which enabled gedik markets to exist in the first place, also limited their use for growth-promoting purposes and thus set them apart from similar financial instruments that emerged in the West.

Ahnland, Lars;This study demonstrates a long-run relationship between inequality and the bank debt to GDP ratio in Sweden in 1919–2012. The findings suggest that much of the impact of the top income share on the debt ratio comes from changes in the profit share. Earlier research claims that the rich, via the banks, have lent their savings to the poor as a substitute for wage gains, but this description seems ill-suited for Sweden. An alternative explanation is that banks consider profits to be an indicator of the safety of a loan.

Albers, Thilo N. H.;Based on a novel dataset of about 1150 time series, this study provides monthly economic activity estimates for 28 countries during the Great Depression. Due to their high frequency, the indices reveal that steady growth was far from universal even in the second half of the 1920s. Monetary and financial instability, agricultural crises, and labor conflict continued to plague economies around the globe. The high frequency of the data also facilitates a global comparison of the severity of the Great Depression along two dimensions: the cumulative loss and duration. The variation along these two dimensions across and within countries indicates a rising importance of the trade channel at the later stages of the crisis.

"Alexander, Patrick D.; Keay, Ian";In this paper, we study the impact of Canada’s adoption of protectionist trade policy in 1879 on Canadian welfare. Under the National Policy, the Canadian average weighted tariff increased from 14% to 21%. The conventional view is that this was a distortionary policy that negatively affected Canadian welfare. We argue that this view is incomplete because it ignores general equilibrium effects. Using a multi-industry general equilibrium model with differentiated goods, we show that tariffs’ impact on welfare can potentially be positive, even for small open economies, due to their impact on domestic terms of trade and government revenues. We apply these theoretical insights in a reassessment of the static impact that the National Policy had on Canadian welfare in 1879, using newly compiled granular trade and production data, and newly estimated historically contemporaneous import demand elasticities. Our results suggest that, although a multilateral move to free trade would have resulted in the best welfare outcome for Canadians, the National Policy’s tariff increases actually improved Canadian welfare by approximately 0.15% of GDP in 1879 – an amount equivalent to approximately $2.3 billion 2016 USD.;2018;A general equilibrium analysis of Canada’s national policy;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Infant arrivals had a positive wage gap relative to natives, in contrast to a negative gap for teenage arrivals.

Allen, Robert C.;The invention of the power loom was a response to the increase in supply of yarn in the 1780s. This led to an expansion of handloom weaving and a rise in earnings in the 1790s, thereby, creating the “golden age”. The high earnings increased the profitability of developing the power loom by raising the value of the labour that it saved. Consequently, less efficient—hence, cheaper to develop—power looms could be brought into commercial use than would have been the case had the golden age not occurred.

We employ a Mincerian regression approach and find a positive and statistically significant association between skills and average earnings. Although we cannot reliably assess causality in the observed relationship, these findings are robust to conditioning on household composition, job characteristics, and place of residence. Nonetheless, further testing indicates that the earnings gradient associated with literacy is driven mainly by unobservable variables (e.g., ability, family background) that explain both the worker's acquisition of this skill and his earnings. The estimated associations are stronger for urban than for rural workers and are highly heterogeneous across activity sectors. Our analysis reveals that workers with higher skills were not only better remunerated in their main occupation but also more likely to diversify their earnings through “by-employment”. Finally, quantile regression analysis indicates that earnings disparities—between workers with different skills—were much smaller at the lower than the upper end of the earnings distribution. This evidence suggests that, in pre-industrial Castile, human capital may have contributed to inequality of earnings.;2018;Human capital and earnings in eighteenth-century Castile;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Alvarez-Nogal, Carlos; Chamley, Christophe";In the fragmented geographical, fiscal, and financial state inherited by Philip II of Spain, while the public debt reached an unprecedented level (50?60 per cent of GDP), the critical refinancing of unfunded asientos into funded juros was operated by merchant-bankers who signed the asientos. This process is illustrated, using abundant archival documentation, by an asiento with the Maluenda brothers in 1595, which provided the Crown with steady monthly cash payments for a year with options to sell juros for two-thirds of the credit, and a monthly rate of 1 per cent on the interim balance. Other examples are provided.;2018;Refinancing short-term debt with a fixed monthly interest rate into funded juros under Philip II: an asiento with the Maluenda brothers;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Amaral, Luciano;Until the Second World War the Bank of Portugal (BoP) was a long way from possessing the features normally associated with a central bank. It was still a commercial bank, albeit one that had acquired some central bank functions. The war period was decisive in removing this ambiguity. The change was caused mostly by an unusually large influx of international means of payment (gold and foreign exchange) as a consequence of Portugal's neutrality during the war. However, all of this happened during a very troubled period for the BoP, thanks to the collapse of the gold-exchange standard. The BoP adapted quickly to the new environment of discretion, government interference, and nationalism, although in a relatively original way: it followed the trend but at the same time retained certain features of a central bank still committed to gold standard principles. The two essential objectives of the BoP were to keep the value of the Portuguese currency stable and to keep interest rates low in order to encourage economic growth. The bank was successful on both counts during the war and the postwar period using a series of non-conventional instruments.;2018;A monetary plethora and what to do with it: the Bank of Portugal during the Second World War and the postwar period (1931–60);The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Anderson, Peter;"Studies in anthropometrics continue to find a wage-height premium in modern economies despite most productivity not contingent on physical strength. These authors argue that height is a proxy for cognitive and non-cognitive abilities, which earns the positive return. In this paper, I collected data on over 2,200 English and Welsh railwaymen from staff ledgers to test if the same relationship held during the Victorian and Edwardian period. Using an OLS model, it is found that a wage-height premium existed. Applying the same model to different subgroups of railwaymen, it was found that the premium only accrued to taller men working in skilled grades that required a higher cognitive and non-cognitive skill to strength ratio. No such premium existed in the physically taxing entry-level railway grades. A probit regression finds that taller Great Western signalmen working in Wales did not have a lower probability of receiving a fine upon committing an infraction; a finding that contradicts heightism as an explanation of the wage-height premium. I conclude that taller railwaymen benefited because height indirectly measured their cognitive and non-cognitive abilities, not their strength.";2018;‘Tall and lithe’–The wage-height premium in the Victorian and Edwardian British railway industry;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Arthi, Vellore;I find that childhood exposure to the Dust Bowl, an environmental shock to health and income, adversely impacted later-life human capital—especially when exposure was in utero—increasing poverty and disability rates, and decreasing fertility and college completion rates. The event's devastation of agriculture, however, had the beneficial effect of increasing high school completion, likely by pushing children who otherwise might have worked on the farm into secondary schooling. Lastly, New Deal spending helped remediate Dust Bowl damage, suggesting that timely and substantial policy interventions can aid in human recovery from natural disasters.;2018;“The Dust Was Long in Settling”: Human Capital and the Lasting Impact of the American Dust Bowl;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Badia-Miró, Marc; Carreras-Marín, Anna; Meissner, Christopher M.";"Regional trade in South America since independence has long been much smaller than would be expected if geography were the only constraint on trade. Several potential explanations exist, including low technological and demand complementarities; low productivity; and high natural and policy barriers to trade. Focusing on the latter explanations, policy makers have long advocated a South American/Southern Cone Free Trade Area?proposed as early as 1889. Would reductions in trade costs have been sufficient to raise trade significantly, or was trade low for other reasons? We study bilateral trade between 1910 and 1950, when large external shocks altered global supply and demand. These shocks help us show that intra-regional trade could have been boosted by reductions in trade costs. Trade among Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, and Peru could have benefited from more benign trade policies or better infrastructure. Regional trade in textiles, which took off from the 1930s, supports our argument that trade improved when trade costs fell.";2018;Geography, policy, or productivity?

"Bailey, Roy E.; Hatton, Timothy J.; Inwood, Kris";In nineteenth century Britain atmospheric pollution from coal-fired industrialization was on the order of 50 times higher than today. We examine the effects of these emissions on child development by analysing the heights on enlistment during WWI of men born in England and Wales in the 1890s. We find a strong negative relationship between adult heights and the coal intensity of the districts in which these men were observed as children in the 1901 census. The subsequent decline in atmospheric pollution likely contributed to the long-term improvement in health and increase in height.;2018;Atmospheric Pollution, Health, and Height in Late Nineteenth Century Britain;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Ballaux, Bart; BLONDÉ, BRUNO";Though there is a consensus that transport plays a central role in economic development, for the period before the eighteenth century there is a lack of strategic information for assessing the importance of road transport productivity changes in economic development. Transport prices in particular are crucial missing pieces of the puzzle. Sources rarely reveal information that meets the standards of reliable price history. However, it is possible to create a reliable transport price series on the basis of the transport of millstones to ducal mills in Brabant. Assessing the impact of the ?transport productivity changes? that can be inferred from this transport price series is a hazardous exercise. Moreover, as Masschaele has observed, land transport prices closely match general agricultural price trends. Land transport was essentially an agricultural service, determined both by cost (especially horse provender) and income effects. Transport price inflation was not demand-led. However, while transport did not impede urbanization and economic growth, conversely, in sixteenth-century Brabant?a highly urbanized region that experienced considerable growth in the volume of land transport?no significant land transport productivity gains were achieved.;2018;Road transport productivity in the sixteenth-century Low Countries: the case of Brabant, 1450–1650†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Becuwe, Stéphane; Blancheton, Bertrand; Meissner, Christopher M.";We study economic performance in France 1836–1938 through the prism of international trade. Using a new database of disaggregated exports, we document that French revealed comparative advantage moved from traditional to new manufactures and some non-manufactured goods. A strong diversification of exports begins in 1860 which decelerates from 1880. GDP per capita is a stronger determinant of diversification than trade barriers. Both variables have been highlighted in recent studies of export diversification covering the late 20th century. France followed a very common trajectory supporting the view that French economic performance was not as abnormal as the early literature maintained.;2018;Stages of diversification: France, 1836–1938;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Beestermöller, Matthias; Rauch, Ferdinand";We study trade in Europe after the fall of the Iron Curtain, and show that the countries of the former Austro-Hungarian monarchy trade significantly more with one another after 1989 than predicted by a standard gravity model. Cultural trading capital, established under Habsburg rule and maintained in the period of the Iron Curtain, seems to have survived over four decades of separation and gives an initial boost to trade. This surplus trade disappeared rapidly after 1990 as countries rearranged themselves with the new geopolitical circumstances.

While such a relationship between these two variables hardly existed during the second half of the nineteenth century, this link increased significantly between 1910 and 1970, although this trend was abruptly interrupted by the Civil War and the autarkic period that followed. The intensity of this relationship decreased in the 1970s, a process that continued during the 1980s. Our findings also stress that agglomeration economies were stronger in medium-size districts, especially from 1960 onwards.;2018;Tracing the Evolution of Agglomeration Economies: Spain, 1860–1991;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Beltrán Tapia, Francisco J.; Martínez-Galarraga, Julio";This article contributes to the debate on institutions and economic development by examining the historical link between land access inequality and education. Using information from the 464 districts existent in mid-19th century Spain, this paper confirms that there is a negative relationship between the fraction of farm labourers and male literacy rates. This result does not disappear when a large set of potential confounding factors are included in the analysis. The use of the Reconquest as a quasi-natural experiment allows us to rule out further concerns about potential endogeneity. In addition, controlling for different sources of spatial dependence does not explain away this result either. By analysing the rural–urban divide and the gender-specific information on the number of schools and teachers, as well as schooling enrolment rates, this paper also explores the mechanisms behind the observed relationship. As well as supply factors, our results show that demand effects also played a significant role in explaining the negative impact of inequality on education.;2018;Inequality and education in pre-industrial economies: Evidence from Spain;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Bengtsson, Erik; Missiaia, Anna; Olsson, Mats; Svensson, Patrick";This article examines the evolution of wealth inequality in Sweden from 1750 to 1900, contributing both to the debate on early modern and modern inequality and to the general debate on the pattern of inequality during industrialization. The pre-industrial period (1750?1850) is for the first time examined for Sweden at the national level. The study uses a random sample of probate inventories from urban and rural areas across the country, adjusted for age and social class. Estimates are provided for the years 1750, 1800, 1850, and 1900. The results show a gradual growth in inequality as early as the mid-eighteenth century, with the sharpest rise in the late nineteenth century. Whereas the early growth in inequality was connected to changes in the countryside and in agriculture, the later growth was related to industrialization encompassing both compositional effects and strong wealth accumulation among the richest. The level of inequality in Sweden in 1750 was lower than for other western European countries, but by 1900 Sweden was just as unequal.;2018;Wealth inequality in Sweden, 1750–1900†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Bengtsson, Erik; Waldenström, Daniel";This article studies the long-run relationship between the capital share in national income and top personal income shares. Using a newly constructed historical cross-country database on capital shares and top income data, we find evidence on a strong, positive link that has grown stronger over the past century. The connection is stronger in Anglo-Saxon countries, in the very top of the distribution, when top capital incomes predominate, when using distributed top national income shares, and when considering gross of depreciation capital shares. Out of-sample predictions of top shares using capital shares indicates several cases of over- or underestimation.;2018;Capital Shares and Income Inequality: Evidence from the Long Run;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Blum, Matthias; Krauss, Karl-Peter";Age-heaping-based numeracy indicators have served as valuable tools to derive basic human capital estimates, especially for periods where other indicators are unavailable. However, the accuracy of individual age statements usually remains unknown, and due to the lack of precise information it can only be assumed that excessive occurrence of multiples of five in age distributions reflects inferior numerical skills. This article addresses this lacuna by identifying 162 individuals in two independent data sources: self-reported age statements and independently kept records which are based on family heritage books and church registers. This method makes it possible to identify individual misreporting and the degree of accuracy of each individual. Findings show that not everyone who reported a multiple of five was reporting an incorrect age, nor was it the case that everyone who reported an age that was not a multiple of five was reporting an accurate age. The empirical analysis shows that the commonly used binary numeracy indicator is correlated with the observed degree of accuracy in age statements, and that a more sophisticated occupational background reduces this inaccuracy. These results tentatively suggest that the commonly used binary indicator measuring age heaping is a valuable proxy for numerical skills and occupational background in a population.;2018;Age heaping and numeracy: looking behind the curtain;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

We find that both refugee and nonrefugee passengers were positively selected, but nonrefugees were even more so, suggesting it was predominantly the European elite who escaped the Holocaust during this period. In spite of the unique circumstances of this historical setting, this episode of migration displays well-known selection features: both refugees and nonrefugees are positively selected, and earlier passengers are more positively selected than later passengers, and economic barriers to migration apply.;2018;Escaping Europe: health and human capital of Holocaust refugees1;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Boal, William M.;Why did coal mining remain so dangerous in the early twentieth century? Observers blamed miners for neglecting safety in their haste to load coal, for which they were paid on piece. Using a panel of about 500 coal mines, the elasticity of fatalities with respect to speed or intensity of work is estimated to be about one-half, implying a marginal cost of a statistical life to miners of about $400 thousand in 1921 dollars. This likely exceeded their value of a statistical life, so preventing accidents was expensive for miners. However, the union reduced fatalities with little effect on work intensity.;2018;Work intensity and worker safety in early twentieth-century coal mining;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Boele, Anita; Moor, T. de";This article investigates the causes of the remarkable growth in and specialization of elderly care institutions in the Netherlands during the early modern period, and relates these developments to a number of major changes in the household formation process, which had both a direct and an indirect impact on the need for elderly care in general and on the relationships between the elderly and next of kin (partners, children, and other family members). Some specific features of the specialization in care, such as the care provisions for couples, point towards an underlying change in these relationships, which may have resulted from a combination of factors such as neolocality, high marriage ages for both men and women, and, related to this, the small spousal age gap and large numbers of singles. In the typical nuclear household society of early modern Holland, even when children lived close enough and were financially capable to provide help, parents often still relied on extra-familial elderly care provisions. This article also argues that this practice was embedded in a persistent moral culture accentuating independence, agency, self-help, investment in the younger generation, and community, instead of putting family responsibilities first.;2018;‘Because family and friends got easily weary of taking care’: a new perspective on the specialization in the elderly care sector in early modern Holland;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

These taxes together with the social status information of each individual allow setting fiscal progressivity and an approach to human capital. The results show how the levels of inequality were higher in preindustrial periods. However, industrialization with a deskilling occupational process and the emergence of a new working class reinforced the socioeconomic disparity due to the effects of proletarianization.;2018;Estimating long-term socioeconomic inequality in southern Europe: The Barcelona area, 1481–1880;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Broadberry, Stephen N.; Campbell, Bruce M.

His income-based estimates start with the daily real wages of adult males and assume that days worked per year were constant. Those advanced in British economic growth make no such assumption and instead are built up from the output side. They correlate better with population trends and are consistent with an economy slowly growing and becoming richer. Clark's denial that such growth occurred, his assertion that substantially more land must have been under arable cultivation, his belief that conditions of full employment invariably prevailed in the countryside at harvest time, his concern that the wage bill would have exceeded the value of output in British economic growth, his refusal to consider the possibility that the working year was of variable length, and his assertion that output per acre must have been equalized across arable and pasture are all shown to be figments of his ?Malthus delusion?.;2018;Clark's Malthus delusion: response to ‘Farming in England 1200–1800’;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Brown, John C.; Guinnane, Timothy W.";Abstract During most of the nineteenth century, Bavaria was notorious for infant mortality rates that were among the highest in Europe. After 1870, infant mortality in Bavaria began a sustained decline. This decline, which was impressive in urban areas, was even more dramatic in Bavaria's capital, Munich. From a peak of 40 deaths per 100 births in the 1860s, infant mortality had fallen two-thirds by 1914. This article examines the causes of infant mortality in rural and urban districts of Bavaria from 1880 to 1910 and in Munich from 1825 up to shortly before the First World War. In rural Bavaria, structural change in agriculture lowered infant mortality, even as stark differences in infant survival driven by income gaps and deficient infant care remained. In urban areas, high fertility was strongly associated with high infant mortality. Individual-level data from Munich reveal that infant care, fertility, and incomes mattered. Even prior to industrialization, occupational status influenced infant survival. Munich's growth into a leading industrial centre after 1875 apparently widened the gap between rich and poor. Families at the top of the occupational distribution and couples able to acquire real property saw the steepest declines in infant mortality. The poorest one-third without property saw little improvement.;2018;Infant mortality decline in rural and urban Bavaria: fertility, economic transformation, infant care, and inequality in Bavaria and Munich, 1825–1910†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Cagé, Julia; Gadenne, Lucie";This article examines the impact of trade liberalization on government revenues. Using a new dataset on tax revenues for 130 countries between 1792 and 2006, we identify ninety-nine episodes of trade liberalization defined as a large fall in trade tax revenues not accompanied by a decrease in trade. Seven took place before World War One, seven in the interwar period, eighteen in the Bretton Woods period and the remainder after 1970. We examine the extent to which countries were able to recover the tax revenues lost by liberalizing trade by using other sources of revenue. We find that historical (pre-1970) trade liberalization episodes were unlikely to be accompanied by decreases in tax revenues, especially during the Bretton Woods era. In the recent period however, over 40% of the developing countries in our sample experience a fall in total tax revenues that lasts more than ten years after an episode of trade liberalization. Overall, trade liberalization led to larger and longer-lived declines in tax revenues in developing countries since 1970 than in today’s rich countries in the 19th and 20th centuries. Results are similar when we consider government expenditures, suggesting decreases in trade tax revenues negatively affect governments’ capacity to provide public services in many developing countries.;2018;Tax revenues and the fiscal cost of trade liberalization, 1792–2006;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Contemporary press reporting from the London Stock Exchange is used to ascertain what market participants thought was causing the largest movements on the market. The vast majority of large movements were attributed by the press to geopolitical, monetary, railway-sector, and financial-crisis news.

We find that stock market liquidity trended upwards but bond market liquidity did not increase over the sample period. Stock market liquidity during our sample period was partially influenced by the bond market, rather than fluctuations in economic output. In our analysis of the cross-sectional determinants of individual stock liquidity, we find that firm size and the number of issued shares were important determinants of liquidity.  Finally, we find little evidence of an illiquidity premium, which is consistent with the view that investors did not price liquidity in this nascent market.;2018;The liquidity of the London capital markets, 1825–70†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Castenbrandt, Helene;"In this article national statistics from Swedish sickness funds are analysed from 1892 to 1954. The study is intended to provide better knowledge of changes in sickness claims, and to contribute to the discussion of morbidity trends. National statistics on sickness benefits are available from 1892, and are studied until the introduction of mandatory health insurance in 1955. Membership of Swedish sickness funds increased more than tenfold between 1900 and 1950. Just a small portion of members were women in 1900; however, women constituted the majority of members by 1941. There was a gender difference in morbidity, but this variation was not consistent over time. Before 1935 men had more but shorter sickness episodes; however, after 1935 women had significantly higher sickness rates. The law in 1931 meant that the recruitment of members was widened and compensation for longer periods of illness was made possible. The continuous increase in sick days can be partly explained by legislative changes; however, the increase in the period 1910?32 cannot. The study thereby highlights the importance of incorporating legislative changes into the interpretation. This increased understanding of trends in sick leave provides a sound basis for extending the study to the analysis of individual-level data.";2018;Trends in morbidity: national statistics on sickness claims among the working population in Sweden, 1892–1954;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
CERRETANO, VALERIO;Despite the considerable attention granted to the history of international business, we still have a limited knowledge of the historical impact of multinationals on host economies. This article presents the case of the giant Italian rayon firm Snia Viscosa which was acquired by its direct rivals, Courtaulds in the UK and the German firm Glanzstoff, in 1927. Italian deflation which underpinned the return of the country to the gold standard between 1925 and 1927 and the parlous financial conditions of Snia Viscosa proved incentives in what seemed to be a fire sale investment. This investment mitigated the credit crunch and allowed Snia Viscosa to have access to foreign rayon expertise. Evidence suggests that the regime and economic nationalism exerted some pressure on foreign interests and were instrumental in the abandonment of plans intended to reduce Italian rayon output dramatically. One contribution of this article is its use of business history to illustrate how recessions can reshape foreign direct investment flows and the tensions that may arise between domestic business interests and foreign stakeholders during recessions. In addition, the history of Snia Viscosa shows the importance of foreign interests and multinationals in the long-term industrialization of Italy.;2018;Multinational business and host countries in times of crisis: Courtaulds, Glanzstoff, and Italy in the interwar period;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

In this paper we analyze to what extent state spending on primary education affected participation at general elections and votes for pro-nationalist parties. We combine census data on the composition of school funding with federal election data at the level of 199 constituencies in five-year intervals from 1886 to 1911. Panel estimates of models with constituency and time-fixed effects show that an increase in the share of central spending is positively related to the vote share for pro-nationalist parties. Results on voter turnout are weaker and less clear cut.

Clark, Gregory;"Estimates of English income in Broadberry et al.?s British economic growth, 1270?1870 are founded upon a fourfold growth of farm output, and output per farm worker, over this interval. This article shows, using four separate tests, that farm output growth must have been much more limited. The tests are, first, whether in 1300 there was enough work at harvest to employ all the labour force; second, whether the value of output per worker in agriculture was greater than the annual earnings of workers; third, whether the implied relative outputs per acre of arable versus pasture were reasonable; and fourth, whether a much shorter medieval work year was possible. An alternative index of farm output consistent with the labour supply, wages, and farm rents is derived. This shows much less growth during the period 1270?1800.

"Clay, Karen; Lewis, Joshua; Severnini, Edson";The 1918 Influenza Pandemic killed millions worldwide and hundreds of thousands in the United States. This article studies the impact of air pollution on pandemic mortality. The analysis combines a panel dataset on infant and all-age mortality with a novel measure of air pollution based on the burning of coal in a large sample of U.S. cities. We estimate that air pollution contributed significantly to pandemic mortality. Cities that used more coal experienced tens of thousands of excess deaths in 1918 relative to cities that used less coal with similar pre-pandemic socioeconomic conditions and baseline health. Factors related to poverty, public health, and the timing of onset also affected pandemic mortality. The findings support recent medical evidence on the link between air pollution and influenza infection, and suggest that poor air quality was an important cause of mortality during the pandemic.;2018;Pollution, Infectious Disease, and Mortality: Evidence from the 1918 Spanish Influenza Pandemic;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Costa, Leonor Freire; Rocha, Maria Manuela; Brito, Paulo B.";This article addresses the partial equilibrium functioning of the short-term credit market in eighteenth-century Lisbon and its response to massive gold inflows from Brazil. Gold inflows were a colonial rent, and thus a source of income and a financial asset that increased the liquidity supply in a credit market populated by both (direct) participants and non-participants in the colonial trade or in mining. As a source of income it would induce a positive upward pressure on interest rates, while as a financial asset it would lead to the opposite. A method is developed to extract interest rates from notarized personal credit, unbundling the aggregate and the idiosyncratic components of risk pricing. The results show that interest rates in Lisbon did not differ critically from those observed in other cities at the core of the premodern European economy, which were spared from devastation by the earthquake that struck Lisbon in 1755. A simple model relating the market interest rate series to gold stock variations finds that the liquidity channel dominated over the endowment channel, which explains the downward trend in interest rates up until 1757 when the interest rates were freely settled. Mild credit rationing may have been introduced by a 5 per cent ceiling on interest rates that was imposed after 1757.;2018;The alchemy of gold: interest rates, money stock, and credit in eighteenth-century Lisbon;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Crymble, Adam; Dennett, Adam; Hitchcock, Tim";Using a substantial set of vagrancy removal records for Middlesex (1777?86) giving details of the place of origin of some 11,500 individuals, and analysing these records using a five-variable gravity model of migration, this article addresses a simple question: from which parts of England did London draw its lower-class migrants in the late eighteenth century? It concludes, first, that industrializing areas of the north emerged as a competitor for potential migrants?contributing relatively fewer migrants than predicted by the model. Rising wage rates in these areas appear to explain this phenomenon. Second, it argues that migration from urban centres in the west midlands and parts of the West Country, including Bristol, Birmingham, and Worcester, was substantially higher than predicted, and that this is largely explained by falling wage rates and the evolution of an increasingly efficient travel network. Third, for the counties within about 130 kilometres of the capital, this article suggests that migration followed the pattern described in the current literature, with London drawing large numbers of local women in particular. It also argues that these short-distance migrants came from a uniquely wide number of parishes, suggesting a direct rural-to-urban path.;2018;Modelling regional imbalances in English plebeian migration to late eighteenth-century London†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Di Tullio, Matteo;This article addresses the question of how exogenous shocks led to economic redistribution at a local rural community level in the pre-industrial period, and how inequality can be limited (or not) by institutions and endogenous social structures within the community itself. This article presents a micro-analytical study conducted mainly on unpublished sources, focusing on a boundary area (the Geradadda) disputed by Milan and Venice during the long period of the Italian Wars (1494?1559) in a broad European perspective. To understand the impact of wars, the management of local commons and communal assets is analysed in the more general context of the management of local finances. This research shows how local communities organized cooperative behaviours for the defence of local resources, developing innovative credit systems and encouraging a process of redistribution. Before other important factors?such as the distribution of wealth or of local political and social power?cooperation between social groups and the role played by elites were the keystones to limiting the increase in inequality.;2018;Cooperating in time of crisis: war, commons, and inequality in Renaissance Lombardy;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Dimitruk, Kara;This paper provides evidence that the Glorious Revolution removed political barriers to changing property rights in seventeenth century England. I study parliament’s passage of estate bills, a legislation that broke restrictions on land use and made up most of parliament’s legislative output from 1660 to 1702. Using a new dataset on estate bills, I first document that the sudden closure (prorogation) of parliament by the monarch caused bills to fail. Probit and OLS estimates show estate bills were 19 percentage points more likely to fail in these sessions. Second, I show conflict delaying revenue bills and conflict with the monarch’s interests made sudden prorogations more likely before the Glorious Revolution. Political and constitutional changes with the Glorious Revolution were thus important for England’s economic development. They improved parliament’s provision of legislation that made property rights more flexible to changing economic opportunities throughout the preindustrial era.;2018;“I Intend Therefore to Prorogue”: the effects of political conflict and the Glorious Revolution in parliament, 1660–1702;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"DOMENECH, JORDI; Herreros, Francisco";This article studies the impact of insecure property rights on the behaviour of owners of land before the Spanish Civil War. The theoretical literature on land reform argues that legal threats to the status quo determine agrarian organization, with owners selling land and moving to other asset classes or engaging in large-scale substitution of sharecroppers and tenants with wage labourers. This study, which uses municipal data on tenant evictions in Catalonia in 1934?5, does not find that uncertainty over property rights in the 1930s meant that owners tried to substitute tenants with wage labourers, especially in the case of the controversial rabassa morta contracts on vineyards. Here it is argued that after 40 years of organizational adjustment to shocks related to phylloxera infestations, legal changes, urbanization, and changes in relative prices, by the 1930s the margin for adjustment was small.;2018;Land reform and conflict before the Civil War: landowner response to tenancy reform in 1930s Catalonia;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"DUPONT, BRANDON; Rosenbloom, Joshua L.";The U.S. Civil War destroyed a substantial fraction of southern wealth and emancipation transferred human capital to the formerly enslaved. The prevailing view of most economic historians is that the southern planter elite was able to retain its relative status despite these shocks. Previous studies have been hampered, however, by limits on the ability to link individuals between census years, and scholars have been forced to focus on persistence within one or a few counties. Recent advances in electronic access to the Federal Census manuscripts now make it possible to link individuals without these constraints. In this paper, we exploit the ability to search the full manuscript census to construct a sample that links top wealth holders in 1870 to their 1860 census records. Although there was an entrenched southern planter elite that retained their economic status, we find evidence that the turmoil of the 1860s opened greater opportunities for mobility in the South than was the case in the North, resulting in much greater turnover among wealthy southerners than among comparably wealthy northerners.;2018;The economic origins of the postwar southern elite;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Duquette, Nicolas J.;From 1917 to 2012, donations by high-income households in the USA have moved inversely with income inequality. This association contradicts historical narratives and prevailing theory, both of which that imply that high-income households donate rising income shares when inequality increases. The negative correlation holds both unconditionally and after conditioning on other explanatory variables, at both the national and US state levels. Low payout ratios of foundations and endowed charities, combined with this observed relationship, imply that differences in charitable giving will tend to entrench, not reduce, inequality across places over time.;2018;Inequality and philanthropy: High-income giving in the United States 1917–2012;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Edwards, Eric C.; Smith, Steven M.";We examine the role of irrigation in explaining U.S. agricultural gains post-1940. Specifically, we analyze how productivity and farm values changed in the western United States as a result of technological and policy changes that expanded access to ground and surface water. To statistically identify the effects, we compare counties based on their potential access to irrigation water defined by physical characteristics. We find areas with access to large streams and/or groundwater increase crop production relative to areas with only small streams by $19 billion annually, equivalent to 90 percent of the total annual increase in the western United States after 1940.;2018;The Role of Irrigation in the Development of Agriculture in the United States;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Eli, Shari; Salisbury, Laura; Shertzer, Allison";The American Civil War fractured communities in border states where families who would eventually support the Union or the Confederacy lived together prior to the conflict. We study the subsequent migration choices of Civil War veterans and their families using a unique longitudinal dataset covering enlistees from the border state of Kentucky. Nearly half of surviving Kentucky veterans moved to a new county between 1860 and 1880. We find strong evidence of sorting along ideological dimensions for veterans from both sides of the conflict. However, we find limited evidence of a positive economic return to these relocation decisions.;2018;Ideology and Migration after the American Civil War;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Erikson, Emily; Samila, Sampsa";We analyze patterns of informal information exchange by the English East India Company’s captains to assess the role of relational and institutional governance systems and uncertainty in encouraging information exchange. Using archival data from the emerging early-modern global trade network, we show that uncertainty drove information exchange. Relational-based contract enforcement mechanisms such as small group exchange were largely absent, and increasing institutional strength was associated with decreasing rates of information exchange. The results suggest that opportunity and demand were more important determinants of information exchange than the emergence of formal and informal governance systems.;2018;Networks, Institutions, and Uncertainty: Information Exchange in Early-Modern Markets;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
ETRO, FEDERICO;I analyzed the market of paintings in Florence and Italy (1285–1550). Hedonic regressions on real prices allowed me to advance evidence that the market was competitive and that an important determinant of artistic innovation was driven by economic incentives. Price differentials reflected quality differentials between painters as perceived at the time (whose proxy is the length of the biography of Vasari) and did not depend on regional destinations, as expected under monopolistic competition with free entry. An inverse-U relation between prices and age of execution is consistent with reputational theories of artistic effort, and prices increased since the 1420s.;2018;The Economics of Renaissance Art;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Federico, Giovanni; Tena-Junguito, Antonio";The period 1820–1870, commonly referred to as the “lost decades”, is widely regarded as the key moment in the opening of the gap between Latin America and the Unites States. We test this statement with a new export series and some tentative estimates of GDP trends. The overall performance of Latin American countries was quite good, although not outstanding. Mexico was hit by a foreign policy crisis, but the only real losers were the British and French colonies in the Caribbean. The emancipation of slaves caused a collapse in their exports, favoring other tropical countries, including Cuba and Brazil. Further South, independent countries such as Argentine and Chile increased their share of world trade. Overall, most of the divergence during the period 1820–1870 in the Americas was between tropical countries rather than between Latin America and North America.;2018;American divergence: Lost decades and Emancipation collapse in Latin America and the Caribbean 1820–1870;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
FELICE, EMANUELE;"The article presents updated estimates of GDP per capita, productivity, and employment for Italy’s regions, at the NUTS II level and at current borders, for the whole economy and its three branches (agriculture, industry, services): they span 140 years in 10-year benchmarks (1871–2011). The Moran’s indices of spatial autocorrelation, measures of sigma and beta convergence, Theil’s and Hanna-Kim’s decompositions are computed and discussed. Four phases in the history of regional inequality are identified: mild divergence (the liberal age), strong divergence (the two world wars and Fascism), general convergence (the golden age), and the “two Italies” tale (1971–2011). In the first two phases, we observe the formation of three macro-areas; in the last decades, we record convergence within the Center-North and thus an increasing North-South polarization, with differences in employment becoming more important than those in productivity.

Fochesato, Mattia;In this paper, I investigate the “little divergence” of late medieval and early modern Europe, focusing on the long run response of real wages to demographic changes. Through a quantitative analysis of the 14th–18th centuries series of real wages and population shocks in fourteen European cities, I find that in four north-western cities (Amsterdam, Antwerp, London, and Oxford) the urban real wages were detached from population before the Industrial Revolution, while, in the central and southern Europe wages had a moderate or negative response to population changes. In addition, I show that this different response dates back to the 16th century. I claim, that these two results support three possibly non alternative interpretations of the “little divergence”, either based on changes of fertility regimes, rural and urban labor organizations, or on the onset, in early modern north-western Europe, of non strictly Malthusian growth mechanisms.;2018;Origins of Europe’s north-south divide: Population changes, real wages and the ‘little divergence’ in early modern Europe;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Foreman-Peck, James; Zhou, Peng";Was the European marriage pattern an important contributor to England's precocious economic development? This article examines this question by embedding the possibility in a historically substantiated demographic-economic model, supported by both cross-section and long time series evidence. Persistent high mortality and powerful mortality shocks in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries lowered life expectations. Subsequently increased life expectancy reduced the number of births necessary to achieve a given family size. Fewer births were achieved by a higher age at first marriage of females. Later marriage not only constrained population growth but also provided greater opportunities for female informal learning, especially through ?service?. In a period when the family was the principal institution for socializing future workers, such learning was a significant contributor to the intergenerational transmission and accumulation of human capital. This article shows how, over the centuries, the gradual induced rise of human capital raised productivity and eventually brought about the industrial revolution. Without the contribution of late marriage to human capital accumulation broadly interpreted, real wages in England would not have increased strongly in the early nineteenth century and would have been much lower than actually achieved for several centuries.;2018;Late marriage as a contributor to the industrial revolution in England;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

This study revises the view that the scramble for West Africa occurred when its major export markets were in decline and argues that the larger weight of West Africa in French imperial trade strengthened the rationale for French instead of British initiative in the conquest of the interior.;2018;An Economic Rationale for the West African Scramble?

"Frémeaux, Nicolas; Leturcq, Marion";Using both administrative and survey data, we construct new series on prenuptial agreements and matrimonial property regimes in France from 1855 to 2010. Their evolution is far from linear: approximately 40% of newlywed couples signed a prenuptial agreement in 1855, but this share dropped to less than 10% after the reform of marital property regimes in 1965. It experienced an upturn after the introduction of no-fault divorce in 1975, and roughly 18% of newlywed couples signed a prenuptial agreement in 2010. We show how these changes are related to the gradual disappearance of traditional matrimonial property regimes in the late nineteenth century and to the rise in the prevalence of separate assets property regime in the late twentieth century. We conclude that before the recent decrease in marriage rates, the financial characteristics of marriage changed significantly over the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.;2018;Prenuptial agreements and matrimonial property regimes in France, 1855–2010;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Gadd, Stephen;This article considers deficiencies in the designation and reassessment of Legal Quays (those authorized for foreign trade), and the detrimental impact of these and other Elizabethan customs reforms from the perspective of Christchurch, a small coastal town then in Hampshire. Throttling the flow of merchandise through such places drove trade, and consequently economic growth, to those other places that enjoyed a convenient Legal Quay. In places without such quays, regulation and the farming of customs caused (and also facilitated) the suppression not only of international trade but also of domestic maritime trade. Though otherwise encouraged by Crown policy, entrepreneurial endeavour in Christchurch was stifled by customs regulation, in particular by the logistical burden introduced with remote record-keeping for coastal trade in the port books. The town seemed unable to break free of Southampton's controlling influence in order to realize its own apparent economic potential.;2018;Illegal quays: Elizabethan customs reforms and suppression of the coastal trade of Christchurch, Hampshire;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Geens, Sam;The exceptional weather conditions and associated harvest failures of 1315?17 marked the beginning of the worst subsistence crisis in European history. Until now, historians have mainly viewed the Great Famine, and medieval famines in general, through theoretical models of the larger fourteenth-century crisis. However, this article suggests that this approach is flawed and instead applies recent theories on contemporary famines to the crisis of 1315?17 in the county of Flanders. This new perspective not only leads to a re-examination of existing explanations, such as the role of warfare, but also reveals the importance of property rights in entitlement to food: the power of elites, the relative number of large-scale landowners, and the structure of household income all influenced peasants? degree of vulnerability.;2018;The Great Famine in the county of Flanders (1315–17): the complex interaction between weather, warfare, and property rights;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Gómez León, María;As was the case in the first decade of twenty-first century, between 1850 and 1950, Brazil experienced episodes of fast economic growth with an annual GDP per capita growth rate of 2 percent. However, by contrast to our understanding of recent developments in the economy of Brazil, we know little about the evolution of the Brazilian middle class over that period. Based on social tables and a new middle-class index, this article explores, for the first time, the trajectory of the Brazilian middle class from a historical perspective. It shows that moderate growth together with a rigid social hierarchy made unfeasible the rise of the middle class during the nineteenth century. Its emergence took place during the first decades of the twentieth century with the development of industry and the modernization and expansion of non-manual sectors. Its consolidation, however, was ultimately frustrated under the Vargas regime (1930–1945) in a climate of rapid economic growth but also of increasing inequality and social repression.;2018;The rise of the middle class in Brazil, 1850–1950;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Guinnane, Timothy W.; Martínez-Rodríguez, Susana";In 1919 Spain introduced the Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada (SRL), an enterprise form combining elements of the partnership and the corporation. An unusual feature of the Spanish Commercial Code allowed the Justice Ministry to authorize the form by fiat. The SRL did not have a statutory basis until 1953. Thus SRLs formed between 1919 and 1953 relied on other sources for their rules. These early SRLs had distinctive ownership, governance, and capital-structure patterns.

"Gutiérrez González, Pablo; Andersson, Lars Fredrik";Reinsurance is a vital financial device for enhancing underwriting capacity, ceding risks, and mitigating financial distress. By supplying financial resources and services, reinsurance can facilitate growth and expansion in the insurance business. Focusing on the insurance sector in the emerging Spanish economy and using a novel dataset on fire insurance companies, this article examines the role of fire insurance in the national capital formation, the importance of reinsurance as a vehicle for expanding the country's domestic underwriting capacity, and how the import of capital impacted on the balance of payment, from the introduction of the first comprehensive legislation regarding insurance in 1908 to the outbreak of the Civil War in 1936. Considering the situation of undercapitalization, the singularities of the insurance market, and the changes in regulatory schemes, we find that foreign reinsurance became a key financial vehicle for increasing underwriting capacity in Spain. We also show the struggle of an emerging market to find ways to keep the balance of current accounts and raise capital when financial infrastructure was underdeveloped. The diffusion of reinsurance networks from the core of industrial western countries towards emerging economies was one of the mechanisms for financial modernization on a global scale.;2018;Managing financial constraints: undercapitalization and underwriting capacity in Spanish fire insurance;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Haas, Michiel de; Frankema, Ewout H.P.";The renaissance of African economic history in the past decade has opened up new research avenues for studying the long-term social and economic development of Africa. A sensitive treatment of African realities in the evaluation of European colonial legacies and a critical stance towards the use of new sources and approaches is crucial. In this article, we engage with a recent article by Meier zu Selhausen and Weisdorf to show how selection biases in, and Eurocentric interpretations of, parish registers have provoked an overly optimistic account of European influences on the educational and occupational opportunities of African men and women. We confront their dataset, drawn from the marriage registers of the Anglican Cathedral in Kampala, with Uganda's 1991 census, and show that trends in the literacy and numeracy of men and women born in Kampala lagged half a century behind those who wedded in Namirembe Cathedral. We run a regression analysis showing that access to schooling during the colonial era was unequal along lines of gender and ethnicity. We foreground the role of Africans in the spread of education, and we argue that European influences were not just diffusive but also divisive, and that gender inequality was reconfigured rather than eliminated under colonial rule.;2018;Gender, ethnicity, and unequal opportunity in colonial Uganda: European influences, African realities, and the pitfalls of parish register data;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Hartwell, Christopher A.;Traditional wisdom in economics holds that institutional change runs from political institutions to economic ones, with the distribution of political power affecting the creation of property rights and rule of law. This hierarchy of institutions has been observed in macroeconomic policy, where it has long been understood that there are political incentives for economic mismanagement, namely the creation of inflation. But are there longer-term effects of currency manipulation on the rule of law in a country? That is, does the hierarchy not always hold? This paper answers this question by focusing on a specific case of monetary instability, the newly-independent Second Polish Republic of 1918 to 1939. Using appropriate econometric techniques on a new database of historical data, I find that monetary profligacy correlates strongly with significantly lower levels of the rule of law. This result is robust to several tests and most specifications, including the use of a new variable for measuring access to the political system. The results suggest that monetary instability is a threat to political institutions in its own right, eroding the rule of law in addition to creating macroeconomic difficulties.;2018;The “Hierarchy of Institutions” reconsidered: Monetary policy and its effect on the rule of law in interwar Poland;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Little of the gains went to the state-owned company: the Cape government seems instead to have mainly considered the railway as a means to local development.

Hoehn-Velasco, Lauren;This study assesses the mortality decline associated with one of the first and most extensive rural public health efforts in the United States. Between 1908 and 1933, county governments enacted county health departments (CHDs) that provided sanitation and child-oriented health services. Using an event study design, I exploit variation in the location and timing of CHD arrival to measure the health effects. I find that CHD entry led to a decline in infant mortality, but provided little advantage to overall population health. For infants, CHDs prevented two deaths per 1000 births, which accounts for 8–10% of the period-specific mortality decline. The effect is most substantial in rural-only counties where infant mortality declines by roughly three deaths per 1000 births.;2018;Explaining declines in US rural mortality, 1910–1933: The role of county health departments;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Hong, Ji Yeon; Paik, Christopher";In this article we examine the impact of pre-colonial educated elites and colonization on modernization. Using the case of Joseon, as Korea was known before being colonized by Japan in 1910, we investigate how the civil exam system and scholarly traditions, as well as the provision of public schools under Japanese colonial rule, influenced levels of literacy in the colony. We introduce novel data from Joseon's historical court examination archives, colonial education records, and censuses dating back to 1930. Our findings suggest that the spread of Korean literacy during the early colonial period was strongly correlated with the historical presence of civil exam passers from the Joseon Dynasty. Regions with a greater presence of educated elites later had higher numbers of Korean teachers, as well as more private schools established as alternatives to the colonial public schools.;2018;Colonization and education: exploring the legacy of local elites in Korea;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Applying a non-Bayesian time-varying model approach to the fundamental equation for spot returns and the futures premium, we detect when efficiency reductions in the two major rice markets occurred. We also examine how government interventions affected the rice markets in Japan, which colonized Taiwan and Korea before the Second World War, and argue that the function of rice futures markets crucially depended on the differences in the structure of rice spot markets. Initially the increased volume of imported rice of a different variety from domestic rice disrupted the rice futures markets. Then, government intervention in the rice futures markets failed to improve the disruption. Changes in colonial rice cropping successfully mitigated the disruption, and colonial rice was promoted in order to unify the different varieties of inland and colonial rice.;2018;The futures premium and rice market efficiency in prewar Japan;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Jaworski, Taylor; Smyth, Andrew";The commercial airframe industry in the US experienced a shakeout from the early 1930s into the post-Second World War period. Unlike shakeouts in automobiles, tyres, or televisions, the commercial airframe industry's early life cycle was affected by external factors, particularly government demand. Using newly digitized data on all planes introduced in the commercial market between 1926 and 1965, we find that commercial airframe manufacturers with bomber contracts during the Second World War were more likely to have postwar market share than firms without such contracts, controlling for plane characteristics and other forms of government contracting. We attribute the effect of bomber contracts to advantages in R&D learning capacity acquired by firms with military airframe contracts. Despite low (or zero) initial presence in the commercial market, these learning capacity advantages allowed such firms to survive the early period of the shakeout, and later to thrive.;2018;Shakeout in the early commercial airframe industry;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Karakoç, Ulaş;Based on the first estimates of output growth, this article shows that Egyptian industrial output grew at an accelerating rate in the interwar period and the country joined the industrial catch-up club after the Great Depression. What characterized the industrial re-composition was the major shift from export-processing and home-demand oriented sectors to the import competing textiles. That was in turn driven by the combined forces of massive terms of trade shock, tariff protection and stagnant incomes. Crucially, the panel-data analysis of disaggregated growth patterns indicates that the effect of tariff protection on growth was much smaller than usually assumed in the historiography.;2018;Industrial growth in interwar Egypt: first estimates, new insights;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Distorted labor incentives were a major constraint on growth since the mid-1960s, and explain the slowdown of the economy during the 1980s. In turn, labor incentives were distorted by the greater devolution of power to labor-managed firms.;2018;Socialist growth revisited: insights from Yugoslavia;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Lacroix, Jean;Which dimension of economic development spurred support to democracy? This study focuses on industrialization as the dimension triggering the process of political “modernization”. It uses a new dataset on Napoleonic plebiscites under the second French Empire (1852–1870). The results in those plebiscites provide a detailed cross-départements (French main administrative units) measure of opposition to autocracy. This study uses the variations in the thriving French modernization to disentangle the effect of industrialization on the vote from the one of other dimensions of economic development. Doubling industrial employment in the Puy-de-Dôme département (median of the distribution) would have decreased support to autocracy by 2.5–5.0 percentage points. An IV strategy using distance to the first city having adopted steam engines, access to coal and waterpower as instruments suggests causality. The baseline results are robust to controlling for other explanations of the vote and to using alternative specifications and estimation methods.;2018;Steam democracy up!

"Lambrecht, Thijs; Winter, Anne";Poor relief provisions in early modern Europe are often considered to have been characterized by a divide between a uniform, compulsory, tax-based, and relatively secure and generous poor law ?system? in England, and the more haphazard, voluntary, relatively parsimonious, insecure, and predominantly urban relief practices on the Continent. In this article we challenge these assumptions by arguing that the spread of agrarian capitalism in coastal Flanders fostered a reorganization of poor relief that displayed many features considered unique to the English old poor law, including the levying of poor taxes. By exploring the introduction, diffusion, and effects of poor taxes in the rural district of Furnes in the second half of the eighteenth century, we demonstrate that poor taxes were not unique to England, and sharpen our comparative understanding of the causes, implications, and conflicts associated with this particular way of raising revenue for the poor. This supports our more general contention that the influence of the normative framework should not be overstated: more than differences in legislation, similarities in socio-economic development can explain variations in relief practices in preindustrial Europe.;2018;An old poor law on the Continent?

Le Bris, David;Crashes, measured as strong price decreases, are sometimes difficult to reconcile with historical events. This can be explained by the fact that a price variation will have a greater negative impact in a stable financial context than a similar variation during a highly volatile period. For example, French stocks decreased painlessly by 16 per cent in August 2002, whereas a similar fall in January 1882 led to the failure of several brokers. Market volatility was very low at the end of the nineteenth century, whereas investors are now used to dealing with large price movements. A fall of 16 per cent was much more of a shock in 1882 than it would be today. To control for the instability of the volatility, a new method for identifying crashes is proposed. Each price variation is measured in numbers of standard deviations of the preceding period. These adjusted variations can then be ranked to identify the worst market crashes. This method is tested on four long-term series. A better match between crashes and historical events is achieved than with pure price variations. This improved matching brings new insights to several historical debates.;2018;What is a market crash?;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Lehmann-Hasemeyer, Sibylle; STREB, JOCHEN";Imperial chancellor Bismarck’s system of social insurance (with its three pillars health, accident and pension insurance) was an important role model for social security systems across Europe and in the USA. How the introduction of the German system changed economic expectations and decisions of the German workforce has not been researched, though. This article closes this gap by analyzing the development of Prussian savings banks’ deposits in the late 19th century with the help of a difference-in-difference-like approach. We show that, in the Prussian case, social security crowded out private savings considerably. As counterfactual voluntary savings would have been far from sufficient, however, Bismarck’s social insurance system might still have been needed to fight the misery workers and their families potentially faced in old age or times of sickness.;2018;Does Social Security Crowd Out Private Savings?

"Lévêque, Christophe; Saleh, Mohamed";We investigate the impact of state industrialization on residential segregation between Muslims and non-Muslims in nineteenth-century Cairo using individual-level census samples from 1848 and 1868. We measure local segregation by a simple inter-group isolation index, where Muslims’ (non-Muslims’) isolation is measured by the share of Muslim (non-Muslim) households in the local environment of each location. We find that relative to locations that did not witness changes in the instance of industrialization, the opening of Cairo railway station in 1856 differentially increased Muslims’ isolation from non-Muslims (conversely, decreased non-Muslims’ isolation) in its proximity and that the closures of textiles firms in 1848–1868 differentially decreased it. The results are arguably driven by an “indirect” labor market mechanism, whereby state industrialized firms crowded in private-sector unskilled jobs that attracted greater net inflows of rural immigrants and unskilled workers who were predominantly Muslims.;2018;Does industrialization affect segregation?

Lewis, Joshua;From 1930 to 1960 rural communities, mainly in the U.S. South and Southwest, gained access to electricity. In addition to lights, the benefits included easier clothes washing, refrigeration, and pumped water. This article uses differences in the timing of electricity access across rural counties to study the effects on infant mortality and fertility. Rural electrification led to substantial reductions in infant mortality but had little effect on women's fertility. The increase in electricity access between 1930 and 1960 can account for 15 to 19 percent of the decline in rural infant mortality during this period.;2018;Infant Health, Women's Fertility, and Rural Electrification in the United States, 1930–1960;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Logan, Trevon D.; Pritchett, Jonathan B.";We estimate marriage rates for enslaved African Americans using unique hospital records that report marital status for both free and enslaved patients. We find that marriage rates increased with age, that females had higher marriage rates than males, and that relatively more enslaved African Americans than whites were married, a result we partly attribute to the demographic composition of the hospital population. In addition, the admission records allow us to identify those slaves owned by slave traders. We find relatively high marriage rates among enslaved African Americans but significantly lower marriage rates for those slaves owned by traders, a result we attribute to the demographic composition of traded slaves and marital disruption caused by the slave trade. Comparisons with other postbellum sources provide suggestive support for the antebellum marriage patterns found in these hospital data.;2018;On the marital status of U.

"Meier Zu Selhausen, Felix; van LEEUWEN, MARCO H. D.; Weisdorf, Jacob L.";This article uses Anglican marriage registers from colonial and post-colonial Uganda to investigate long-term trends and determinants of intergenerational social mobility and colonial elite formation among Christian African men. It shows that the colonial era opened up new labour opportunities for these African converts, enabling them to take large steps up the social ladder regardless of their social origin. Contrary to the widespread belief that British indirect rule perpetuated the power of African political elites (chiefs), this article shows that a remarkably fluid colonial labour economy actually undermined their social advantages. Sons of chiefs gradually lost their high social-status monopoly to a new, commercially orientated, and well-educated class of Anglican Ugandans, who mostly came from non-elite and sometimes even lower-class backgrounds. The study also documents that the colonial administration and the Anglican mission functioned as key steps on the ladder to upward mobility. Mission education helped provide the skills and social reference needed to climb the ladder in exchange for compliance with the laws of the Anglican Church. These social mobility patterns persisted throughout the post-colonial era, despite rising levels of informal labour during Idi Amin's dictatorship.;2018;Social mobility among Christian Africans: evidence from Anglican marriage registers in Uganda, 1895–2011;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Meissner, Christopher M.; TANG, JOHN P.";Between 1880 and 1910, Japanese exports increased in volume, changed composition, and shifted from leading industrialized countries toward poorer Asian neighbors. Using a new dataset disaggregated by product and trade partner for the universe of Japanese exports, we find extensive margins accounted for 30 percent of export growth, with trade costs and market size associated with successful market entry. There was also considerable persistence in maintaining market presence and exit was rare.

Several possibilities are proposed, linking high population density to low inequality and to low elite extraction.;2018;Towards an explanation of inequality in premodern societies: the role of colonies, urbanization, and high population density;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Mitchell, Ian;Retail markets were a notable feature of urban England in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth, particularly in the midlands and north. Market halls were the most visible manifestation of this, and were important public buildings. This article looks beyond the imposing architecture to take a more critical view of their function and justification. It argues that while most were well-managed and earned income in excess of current expenditure, very substantial investment in large and elaborate buildings was hard to justify in purely financial terms. The return on capital was often negligible. Food and drink traders were the largest group in almost all markets, but there were significant numbers of traders selling clothing, textiles, and household goods. There was some justification to complaints that local authorities were providing publicly financed miscellaneous shops in competition with rent- and rate-paying shopkeepers. Most retailers supplying basic necessities operated from shops rather than markets. Saturday night markets were important in working-class culture and as a source of cheap food, but most day-to-day necessities were purchased from local shops or street traders.;2018;Retail markets in northern and midland England, 1870–1914: civic icon, municipal white elephant, or consumer paradise?;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Modalsli, Jørgen;This paper documents, for the first time, municipality- and occupation-level estimates of income inequality between individuals in a European country in the nineteenth century, using a combination of several detailed data sets for Norway in the late 1860s. Urban incomes were on average 4.5 times as high as rural incomes, and the average city Gini coefficient was twice the average rural municipality Gini. All high- or medium-income occupation groups exhibited substantial within-occupation income inequality. Across municipalities, income inequality is higher in high-income municipalities, and lower in muncipalities with high levels of fisheries and pastoral agriculture. While manufacturing activity is positively correlated with income inequality, the association is not apparent when other economic factors such as the mode of food production is accounted for. The income Gini for Norway as a whole is found to have been 0.546, slightly higher than estimates for the UK and US in the same period.;2018;The regional dispersion of income inequality in nineteenth-century Norway;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Monnet, Eric;The Mundell “trilemma” is widely used to discuss capital controls and monetary policy autonomy under Bretton Woods. Without denying its usefulness, this paper highlights two facts at odds with assumptions underlying the “trilemma” argument. First, conflicts between internal and external objectives were uncommon. Second, the use of quantitative credit controls allowed central banks to disconnect their interest rate from their monetary policy stance. This was considered by contemporaries as a way to escape international constraints. Capital controls were imposed to complement credit controls. Interest-rate spreads were neither a good measure of capital controls nor of central bank autonomy.;2018;Credit controls as an escape from the trilemma.

Nakabayashi, Masaki;Modern contract law generally does not allow property rights or similar claims to be made against employees. This undermines a claim on the return on the employer's investments in recruiting and training a worker, making them vulnerable to possible infringement from a bystander. Accordingly, employers? investment in recruiting and training might become deficient. Therefore, protecting an employer's investment, balanced against the mobility of the labour market for better employer/employee matches, has emerged as an issue during the transition towards a market-based economy. This article explores how the Japanese state court in its early period addressed this issue in the tight labour market of the silk-reeling industry, which was the leading industry at that time. Initially, the court directly protected the interests of employers whose employees were poached, at the expense of workers? mobility. Then, it seemed to govern transactions between employers indirectly as a shadow off-the-equilibrium path. Thus, an employer whose employee was poached and an employer who carried out the poaching would privately negotiate to settle the dispute, using a possible suit as a threat against the poacher. An examination of the suits that were actually filed supports this hypothesis. This indirect governance facilitated labour market mobility with some protection of the original employer's claim.;2018;From the substance to the shadow: the role of the court in Japanese labour markets;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Nakajima, Kentaro; OKAZAKI, TETSUJI";In 1910, Japan annexed Korea and integrated it into the Empire of Japan. According to its policy of assimilating colonies, the Japanese government intended to remove the tariffs between Japan and Korea, an aim which had almost been realized by 1923. The removal of the tariff barrier was supposed to improve market access between Japan and Korea. This article explores the implications of this event, focusing on the spatial distribution of economic activity in Japan. The regression results suggest that the integration of the Korean market increased population growth rates more in the regions close to the former border between Japan and Korea than in the other regions. Furthermore, after integration, the regions close to Korea that specialized in the fabric industry, whose products were the primary goods exported from Japan to Korea, experienced more population growth than other regions close to Korea did. These results suggest that market accessibility was indeed a determinant of the spatial distribution of economic activity. Our findings also indicate that the economic effect of colonization on the mainland was spatially heterogeneous and that a spatial viewpoint of the history of imperialism is important.;2018;The expanding Empire and spatial distribution of economic activity: the case of Japan's colonization of Korea during the prewar period;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Nikolić, Stefan;What determines the location of industry? Using panel data econometrics and a new dataset on interwar Yugoslavia the predictions of three theories—Heckscher-Ohlin, New Economic Geography, and Path Dependence—are quantified and compared. Results show that all three theories mattered and that New Economic Geography forces played a dominant role. The consensus view that several theories can simultaneously explain the distribution of industrial activity is thus reinforced. The main novelty is that Path Dependence can affect the location of industry in addition to Heckscher-Ohlin and New Economic Geography forces.;2018;Determinants of industrial location: Kingdom of Yugoslavia in the interwar period;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Olds, Kelly B.;In the last half of the nineteenth century, northern Taiwan experienced a boom in tea exports. This led to a large trade surplus accompanied by large inflows of silver money. The increase in the money supply did not have much effect on rice prices or consumption, but did lower interest rates. The lower interest rates and higher real money balances caused a large increase in real estate prices. This local financial glut lasted more than 20 years. Along the China coast, the banking system allowed businesses to move funds easily in and out of areas, such as northern Taiwan, but once silver reached Taiwanese farmers in the village economy, it did not flow so easily. Studies of early finance that focus on commercial networks generally overlook such problems.;2018;The Taiwan tea boom—a financial glut;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

We document that the relationship between the income of grandparents and grandchildren differs by gender. The socio-economic status of grandsons is more strongly associated with the status of paternal grandfathers than maternal grandfathers. The status of maternal grandfathers is more strongly correlated with the status of granddaughters than grandsons, while the opposite is true for paternal grandfathers. We argue that the findings can be rationalized by a model of gender-specific intergenerational transmission of traits and imperfect assortative mating.;2018;Three-generation mobility in the United States, 1850–1940: The role of maternal and paternal grandparents;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Opitz, Alexander;This paper examines the impact of the Revolution of 1905 on contemporary capital markets by applying an event study on Russian sovereign bonds. The landmark in Russian history comprised violent protests, resulting in the introduction of a parliament and the adoption of a constitution. While this was appreciated by investors, related events and the associated political and economic uncertainty—combined with large financial pressure—resulted in a negative securities market reaction. Further, the Russo-Japanese War, closely linked with the revolutionary events, is considered. Consistent with the established literature, war-related events did not always translate into price reactions. In addition to Berlin, the paper examines the Saint Petersburg Stock Exchange.

Palma, Nuno;This article provides a time series of coin and money supply estimates for six hundred years of English history. Two main estimation methods are proposed. The first (the direct method) is used to measure the value of government-provided, legal-tender coin supply only. Two varieties of the direct method are proposed. Additionally, an indirect method is proposed which relies on a combination of information about nominal GDP with an assumption regarding the evolution of velocity in time, and which can be used to calculate coin supply and M2. Both methods rely on benchmark values known for certain years, but no particular benchmark is determinant for the results. The new methodologies set out here may serve as a blueprint for a similar reconstruction of coin and money supply series for other economies for which analogous data are available.;2018;Reconstruction of money supply over the long run: the case of England, 1270–1870;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Quiroz Flores, Alejandro; Whiteley, Paul";Policy implementation has important electoral effects, but there is often a problem in determining if policy changes drive electoral behaviour or if the process works in reverse. To address this issue we exploit a unique natural experiment in Britain: the closure of thousands of train stations, known as the Beeching Cuts, on the eve of General Election of 1964. We use several statistical methods to show that policy implementation was unaffected by partisan considerations and therefore it can be regarded as an exogenous intervention. An individual-level model of voting intentions from the first British Election Study conducted in 1963, and an aggregate model of party vote shares in the General Election of 1964 show that the closures significantly changed voting support for the Conservative party. The 1964 election was very competitive and the closures clearly contributed to the defeat of the incumbent government after 13 years of uninterrupted rule.;2018;The “Beeching Axe” and electoral support in Britain;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Rose, Evan K.;I use new data on employment and job placements during WWII to characterize the wartime surge in female work and its subsequent impact on female employment in the United States. The geography of female wartime work was primarily driven by industrial mobilization, not drafted men’s withdrawal from local labor markets. After the war, returning veterans and sharp cutbacks in war-related industries displaced many new female entrants, despite interest in continued work. As a result, areas most exposed to wartime work show limited overall effects on female labor force participation in 1950 and only marginal increases in durables manufacturing employment.;2018;The Rise and Fall of Female Labor Force Participation During World War II in the United States;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Saleh, Mohamed;Self-selection of converts is an under-studied explanation of inter-religion socioeconomic status (SES) differences. Inspired by this conjecture, I trace the Coptic-Muslim SES gap in Egypt to self-selection-on-SES during Egypt’s conversion from Coptic Christianity to Islam. Selection was driven by a poll tax on non-Muslims, imposed from 641 until 1856, which induced poorer Copts to convert to Islam leading Copts to shrink into a better-off minority. Using novel data sources, I document that high-tax districts in 641–1100 had in 1848–1868 relatively fewer Copts, but greater SES differentials. Group restrictions on apprenticeships and schooling led the initial selection to perpetuate.;2018;On the Road to Heaven: Taxation, Conversions, and the Coptic-Muslim Socioeconomic Gap in Medieval Egypt;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Schneider, Eric B.; Ogasawara, Kota";This paper assesses how the disease environment, proxied by infant mortality rates, influenced children's growth in interwar Japan. We use data drawn from government records from 1929 to 1939 which report the mean heights of boys and girls in school at each age (6–18) for each of Japan's 47 prefectures. We focus on two key questions: (1) how important was the disease environment in infancy in shaping the growth pattern of children? and (2) were shocks to child health more salient in the first thousand days of life, often held as a critical window to prevent stunting, or at later ages? We quantify the characteristics of the growth pattern of birth cohorts using the SITAR growth model and then relate the predicted SITAR parameters to infant mortality in the year of birth. In addition, we test for instantaneous effects of morbidity, proxied by infant mortality, on growth at ages 6–11. We find that infant mortality in early life did not have a strong influence on the growth pattern of children, but there were statistically significant and economically meaningful instantaneous effects of infant mortality on child height at ages 6–11 for both boys and girls. This suggests that interventions outside of the thousand-day critical window can be effective and that the secular increase in height in interwar Japan was more strongly influenced by cumulative responses to the health environment across child development rather than simply improvements in early life health.;2018;Disease and child growth in industrialising Japan: Critical windows and the growth pattern, 1917–39;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Smith, Edmond;The foundation of the East India Company coincided with a dramatic expansion of England's overseas activities brought about through new trading, colonial, and exploratory ventures. This period has received considerable attention in relation to the development of the British Empire, but little is known about how merchants and other commercial actors invested in and contributed to these organizations. Using a newly developed dataset of membership and investment in overseas activities, this article reconstructs the individual portfolios of East India Company members in 1599, 1613, and 1624. This analysis reveals that investors took advantage of opportunities across the globe, and diverse portfolios were common. The implications of this are two-fold. First, this article makes clear that our current understanding of the East India Company as closely connected with the Levant Company is not sustained with evidence from investment patterns. Second, the interests of London's commercial community suggest new avenues for understanding the early British Empire as a tightly connected, globally focused set of institutions, people, and networks.;2018;The global interests of London's commercial community, 1599–1625: investment in the East India Company;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Stobart, Jon; Bailey, Lucy";Village shops have been largely overlooked in the recent literature on British retailing in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, which has sought to redefine the parameters and timing of retail transformation. While urban shops have been explored in detail, often in ways that highlight their role in a parallel transformation in consumption patterns, little attempt has been made to look inside village shops or examine the character and practices of rural retailers. This article addresses this lacuna and offers fresh insights into the shifting position of village shops in these broader economic, business, and social changes. Taking a long view of the period c. 1660?1860, it draws on a wide range of sources to examine the stock sold and the degree of specialization exhibited by village shops, and the changing trading practices of village shopkeepers, including the provision of credit, the pricing of goods, and marketing activities. In doing so, the article highlights both long-term continuities and important innovations of the type that also characterize urban shops, and argues that village shops, while central to rural social and economic networks, were also intimately bound into broader retail systems.;2018;Retail revolution and the village shop, c. 1660–1860;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The main hypothesis stresses that the mobilization of savings previously accumulated and hoarded in gold was a distinctive and important origin of resources. This result challenges older assumptions about the economic changes of the period, and provides a vision somewhat different of the first steps of Spain’s economic modernization.;2018;Emptying the Coffers: Old Money to Build New Railways, Spain 1850–1874;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Timini, Jacopo;The Latin Monetary Union (LMU) agreement signed in December 1865 by France, Italy, Belgium and Switzerland standardised gold and silver coinage in member countries and allowed free circulation of national coins in the Union. In his seminal study, Flandreau found no evidence of an overall positive effect of the LMU on trade. In this article, I estimate the effects of this currency agreement on trade. In my gravity model I explicitly take into account the changing conditions in the international environment that affected the LMU underlying economic foundations (i.e., the limits on silver coinage agreed upon in 1874) and its rules (i.e., the “liquidation clause” of 1885). I also test the existence of heterogeneous effects on bilateral trade within the LMU. In line with Flandreau, I find no significant LMU trade effects. However, I find support for the hypothesis that the LMU had significant trade effects for the period 1865–1874. These effects were nonetheless concentrated in trade flows between France and the rest of LMU members, following a hub-and-spokes structure. Moreover, I find evidence for the existence of a 1874 “LMU-wide” structural break, which affected the course of trade flows within the Union.;2018;Currency unions and heterogeneous trade effects: the case of the Latin Monetary Union*;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"van Bavel, Bas; BURINGH, ELTJO; Dijkman, Jessica";This article contributes to the ongoing debate on the causes of the great divergence by comparing the use of expensive labour-saving capital goods?water-mills, windmills, and cranes?in medieval western Europe and the Middle East. Using novel ways of measuring, we find that whereas the use of these goods increased in Europe, in the Middle East their prevalence decreased, or they were not used at all. We investigate several possible explanations and reject most of them, including religion, geography, technological knowledge, and disparities in wages and cost of capital. Our analysis shows that differences in lordship systems and the security of property rights best explain the patterns found.;2018;Mills, cranes, and the great divergence: the use of immovable capital goods in western Europe and the Middle East, ninth to sixteenth centuries;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
van Waijenburg, Marlous;Although recent studies on African colonial tax systems have deepened our understanding of early fiscal capacity building efforts in the region, they have largely ignored the contributions from a widely used but invisible source of state revenue: that of labor contributions. Exploiting data on corvée systems in French Africa, this is the first article to make these in-kind taxes “visible” by estimating a lower bound of how much they augmented governments' revenue base. Revealing that labor taxes constituted in most places the largest component of early colonial budgets, I argue that studies on historical taxation need to make a greater effort to integrate this significant source of government revenue into their analysis.;2018;Financing the African Colonial State: The Revenue Imperative and Forced Labor;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Varian, Brian D.;Previous scholarship has suggested that British trade was generally unaffected by foreign tariffs during the period from 1870 to 1913. This article focuses specifically on Anglo-American trade, which was the largest bilateral flow of trade during the first era of globalization, and finds that tariffs were the sole intertemporal determinant of Anglo-American trade costs. However, the determinacy of tariffs for Anglo-American trade costs only becomes apparent when the tariff variable incorporates a measure of the bilateral American tariff toward Britain, which this article reconstructs. The article concludes by claiming that Anglo-American trade represents a major qualification to any emerging consensus that foreign tariffs were of minor significance to the trade of late nineteenth-century Britain.;2018;Anglo-American trade costs during the first era of globalization: the contribution of a bilateral tariff series†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Ward, J. R.;An older view among historians, predominant until about 1970, held that British West Indian slave maintenance standards were significantly improved or ?ameliorated? from the later eighteenth century. Subsequent research has disputed this consensus, although uncertainty remains on key details of slave diet, labour, and demography. As an alternative welfare measure, this study examines the reported heights of detained runaway slaves and ex-slaves held between 1788 and 1838 at workhouses on Jamaica, the most important British West Indian colony. Analytical challenges arise through the limited age data. Also, a disproportionate share of the detainees had an urban background. However, these problems can be overcome with help from local estate records and from eastern Caribbean anthropometric evidence. The mean stature of Jamaica-born adult detainees clearly rose during the period, and they gained a widening height advantage relative to their Africa-born counterparts. This offers a useful indicator of trends for the enslaved population at large. The workhouse material confirms ?old school? judgements that substantive amelioration occurred, as a course of deliberate slaveholder policy.;2018;The amelioration of British West Indian slavery: anthropometric evidence;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Webster, Ian;The nineteenth-century archive of the Public Works Loan Board (PWLB) has been overlooked by economic historians. Yet the archive reveals how the PWLB came to play a major part in the financing of new schools, water supplies and sewers in the 1870s. Ten thousand loan applications have been analysed to highlight the changing patterns of the PWLB's lending, while the 60 volumes of minutes indicate why the pattern changed. The analysis shows that in the 1870s there was a large rise in local infrastructure investment caused by the switch from permissive to compulsory public health and education legislation. At the same time, the PWLB became predominantly a low-cost, rather than a market rate, lender. This change shows how MPs? views developed as they became more sensitive to the impact of the local costs of parliamentary legislation. Overall, the activities of the PWLB illustrate the legislative and institutional changes that contributed significantly to the growth in the role and spending of the state.;2018;The Public Works Loan Board and the growth of the state in nineteenth-century England;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Whatley, Warren C.;The Gun-Slave Hypothesis is the long-standing idea that European gunpowder technology played a key role in growing the transatlantic slave trade. I combine annual data from the Transatlantic Slave Trade Database and the Anglo–African Trade Statistics to estimate a Vector Error Correction Model of the 18th century British slave trade that captures four versions of the Gun-Slave Hypothesis: guns-for-slaves-in-exchange, guns-for-slaves-in-production, slaves-for-guns-derived and the gun-slave cycle. Three econometric results emerge. (1) Gunpowder imports and slave exports were co-integrated in a long-run equilibrium relationship. (2) Positive deviations from equilibrium gunpowder “produced” additional slave exports. This guns-for-slaves-in-production result survives 17 placebo tests that replace gunpowder with non-lethal commodities imports. It is also confirmed by an instrumental variables estimation that uses excess capacity in the British gunpowder industry as an instrument for gunpowder. (3) Additional slave exports attracted additional gunpowder imports for 2–3 more years. Together these dynamics formed a gun-slave cycle. Impulse-response functions generate large increases in slave export in response to increases in gunpowder imports. I use these results to explain the growth of slave exports along the Guinea Coast of Africa in the 18th century.;2018;The gun-slave hypothesis and the 18th century British slave trade;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Witzel de Souza, Bruno Gabriel;This article studies the path dependence of human capital accumulation in the state of S?o Paulo, Brazil. It focuses on the impacts of German-speaking immigrants on education through three channels: their share of the population in the nineteenth century, their on-the-job skills, and the schools they founded. Using a new dataset based on almanacs from 1873 and 1888, these effects are evaluated for the nineteenth, early twentieth, and early twenty-first centuries. The article shows that the institutionalized demand for education of these immigrants, reflected by the establishment of schools, was their main contribution to the accumulation of human capital. The effect of German schools on educational levels required a period to mature and dissipated over time. Nevertheless, its influence was substantial at the beginning of the twentieth century, affecting enrolment levels in private and state schools, a result that suggests the existence of spillover and contagion effects. Moreover, current indicators for stocks and flows of human capital in S?o Paulo are strongly associated with their historical levels. At the same time, this path dependence is conditional on the type of school: while a positive persistence is found for the private system throughout the twentieth century, convergence occurred in state schools.;2018;Immigration and the path dependence of education: the case of German-speakers in São Paulo, Brazil (1840–1920);The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Abel, Martin;In an attempt to divide and marginalize the black population, the apartheid regime forcefully relocated some 3.5 million South Africans to rural homelands between 1960 and 1980. This event, considered one of history’s largest social engineering exercises, created overcrowded and economically deprived communities of displaced people. This article uses geo-coded data to explore the long-term effects of removals on current measures of social capital. Comparing people within the same homeland, I show that those living close to former resettlement camps have higher levels of trust towards members of their social network, people in general, and members of other ethnic groups. These findings are important, as solidarity among suppressed people is believed to be a critical factor in explaining the demise of the apartheid regime.;2019;Long-Run Effects of Forced Resettlement: Evidence from Apartheid South Africa;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
ACCOMINOTTI, OLIVIER;In May to July 1931, a series of financial panics shook central Europe before spreading to the rest of the world. This article explores the role of cross-border banking linkages in propagating the central European crisis to Britain and the US. Using archival bank-level data, the article documents US and British banks? exposure to central European frozen credits in 1931. Central European lending was mostly done by large and diversified commercial banks in the US and by small and geographically specialized merchant banks/acceptance houses in Britain. Differences in the organization of international bank lending explain why the central European crisis disturbed few US banks but endangered many British financial institutions.;2019;International banking and transmission of the 1931 financial crisis;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Ağır, Seven; Artunç, Cihan";Turkey imposed a controversial tax on wealth to finance the army in 1942. This tax was arbitrarily assessed and fell disproportionately on non-Muslim minorities. We study the heterogeneous impact of this tax on firms by assembling a new dataset of all enterprises in Istanbul between 1926 and 1950. We find that the tax led to the liquidation of non-Muslim-owned firms, which were older and more productive, reduced the formation of new businesses with non-Muslim owners, and replaced them with frailer Muslim-owned startups. The tax helped “nationalize” the Turkish economy, but had negative implications for productivity and growth.;2019;The Wealth Tax of 1942 and the Disappearance of Non-Muslim Enterprises in Turkey;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Aidt, Toke S.; FRANCK, RAPHAËL";The Great Reform Act of 1832 was a watershed for democracy in Great Britain. We study the vote on 22 March 1831 in the House of Commons to test three competing theories of democratization: public opinion, political expedience, and threat of revolution. Peaceful agitation and mass-support for reform played an important role. Political expedience also motivated some members of Parliament to support the reform, especially if they were elected in constituencies located in counties that would gain seats. Violent unrest in urban but not in rural areas had some influence on the members of Parliament. Counterfactual scenarios suggest that the reform bill would not have obtained a majority in the House of Commons in the absence of these factors.;2019;What Motivates an Oligarchic Elite to Democratize?

We find evidence of a highly selective move towards protectionism following the adoption of the National Policy in 1879.

"ALFANI, GUIDO; Percoco, Marco";This article aims to analyse the effects of plague on the long-term development of Italian cities, with particular attention to the 1629?30 epidemic. By using a new dataset on plague mortality rates in 56 cities covering the period c. 1575?1700, an economic geography model verifying the existence of multiple equilibria is estimated. It is found that cities severely affected by the 1629?30 plague were displaced to a lower growth path. It is also found that plague caused long-lasting damage to the size of Italian urban populations and to urbanization rates. These findings support the hypothesis that seventeenth-century plagues played a fundamental role in triggering the process of relative decline of the Italian economies.;2019;Plague and long-term development: the lasting effects of the 1629–30 epidemic on the Italian cities;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Allen, Robert C.;This article measures the size and incomes of six major social classes across the industrial revolution using social tables for England and Wales in 1688, 1759, 1798, 1846, and 1867. Lindert and Williamson famously revised these tables, and this article extends their work in three directions. First, servants are removed from middle- and upper-class households in the tables of King, Massie, and Colquhoun and tallied separately. Second, estimates are made for the same tables of the number and incomes of women and children employed in the various occupations, and, third, incomes are broken down into rents, profits, and employment income. These extensions to the tables allow variables to be computed that can be checked against independent estimates as a validation exercise. The tables are retabulated in a standardized set of six social groups to highlight the changing structure of society across the industrial revolution. Gini coefficients are computed from the social tables to measure inequality. These measures confirm that Britain traversed a ?Kuznets curve? in this period. Changes in overall inequality are related to the changing fortunes of the major social classes.;2019;Class structure and inequality during the industrial revolution: lessons from England's social tables, 1688–1867;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Russian living standards grew little between 1853 and 1913, but doubled between 1913 and 1928 due to the exchange rate, price, and employment policies followed by the regime.

This paper constructs new annual estimates of real GDP between 1842 and 1913 based on a novel two-stage econometric approach. Our results show that while living standards approximately tripled in this period, development was uneven with contractions in economic activity not only during the Great Famine but also between the late 1890s and the First World War. As a proof of concept, we also apply our methodology to Swedish data. The resulting estimates closely match existing historical national accounts.;2019;Irish GDP between the Famine and the First World War: estimates based on a dynamic factor model;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Andersson, Jens; Berger, Thor";A large literature emphasizes that elite capture of political institutions hampered the spread of mass schooling in the nineteenth and twentieth century. We collect new data on investments in elementary education and the distribution of voting rights for more than 2,000 local governments in nineteenth-century Sweden and document that educational expenditure was higher where the distribution of political power was more unequal. In particular, areas governed by local landed elites?even those where a single landowner had de jure dictatorial powers?invested substantially more in mass schooling relative to areas where political power was more widely shared, or where it lay in the hands of capitalist elites. Our findings lend quantitative support to an earlier literature produced by economic and social historians which argues that landed elites advanced mass schooling as part of their historical role as patrons of the local community and as a response to the increasing proletarianization of the rural population, while also furthering our understanding of how Sweden maintained a high level of human capital despite its low level of economic development and restricted franchise in the nineteenth century.;2019;Elites and the expansion of education in nineteenth-century Sweden;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Annaert, Jan; BUELENS, FRANS; Cuyvers, Ludo";Portfolio investors during 1880–1914 were motivated by the prospect of higher (ex-ante) expected returns and the search for diversification. At the London stock exchange, such overseas portfolios also realised higher (ex-post) returns than domestic portfolios. However, this result cannot be generalised. Higher return expectations for portfolio investments in stocks of companies investing in Russia (listed at the Brussels Stock Exchange) did not realise in the end, mainly due to the exceptional and unforeseeable economic, social, political and geo-political events during the period 1899–1907 and the outbreak of the First World War—these risks being underestimated by investors.;2019;Returns on foreign investment during the pre-1914 era: the case of Russia;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Artunç, Cihan;This article examines the composition of firm ownership and entrepreneurship in Egypt between 1910 and 1949 by assembling a novel dataset on multi-owned firms. The evidence supports two main results. First, Muslim participation remained disproportionately low in partnerships but was distinctly high in corporations relative to non-Muslims. Second, Muslim-owned firms were frailer and more likely to experience early exits. The findings are consistent with the view that the region's institutional legacy, such as disparities in physical or human capital, created obstacles for Muslims. When these implications are tested, the findings show that only small-scale Muslim firms had restricted access to capital. The skewness in Muslim firms? entry and start-up size is probably the result of legal distortions introduced by the government, which entrenched a small class of political elites in large-scale firms.;2019;Religious minorities and firm ownership in early twentieth-century Egypt;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Atack, Jeremy; Margo, Robert A.";In nineteenth-century America, blacksmiths were a fixture in every village, town, and city, producing a diverse range of products from axes to wheels and services from repairs to horse shoeing. In constructing his historical GNP accounts, Gallman opted to exclude these “jacks-of-all-trades” from the manufacturing sector, classifying them instead as part of the service sector. However, using establishment-level data for blacksmiths from the federal censuses of manufactures for 1850, 1860, and 1870, we re-examine that choice and show that blacksmiths were an important, if declining, source of manufactured goods. Moreover, as quintessential artisan shops, a close analysis of their structure and operation helps resolve several key puzzles regarding industrialization in the nineteenth century. As “jacks-of-all-trades,” they were generally masters of none (except for their service activities). Moreover, the historical record reveals that several of those who managed to achieve mastery moved on to become specialized manufacturers of that specific product. Such specialized producers had higher productivity levels than those calling themselves blacksmiths producing the same goods, explaining changes in industry mix and the decline of the blacksmith in manufacturing.;2019;Gallman revisited: blacksmithing and American manufacturing, 1850–1870;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Baker, Richard B.;On average, per pupil expenditures were much lower in schools attended by African-American children than in schools attended by whites during the period of de jure segregation. Little is known, however, about what motivated school boards to maintain this inequality or why they funded African-American schools at all. Using newly collected data on schools in early twentieth-century Georgia and exploiting a funding shock resulting from the rules regarding appropriations from the State School Fund, this paper examines how school boards divvied up the proceeds of exogenous shifts in school budgets by race. In response to a one dollar per pupil budget cut, instructional expenditures in white schools fell by $1.21 per pupil, while they remained almost unchanged in African-American schools. Thus, whites, rather than African Americans, bore the brunt of budget cuts, indicating that there was little fat to trim from the budgets of African-American schools.;2019;Finding the fat: The relative impact of budget fluctuations on African-American schools;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Bartels, Charlotte;This study provides new evidence on top income shares in Germany from industrialization to the present. Income concentration was high in the nineteenth century, dropped sharply after WWI and during the hyperinflation years of the 1920s, then increased rapidly throughout the Nazi period beginning in the 1930s. Following the end of WWII, German top income shares returned to 1920s levels. The German pattern stands in contrast to developments in France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, where WWII brought a sizeable and lasting reduction in top income shares. Since the turn of the millennium, income concentration in Germany has been on the rise and is today among the highest in Europe. The capital share is consistently positively associated with income concentration, whereas growth, technological change, trade, unions, and top tax rates are positively associated in some periods and negative in others.;2019;Top Incomes in Germany, 1871–2014;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

However, growth in Japan remained slower than in northwest Europe so that Japan continued to fall behind until after the institutional reforms of the early Meiji period.

Bekar, Cliff T.;I present evidence that shocks to the Medieval English harvest persisted. Hypothesized mechanisms include varying supplies of seed corn and other complementary harvest inputs. Peasants are modeled as trading off current consumption against grain stores and sow rates so that subsistence-level shocks may persist. For my sample I find that a failed harvest increased the probability of subsequent harvest failure by 20–30 percent. Grain yields are analyzed as a strongly balanced panel by year, manor, and crop. While I reject the hypothesis that harvests were self-contained annual events, I caution against linking harvest persistence directly to runs in grain prices.;2019;The Persistence of Harvest Shocks in Medieval England;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Berger, Thor;Sweden's population doubled in size between 1750 and 1850 despite a century of stagnating per capita incomes and real wages, which has led many historians to attribute the population explosion to the introduction of the potato. This article provides the first systematic evidence on the potato's contribution to Swedish living standards and population growth. Potatoes at least doubled output per acre, and welfare ratios that account for potato consumption imply that they raised living standards significantly for labourers. Estimates that exploit regional differences in the suitability of land for cultivating potatoes further show that cities, counties, and rural parishes with more land suitable for potato cultivation experienced a sharp relative acceleration in population growth as the potato spread in the early nineteenth century. An expansion of the population was mainly driven by relative increases in fertility and, consistent with Malthusian predictions, there was no long-run impact on per capita incomes. According to these estimates, the introduction and spread of the potato can account for one-tenth of population growth between 1800 and 1850, thus suggesting that it was an important catalyst for the Swedish population explosion.;2019;Adopting a new technology: potatoes and population growth in the periphery;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Berger, Thor;This paper studies the impact of railroads on growth and structural transformation in 19th-century Sweden. To establish causality, the analysis exploits that the main state-owned lines of the network traversed rural communities that were not directly targeted by planners. Areas “accidentally” traversed by one of these trunk lines experienced substantially more rapid population growth and structural transformation over the next 50 years. These findings suggest that investments in transportation networks can spur industrial development and that the railroad is an important factor to account for Sweden’s rapid catch-up with the leading European industrializers.;2019;Railroads and Rural Industrialization: evidence from a Historical Policy Experiment;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Bharadwaj, Prashant; Ali Mirza, Rinchan";"The partition of British India in 1947 resulted in one of the largest and most rapid migrations and population transfers of the 20th century. Using refugee presence by 1951 as a measure for the intensity of the impact of the population transfer, and district level data on agricultural output between 1911 and 2009 from India, we find using difference in differences and event study approaches that areas that received more refugees have higher average yields, are more likely to take up high yielding varieties of seeds, and are more likely to use agricultural technologies. The increase in yields and use of agricultural technology coincide with the timing of the Green Revolution in India. Using pre-partition data, we show that refugee placement is uncorrelated with soil and water table characteristics, agricultural infrastructure, and agricultural yields prior to 1947; hence, the effects are not explained by selective movement into districts with a higher potential for agricultural development. We highlight refugee literacy and land reforms in areas with refugees as two of the many potential mechanisms that could be driving these effects.";2019;Displacement and development: Long term impacts of population transfer in India;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Bogart, Dan;Private and local investors provided much of the capital to improve England's infrastructure during its industrialization. This study investigates the financial returns to investors in turnpike road trusts. It draws on parliamentary reports which provide comprehensive data on finances, including payments to bondholders. One key finding is that turnpike trusts paid their bondholders a return above the yield on government bonds before 1850. Afterwards turnpike interest payments declined, yet they still yielded competitive returns. Another key finding is that the risks were modest. Returns to holding individual turnpike bonds varied, with most paying 4 to 5 per cent and some paying zero. The latter were not the majority and in many cases interest payments resumed within a few years. Diversified portfolios of turnpike bonds enjoyed lower risks, and outperformed portfolios with railway and canal securities traded on the London exchange before 1850. Overall, the results contribute to a better understanding of the risks and returns associated with investing in early public works.;2019;Investing in early public works: financial risks and returns in English and Welsh turnpikes, 1820–82;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Bogart, Dan; Lefors, Michael; Satchell, A.E.M.";Canals played a key role in the industrial revolution by creating the infrastructure for inland waterway transport. Public carriers responded to canals and the growing demand for transport by innovating in service speed, quality, and reliability. How did their innovations affect the transport market, especially road carriers? One hypothesis is that road and canal carriers complemented one another, offering services with different speeds and prices. Another sees them as competitors with canal carriers winning based on their lower operating costs. We test these hypotheses using London trade directories, which detail road and waterway services from London to most towns and cities from 1779 to 1827. Our main results show that introducing the standard canal barge service between London and a major city had no effect on the number of road carrier services supplied to that same city-pair. By contrast, introducing an express canal service, known as the fly boat, significantly reduced road carrier services supplied. Fly boats are found to have weaker competition effects if the ratio of waterway to road distance was greater and on short and long route distances. The results provide new insights on the importance of speed and service innovation during the industrial revolution.;2019;Canal carriers and creative destruction in English transport;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Sterling’s devaluation in November 1967 eventually spurred speculation and unbearable losses for the Pool. Inflationary U.S. policies were weakening confidence in the dollar.

Bottomley, Sean;It was a commonplace among contemporaries, and remains received wisdom today, that inventors were poorly remunerated during the industrial revolution. Adapting a dataset of 759 British inventors, this article presents the first large-scale attempt to examine the issue systematically. Using probate information, the article shows that inventors were extremely wealthy relative to the adult male population. Inventors were also significantly wealthier than another group who would have received a similar inheritance (in terms of both financial and social capital) and entered similar occupations: their brothers.

"Brée, Sandra; La Croix, David de";To better understand the forces underlying fertility decisions, we look at the forerunners of fertility decline. In Rouen, France, completed fertility dropped between 1640 and 1792 from 7.4 to 4.2 children. We review possible explanations and keep only three: increases in materialism, in women’s empowerment, and in returns to education. The methodology is one of analytic narrative, bringing together descriptive evidence with a theoretical model. We accordingly propose a theory showing that we can discriminate between these explanations by looking at childlessness and its social gradient. An increase in materialism or, under certain conditions, in women’s empowerment, leads to an increase in childlessness, while an increase in the return to education leads to a decrease in childlessness. Looking at the Rouen data, childlessness was clearly on the rise, from 4% in 1640 to 10% at the end of the eighteenth century, which appears to discredit the explanation based on increasing returns to education, at least for this period.;2019;Key forces behind the decline of fertility: lessons from childlessness in Rouen before the industrial revolution;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Burnard, Trevor; Panza, Laura; Williamson, Jeffrey G.";This paper provides the first quantitative assessment of colonial Jamaican real incomes and income inequality. We collect local prices to construct cost of living and purchasing power parity indicators. The latter lowers Jamaica's GDP per capita compared with the rest of the Atlantic economy. We also compute welfare ratios for a range of occupations and build a social table. We find that, being a net food importer, the slave colony had extremely high living costs, which rose steeply during the American War of Independence, and low standards of living, particularly for its enslaved population, but also for the free unskilled population that competed with slave labor. Our results also show that due to its extreme poverty for the many in the middle of great wealth for the few, Jamaica was the most unequal place yet studied in the pre-modern world. Furthermore, all of these characteristics applied to the free population alone.;2019;Living costs, real incomes and inequality in colonial Jamaica;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Carmona, Juan; Rosés, Joan Ramón; Simpson, James";"Spanish land reform, involving the breakup of the large southern estates, was a central issue during the first decades of the twentieth century, and was justified on economic and political grounds. This article employs new provincial data on landless workers, land prices, and agrarian wages to consider whether government intervention was needed because of the failure of the free action of markets to redistribute land. Our evidence shows that the relative number of landless workers decreased significantly from 1860 to 1930, before the approval of the 1932 Land reform during the Second Republic (1931?6). This was due to two interrelated market forces: the falling ratio between land prices and rural wages, which made plots of land cheaper for landless workers to rent and buy; and structural change that drained the rural population from the countryside Given that shifts in factor prices were already helping workers gain access to land by the 1930s, the economic arguments for introducing reform at that time remain unclear.";2019;The question of land access and the Spanish land reform of 1932;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Castañeda Dower, Paul; MARKEVICH, ANDREI";We study the effect of changes in land tenure, launched by the 1906 Stolypin reform, on agricultural productivity in Imperial Russia. The reform allowed peasants to obtain individual land titles and consolidate separated land strips into a single privatized allotment. We present evidence that land consolidations enabled peasants to make independent production decisions from the village commune and take advantage of readily accessible technological advancements. In contrast, land titles decreased land productivity in the short-run, but the overall effect of the reform on land productivity was still positive.;2019;The Stolypin reform and agricultural productivity in late imperial Russia;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Cermeño, Alexandra L.;Despite the expanding role of services in the global economy, economic history has paid little attention to their geographic localization. This paper provides a description of the increasing specialization and localization patterns of services across US counties compared to other sectors from 1930 to 2010. It stresses that market potential influences most of these changes. I use census employment data by sector to re-examine the debate of comparative advantage vs. economic geography on county location coefficients for services. The interaction between county and industry characteristics shows that the geography of services has been influenced by market potential since 1980. OLS and 2SLS results suggest a cumulative effect of increasing returns to scale that enhanced the agglomeration of services through linkages with other services and manufacturing firms. This provides a complementary view on the transformation of the Manufacturing Belt as the cradle of the service economy.;2019;The driving forces of service localization during the twentieth century: evidence from the United States;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Chapman, Jonathan;It is well-recognized that both improved nutrition and sanitation infrastructure are important contributors to mortality decline. However, the relative importance of the two factors is difficult to quantify since most studies are limited to testing the effects of specific sanitary improvements. This article uses new historical data regarding total investment in urban infrastructure, measured using the outstanding loan stock, to estimate the extent to which the mortality decline in England and Wales between 1861 and 1900 can be attributed to government expenditure. Fixed effects regressions indicate that infrastructure investment explains approximately 30 per cent of the decline in mortality between 1861 and 1900. Since these specifications may not fully account for the endogeneity between investment and mortality, additional specifications are estimated using lagged investment as an instrument for current investment. These estimates suggest that government investment was the major contributor to mortality decline, explaining up to 60 per cent of the reduction in total urban mortality between 1861 and 1900. Additional results indicate that investment in urban infrastructure led to declines in mortality from both waterborne and airborne diseases.;2019;The contribution of infrastructure investment to Britain's urban mortality decline, 1861–1900;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"CICCARELLI, CARLO; Weisdorf, Jacob L.";Blindfolded by a lack of earlier systematic data, comparative studies of regional developments in historical Italy begin with the formation of the Italian state, in 1861. We use literacy rates reported in post-1861 population censuses combined with the fact that literacy skills were usually achieved during youth to predict regional literacy developments all the way back to 1821. Our analysis informs ongoing debates about the origins and long-run evolution of Italy’s north–south divide. By lifting the veil into Italy’s pre-unification past, we establish that the north–south literacy gap was substantial already in 1821, grew markedly wider in the first half of the nineteenth century, only to revert back in 1911 to the 1821 level. Gender gaps in literacy essentially close in the north during 1821–1911, while in the south they registered a secular stagnation. This opens an avenue for investigating a new dimension of the north–south gap largely overlooked in the existing literature.;2019;Pioneering into the past: Regional literacy developments in Italy before Italy†;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Clark, Gregory; Page, Marianne E.";The English Old Poor Law, which before 1834 provided welfare to the elderly, children, the improvident, and the unfortunate, was a bête noire of the new discipline of Political Economy. Smith, Bentham, Malthus, and Ricardo all claimed it created significant social costs and increased rather than reduced poverty. The Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834, drafted by Political Economists, cuts payments sharply. Because local rules on eligibility and provision varied greatly before the 1834 reform, we can estimate the social costs of the extensive welfare provision of the Old Poor Law. Surprisingly there is no evidence of any of the alleged social costs that prompted the harsh treatment of the poor after 1834.

"Clay, Karen; Schmick, Ethan; Troesken, Werner";Focusing on the first half of the twentieth century, we explore the rise and fall of pellagra (a disease caused by inadequate niacin consumption) in the American South. We first consider the hypothesis that the South’s monoculture in cotton undermined nutrition by displacing local food production. Consistent with this hypothesis, a difference in differences estimation shows that after the arrival of the boll weevil, food production in affected counties rose while cotton production and pellagra rates fell. The results also suggest that after 1937 improved medical understanding and state fortification laws helped eliminate pellagra.;2019;The Rise and Fall of Pellagra in the American South;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
COLLANTES, FERNANDO;The rise of a mass, agri-industrial diet after the Second World War was crucial for the culmination of the nutritional transition that western countries had been involved in since the second half of the nineteenth century?but why did the industrial diet triumph? This article takes the massification of dairy consumption in Spain 1965?90 as a study case. Using a newly constructed database and qualitative material within an evolutionary socio-economic framework, the article reaches two conclusions. First, the massification of dairy consumption was linked to most households? transition to a softer budget constraint, which was driven mainly by increasing household incomes (and only secondarily by consumer price reductions caused by food industrialization). Second, the reason why the softening of the budget constraint played such a major role was that it was joined by a substantial increase in consumer trust in dairy products, which in turn resulted from industrial standardization. The article is in line with recent work that underlines the dietary change brought about by food industrialization, but questions whether the latter's major contribution was of a quantitative, price-related nature and suggests that more attention should be paid to the qualitative, preferences-related dimension.;2019;Why did the industrial diet triumph?

"Collins, William J.; Niemesh, Gregory T.";This article tests whether places with higher exposure to unionization during the 1940s, due to their pre-existing industrial composition, tended to have larger declines in wage inequality, conditional on local economic and demographic observables and regional trends. We find a strong negative correlation between exposure to unionization and changes in local inequality from 1940?50 and 1940?60. This does not appear to be underpinned by skill-specific sorting of workers or by firms leaving places with high exposure to unionization. We also find that the correlation between exposure to unionization in the 1940s and the change in inequality after 1940 persists in long-difference regressions to the end of the twentieth century.;2019;Unions and the Great Compression of wage inequality in the US at mid-century: evidence from local labour markets;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Collins, William J.; Zimran, Ariell";The repeated failure of Ireland's potato crop in the late 1840s led to a major famine and sparked a surge in migration to the US. We build a new dataset of Irish immigrants and their sons by linking males from 1850 to 1880 US census records. For comparison, we also link German and British immigrants, their sons, and males from US native-headed households. We document a decline in the observable human capital of famine-era Irish migrants compared to pre-famine Irish migrants and to other groups in the 1850 census, as well as worse labor market outcomes. The disparity in labor market outcomes persists into the next generation when immigrants’ and natives’ sons are compared in 1880. Nonetheless, we find strong evidence of intergenerational convergence in that famine-era Irish sons experienced a much smaller gap in occupational status in 1880 than their fathers did in 1850. The disparities are even smaller when the Irish children are compared to those from observationally similar native white households. A descriptive analysis of mobility for the children of the famine Irish indicates that having a more Catholic surname and being born in Ireland were associated with less upward mobility. Our results contribute to literatures on immigrant assimilation, refugee migration, and the Age of Mass Migration.;2019;The economic assimilation of Irish Famine migrants to the United States;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Connor, Dylan Shane;With more than 30 million people moving to North America during the Age of Mass Migration (1850–1913), governments feared that Europe was losing its most talented workers. Using new data from Ireland in the early twentieth century, I provide evidence to the contrary, showing that the sons of farmers and illiterate men were more likely to emigrate than their literate and skilled counterparts. Emigration rates were highest in poorer farming communities with stronger migrant networks. I constructed these data using new name-based techniques to follow people over time and to measure chain migration from origin communities to the United States.;2019;The Cream of the Crop?

"Cutsinger, Bryan P.; Ingber, Joshua S.";During the U.S. Civil War, the Confederate Congress adopted three currency reforms that were intended to reduce the quantity of Treasury notes in circulation by inducing the money-holding public to exchange their notes for long-term bonds. In this paper, we examine the political factors that influenced the adoption of the reforms and their effect on the flow of seigniorage - revenue that the government derived by using the newly-printed Treasury notes to purchase the goods and services it required. We argue that the bifurcation of the Confederate Congress into two groups – those legislators that represented the Confederacy's interior and those from areas no longer under Confederate control – contributed to the adoption of the reforms. Our findings indicate that representing an area outside of the rebel government's control increased the likelihood that a legislator would support efforts to reform the currency by over 90 percent. In addition, our results indicate that the rate of monetary expansion in the South was below that which would have maximized the revenue from seigniorage. We find that the reforms reduced the flow of seigniorage by approximately 57 percent, depriving the Confederate government of much-needed revenue.;2019;Seigniorage in the Civil War South;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Cvrcek, Tomas; Zajicek, Miroslav";The rise of mass schooling is an important contributor to modern economic growth. But its form, content, scale and manner of provision are all matters of public policy. The rise of modern schooling is frequently cast as a product of broadened suffrage and stronger political voice of the masses, which overcame the political opposition from old ruling elites. We investigate this hypothesis, using the case of a school reform undertaken in Imperial Austria in 1869. We show that large landowners were mildly in favor of school modernization, albeit less than urban and business interests. The strongest opposition came from the rural areas where the suffrage was in fact most numerous. The reform passed in spite of their opposition but, interestingly, post-reform developments suggest that passive resistance to it continued in the countryside in spite of the alleged benefits that education was billed to bring the masses.;2019;The making of a liberal education: Political economy of the Austrian school reform, 1865 – 1880;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Depauw, Ewout; Oxley, Deborah";Does adult stature capture conditions at birth or at some other stage in the growth cycle? Anthropometrics is lauded as a method for capturing net nutritional status over all the growing years. However, it is frequently assumed that conditions at birth were most influential. Was this true for historical populations? This article examines the heights of Flemish men born between 1800 and 1876 to tease apart which moments of growth were most sensitive to disruption and reflected in final heights. It exploits two proximate crises in 1846?9 and 1853?6 as shocks that permit age effects to be revealed. These are affirmed through a study of food prices and death rates. Both approaches suggest a shift of the critical moment away from the first few years of life and towards the adolescent growth spurt as the most influential on terminal stature. Furthermore, just as height is accumulated over the growing years, conditions influencing growth need to be understood cumulatively. Economic conditions at the time of birth were not explanatory, but their collective effects from ages 11 to 18 years were strongly influential. At these ages, both health and nutrition mattered, to varying degrees. Teenagers, rather than toddlers, should be our guides to the past.;2019;Toddlers, teenagers, and terminal heights: the importance of puberty for male adult stature, Flanders, 1800–76;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
DEVEREUX, JOHN;Puerto Rico became an American colony in 1898, achieving self-rule after the Great Depression.

I show these claims are mistaken. Using a new GDP index for 1900 to 1940, I show that income per capita grew at impressive rates during direct American rule and Puerto Rico escaped the worst ravages of the Great Depression. In addition, I find the recent growth slowdown is partly a statistical artifact.;2019;Arrested Development? Puerto Rico in an American Century;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Donges, Alexander; Selgert, Felix";This article analyses the spread of innovation in mid-nineteenth-century Germany using foreign patents as an indicator for technology transfer. It introduces a new dataset of over 1,400 patents granted in the Grand Duchy of Baden between 1843 and 1877. The data show that Baden's technology import via foreign patents from German and non-German inventors was important. This technology transfer was broadly based, although technologies related to the textile and machine-building industries are prominent in the data. The decision to file a patent in Baden was driven by competition and the risk of imitation. Using a gravity model with city-level data, we find evidence that technology transfer through patents reflected existing trade links. The strong correlation between technologies filed by foreigners and domestic inventors provides further evidence that the risk of imitation fostered patent-based technology transfer during the mid-nineteenth century. Furthermore, we show that foreigners filed patents predominantly in industries that accounted for a high share of the workforce in Baden.;2019;Technology transfer via foreign patents in Germany, 1843–77;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The censuses 1880–1900 have been linked at the individual level, enabling us to follow almost 100,000 women from their parental home to their new marital household. Marriage market imbalances were not an important push factor for migration but we find a strong association between migration distance and marriage outcomes, both in terms of overall marriage probabilities and in terms of partner selection by SES.

Dupraz, Yannick;Cameroon was partitioned between France and the United Kingdom after WWI and then reunited after independence. I use this natural experiment to investigate colonial legacies in education, using a border discontinuity analysis of historical census microdata from 1976. I find that men born in the decades following partition had, all else equal, one more year of schooling if they were born in the British part. This positive British effect disappeared after 1950, as the French increased education expenditure, and because of favoritism in school supply towards the Francophone side after reunification. Using 2005 census microdata, I find that the British advantage resurfaced more recently: Cameroonians born after 1970 are more likely to finish high school, attend a university, and have a high-skilled occupation if they were born in the former British part. I explain this result by the legacy of high grade repetition rates in the French-speaking education system and their detrimental effect on dropout.;2019;French and British Colonial Legacies in Education: Evidence from the Partition of Cameroon;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The historical income distribution of this region is relatively unknown, despite it having on of the highest urbanization rates in Europe in the pre-industrial era.

We then use this income information to conduct analyses of the income distribution in the 1730s and 1780s using censuses with information about the occupational distribution.

FELICE, EMANUELE;The article discusses the new series of services GDP for Italy (1861–1951), which have been incorporated in the Italian historical accounts. Three main results emerge. First, the new historical estimates of services appear to be more reliable than the previous ones, published by Istat (Indagine statistica sullo sviluppo del reddito nazionale dell’Italia dal 1861 al 1956. Annali di Statistica, Istat, Rome, 1957). Second, the differences between the estimates of services make up for most of the differences observed between the old GDP series and the new one, and they have a significant impact on the performance of the Italian economy, also in international comparisons. Third, cointegration analysis suggests the presence of a significant break at the end of the nineteenth century, in line with industry: since then, the traditional services lagged behind, while the innovative ones (and since the Great War also social/collective services) shared the same rising trend as industry. This result confirms the idea of a «great transformation» of the Italian economy, first pioneered by Gerschenkron, which began at the end of the nineteenth century arguably as a consequence of institutional and political changes.;2019;Rethinking the take-off: the role of services in the new economic history of Italy (1861–1951);Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The London Stock Exchange welcomed young, old, domestic, and foreign firms. It provided funds to firms in old, existing industries as well as patenting firms in ?new-tech? industries at similar costs of capital. If investors did show a preference for older and foreign firms, it was because those firms offered investors better long-run performance.

"Gallais-Hamonno, Georges; Hoang, Thi-Hong-Van; Oosterlinck, Kim";Because of the scarcity of data, there are few quantitative analyses dealing with clandestine markets, despite their prime importance during wartime. This article exploits a unique database of daily prices of gold coins traded in occupied Paris in order to gain insights into the price formation on such a market. First, using data from Switzerland, we show that arbitrage took place, despite the costs and risks involved, and led to a gradual (but incomplete) convergence of gold prices. Furthermore, a study of price seasonality reveals that less strict borders controls during the weekends made the volatility of returns higher at the start of the following week. Second, on the basis of an event study, we provide evidence that laws related to black markets did not have a significant impact on the gold price, except for the most severe law passed on 8 June 1943 which greatly increased the sentences for involvement. Finally, we assess whether the so-called coin premiums existed on this clandestine market, and show that the large price variations for one gram of fine gold contained in different coins were due to market participants? preferences for specific gold coins.;2019;Price formation on clandestine markets: the case of the Paris gold market during the Second World War;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Gallardo-Albarrán, Daniel;GDP suggests that the period 1913–1950 is one of missed opportunities for improving living standards in Europe. However, life in Europe during these years improved significantly, as citizens experienced dramatic declines in mortality, working time and inequality. To measure the contribution of these aspects to broader welfare, I apply a new theoretically-grounded indicator that, contrary to previous measures used in the literature, allows for a direct comparison with GDP across countries and time. I find that income underestimates welfare growth significantly (up to 2.2 percent annually) and that cross-country differences are larger and more persistent than other welfare measures imply. This article calls for a reappraisal of the evolution of living standards during the period 1913–1950 and, more generally, presents an application of a new indicator to measure multi-dimensional welfare in historical contexts.;2019;Missed opportunities?

"Galofré Vilà, Gregori; Meissner, Christopher M.; McKee, Martin; Stuckler, David";The London Debt Agreement (LDA) eliminated half of West Germany’s external debt. Subsequent years witnessed unprecedented economic growth. The LDA likely contributed to economic growth by creating fiscal space for public investment and social spending, restoring the full convertibility of the Deutsche Mark, and stabilising inflation. The LDA was associated with a substantial and statistically significant rise in real per capita social expenditure relative to other spending categories. Synthetic control methods also show that under the counterfactual of no debt relief, overall expenditure might have been lower by 17 percent. The LDA also facilitated the reintegration of Germany into global markets and full convertibility of the Deutsche Mark by catalysing accumulation of sufficient US-Dollar reserves.;2019;The economic consequences of the 1953 London Debt Agreement;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Gómez León, María; Jong, Herman J. de";Using social tables, this article provides new data on inequality in Germany and Britain on an annual basis for the first half of the twentieth century. Inequality trends in these two countries tended to follow opposite patterns. The decline in inequality in Germany was interrupted during the First World War and the Nazi period, while in Britain the reversal took place between the end of the First World War and the Great Depression. Results show that the drop in inequality during the twentieth century in Europe did not follow secular trends, thus supporting the notion of inequality cycles.;2019;Inequality in turbulent times: income distribution in Germany and Britain, 1900–50;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Gómez-Tello, Alicia; Díez-Minguela, Alfonso; Martinez-Galarraga, Julio; Tirado, Daniel A.";This paper explores regional price variation in early twentieth-century Spain. Using consumer price information from the bulletins published by the Instituto de Reformas Sociales between 1910 and 1920, we build a dataset with a total of 40,581 quotes covering 22 items for each of the 49 provinces. We then estimate provincial price levels following a country-product-dummy (CPD) approach. Our findings suggest that spatial price variation existed across Spanish provinces. In line with the Balassa–Samuelson conjecture, consumer prices and productivity levels were somewhat related. Additionally, it is shown that prices rose in all provinces after the outbreak of World War I. Even more, it appears that this demand-shock brought about spatial asymmetries in price growth.;2019;Regional prices in early twentieth-century Spain: a country-product-dummy approach;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
GRÁDA, CORMAC Ó.;Ireland on the eve of the Great Famine was a poor and backward economy. The Great Irish Famine of the 1840s is accordingly often considered the classic example of Malthusian population economics in action. However, unlike most historical famines, the Great Famine was not the product of a harvest shortfall, but of a major ecological disaster. Because there could be no return to the status quo ante, textbook famine relief in the form of public works or food aid was not enough. Fortunately, in an era of open borders mass emigration helped contain excess mortality, subject to the limitation that the very poorest could not afford to leave. In general, the authorities did not countenance publicly assisted migration. This article discusses the lessons to be learned from two exceptional schemes for assisting destitute emigrants during and in the wake of the famine.;2019;The Next World and the New World: Relief, Migration, and the Great Irish Famine;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Gray, Rowena; Narciso, Gaia; Tortorici, Gaspare";Despite the significant attention paid to the current consequences of globalization for migration behavior, there are few historical accounts of the effect of commodity market integration at the local level. We set our paper within the context of the first globalization era, when migration flows were largely unregulated, and highlight how exogenous shocks in agricultural commodity prices influenced international migration flows from Italian provinces between 1881 and 1912. To do this, we construct an index of global price exposure based on the initial provincial agricultural production structures. Our analysis quantifies the contribution of globalization-induced agricultural-price shocks to migration decisions, alongside more traditional explanatory factors such as migrant networks and landholding systems. We find evidence that agricultural-price shocks are positively related to the propensity to migrate, as migration tended to increase in proportion with agricultural commodity prices. This result suggests that liquidity constraints were binding until agricultural incomes reached a certain threshold. These findings can inform our understanding of present-day migration responses in developing countries in the face of even more rapid globalization but higher barriers to legal migration.;2019;Globalization, agricultural markets and mass migration: Italy, 1881–1912;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Greenwald, Diana Seave;This article proposes a novel interdisciplinary approach to the economic history of art. Engaging with research questions defined by the existing art-historical literature, it draws on econometric approaches to understand better and measure how social and economic change affected artistic output?particularly output of rural imagery?in nineteenth-century France. To facilitate this quantitative approach, the article introduces a novel data source that provides information about more than 140,000 works of art displayed in Paris during the nineteenth century. Analysis of this dataset demonstrates that artists? ability to have regular access to the countryside, largely because of artists? colonies and inexpensive train travel from Paris, had the greatest demonstrable effect on the output of landscape and rural genre painting in France during the nineteenth century.;2019;Modernization and rural imagery at the Paris Salon: an interdisciplinary approach to the economic history of art;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Gregg, Amanda G.; Nafziger, Steven";This article investigates the financing of corporations in industrialization’s early stages by examining new balance sheet data describing all Imperial Russian corporations in 1914. We emphasize differences between two Russian corporation types: share partnerships and A-corporations. Share partnerships issued greater dividends, were less likely to issue bonds, and had larger accounts payable. We find that capital structures varied with age, size, and sector according to modern corporate finance theories and that scaled profits did not demonstrate differential market power across corporation types. Thus, Russian corporations exhibited considerable financial flexibility, and reducing incorporation costs could have benefited the Imperial Russian economy.;2019;Capital structure and corporate performance in late Imperial Russia;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Henderson, Stuart;Over a century ago, Horace Plunkett began a debate about the role of religion in Irish development, pointing to what he saw as the economic shortcomings of Roman Catholicism. Thereafter, however, the debate waned, and only limited scholarship has subsequently investigated the significance of religion in Irish development, especially in statistical terms. In this article that lacuna is addressed, using a quantitative approach to examine the relationship between Roman Catholicism and economic and financial development in the post-Famine era. Attention is directed to a variety of development indicators, namely, education, occupations, and commerce. By focusing on a selection of measures over time, it is possible to determine more precisely where differences, if any, occurred between the denominations and whether such differences changed over the period. The analysis reveals that Roman Catholicism tends to be initially negatively associated with more advanced development outcomes, but that this association weakens over time. As such, the results point to an economic convergence between Roman Catholics and Protestants, complementing historical evidence on an upward Catholic socioeconomic transition?a ?Catholic embourgeoisement??in the post-Famine era.;2019;Religion and development in post-Famine Ireland;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Ho, Tai-kuang; Yeh, Kuo-chun";This paper examines the role of capital flows in the interwar German economy. We use a calibrated model of sudden stops as our analytical framework and derive four key findings. First, capital flows aggravated the boom–bust cycle of the Weimar economy. Second, these flows were strongly associated—during different periods—with reparations, conditions in the US capital market, and German domestic events. Third, capital flows before 1930 allowed Germany to pay reparations on credit and thus postponed the hour of reckoning when that debt had to be serviced using trade surpluses. Fourth, the German economic downturn in 1931 was due more to capital flows than to productivity shocks or reparations.;2019;Were capital flows the culprit in the Weimar economic crisis?;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Hornung, Erik;Diversity may either increase economic activity by utilizing complementarities in production or lead to costly conflict over resources. Using city-district panel data from 18th-century Berlin, a major center of refuge for persecuted minorities in early modern Europe, we analyze the relationship between changes in diversity and economic activity. Prussian rulers specifically invited groups of skilled immigrants, such as Jews, Huguenots, and Bohemians, to settle in Berlin’s newly-developed city quarters. We find that the resulting ethnic diversity fosters textile production in a much broader range of products than individual ethnicities, arguably reflecting complementarities between groups.;2019;Diasporas, diversity, and economic activity: Evidence from 18th-century Berlin;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Huff, Gregg;This article analyses Vietnam's 1944?5 great famine, which, even beyond its sheer scale of a million deaths, is historically important as instrumental in the August 1945 Viet Minh and communist revolution. It is argued that typhoons which struck coastal areas resulted in a shortfall of available food and were the proximate cause of famine. The Japanese in occupation of Vietnam, the American government directing attacks on the transport system, or the country's French colonial administration could have acted to limit, or even reverse, the famine. However, under the pressure of war, no government or institution opted for an effective famine alleviation strategy. That was also true of Asia's other great Second World War famines in Bengal, Henan, and Java, which paralleled Vietnam's both in causation and in feasible avoidance strategies. In Vietnam, differences in endowments and entitlements largely explain who died in the famine.;2019;Causes and consequences of the Great Vietnam Famine, 1944–5;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Humphries, Jane; Schneider, Benjamin";The prevailing explanation for why the industrial revolution occurred first in Britain during the last quarter of the eighteenth century is Allen's ?high wage economy? view, which claims that the high cost of labour relative to capital and fuel incentivized innovation and the adoption of new techniques. This article presents new empirical evidence on hand spinning before the industrial revolution and demonstrates that there was no such ?high wage economy? in spinning, which was a leading sector of industrialization. We quantify the working lives of frequently ignored female and child spinners who were crucial to the British textile industry with evidence of productivity and wages from the late sixteenth to the early nineteenth century. Spinning emerges as a widespread, low-productivity, low-wage employment, in which wages did not rise substantially in advance of the introduction of the jenny and water frame. The motivation for mechanization must be sought elsewhere.;2019;Spinning the industrial revolution;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

This article uses the earthquake as a case study to inform our understanding of the economics of disasters and the history of market integration.

We make use of a unique monthly wholesale price dataset for a number of cities across Japan, and our analysis suggests three main findings: that price changes in the affected areas immediately following the disaster were in most cases reflected in price changes in Japan's provincial cities; that cities further away from the devastation witnessed smaller price changes than those nearer to the affected area; and that the observed pattern of price changes reflects the regional heterogeneity identified by scholars who have worked on market integration in Japan.";2019;Price shocks in regional markets: Japan's Great Kantō Earthquake of 1923;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Inwood, Kris; Minns, Chris; Summerfield, Fraser";Little evidence is available to assess the effect of substituting occupation-based income scores for individual incomes before 1940. The example of immigrant assimilation in Canada 1911–31 reveals differences in the extent and even the direction of assimilation depending on whether income scores are used and how the occupational income score is constructed. Given the increasingly wide use of income scores, we summarize a number of procedures to address the limitations associated with the absence of individual level income variation. An adjustment of conventional income scores for either group earnings differences and/or intertemporal change using summary information for broad groups of occupations reduces the deviation between scores and actual incomes.;2019;Occupational income scores and immigrant assimilation.

The main findings can be summarized as follows: (1) real commodity prices have been on the rise—albeit modestly—from 1950; (2) there is a pattern—in both past and present—of commodity price cycles, entailing large and long-lived deviations from underlying trends; (3) these commodity price cycles are themselves punctuated by boom/bust episodes which are historically pervasive.";2019;From boom to bust: a typology of real commodity prices in the long run;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Jaramillo-Echeverri, Juliana; Meisel-Roca, Adolfo; Ramírez-Giraldo, María Teresa";We examine the long-term trends observed in the living standard of the Colombian population over more than 180 years. We construct a Historical Index of Human Development (HIHD) for Colombia for the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and find modest advances in the index during the nineteenth century, life expectancy being the dimension that contributed most to the Colombian Human Development Index in that century. In contrast, all HIHD components exhibited significant advances during the twentieth century. In particular, social dimensions were the main contributors to a growing Human Development Index in Colombia, and life expectancy was the main driver for both men and women. These achievements are mainly explained by the role of public policies aimed at the improvement of education and health. Next, since life expectancy was the dimension that most contributed to human development in the long run, we empirically examine the role of improvements in the provision of public utilities in the significant reduction of mortality. Our hypothesis is that the reduction of mortality was largely brought about by improvements in the provision of aqueducts and sewerage. To this end, we construct a new dataset using statistics reported by the Colombian government, which included annual information on the main diseases and causes of mortality during the 1916–2014 period disaggregated by departments. Econometric results show that the decline in mortality rates, especially those related to some waterborne diseases, was significantly related to the expansion of aqueducts and sewerage services in the country.;2019;More than 100 years of improvements in living standards: the case of Colombia;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Kelly, Morgan; Ó Gráda, Cormac";This article measures technological progress in oceanic shipping directly by using a large database of daily log entries from British, Dutch, and Spanish ships to estimate daily sailing speed in different wind conditions from 1750 to 1850. Against the consensus among economic (but not maritime) historians that the technology of sailing ships was fairly static during this time, we find that average sailing speeds of British East India Company and Navy ships in moderate to strong winds rose considerably after the 1770s. Driving this progress was the introduction of coppering in the 1780s, but subsequent rises are probably due to a continuous evolution of sails and rigging, and improved hulls that allowed a greater area of sail to be set safely in a given wind. By contrast, the speeds of Dutch and Spanish vessels were stagnant. Using separate data on the crossing times of Atlantic mail packets, we find gradual progress from the 1750s, followed by marked improvements when American packets appeared in the 1820s.;2019;Speed under sail during the early industrial revolution (c. 1750–1830);The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Kobayashi, Atsushi;This study reveals the mechanism underlying the silver trade in Singapore during the third quarter of the nineteenth century by analysing banking business and bullion arbitrage. After 1849, the California Gold Rush induced gold depreciation and silver appreciation in Singapore's bullion market, and arbitrage profits for silver imports from Britain emerged. At the same time, the expansion of banking business by eastern exchange banks enhanced the connectivity of Singapore's exchange market with London, and enabled bullion arbitrage between the two distant cities. As a result, there was an influx of silver from Britain. In addition, Dutch silver, which was exported to Java by the Netherlands after 1854, flowed into Singapore due to the unfavourable exchange policy of the Dutch government.;2019;International bimetallism and silver absorption in Singapore, 1840–73;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Korchmina, Elena; Fedyukin, Igor";"This article uses the records of expenditures from a set of estates that belonged to the Golitsyn family to assess the level of ?routine corruption? in Imperial Russia in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. The data from these books allow us to identify individual cases of unofficial facilitation payments made by the estates and by peasant communes to district-level officials; to delimit key types of payment situations; and to calculate the sums expended for payments by a given estate in a given year. The resulting numbers are compared to the overall volume of obligations borne by the serfs to the state and to their landlords. Our conclusion is that while the facilitation payments were ubiquitous and accompanied any interaction with the state, the volume of these ?routine? payments (as opposed to other forms of extraction) was quite low and they did not put a significant burden on the peasants, while at the same time securing hefty extra incomes for top district officials. Rather, by the last decades of the eighteenth century Russian Imperial officials at the district level might have switched from a tribute-like extortion from the population at large to acquiring vast sums by collecting unofficial payments in more targeted ways.";2019;Extralegal payments to state officials in Russia, 1750s–1830s: assessing the burden of corruption;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Kosmetatos, Paul;Claims that the Bank of England began to act as a Lender of Last Resort as early as the mid-eighteenth century date back to Adam Smith and Henry Thornton. This article presents evidence on the Bank’s financial market interventions during the 1763 and 1772–1773 crises, and concludes that although the former was too gradual to be truly representative of last resort lending by 1772 the means of intervention described by Thornton were largely in place. Although direct evidence for the Bank’s decision making process on either occasion is lacking, the universal contemporary conviction of its unique resources and obligations make it unlikely that it was entirely motivated by political considerations or cronyism. Its actions are instead consistent with Thornton’s crisis containment narrative of banknote loans to London bankers, which in turn was the optimal response for containing financial contagion by ensuring the continued health of the bills of exchange network.;2019;Last resort lending before Henry Thornton?

Lie, Einar;In the mid-twentieth century a number of central banks around the western world lost their operational autonomy and were placed under government control. The origin of these policy changes can be traced to the intellectual and political developments of the interwar era in addition to the introduction of the Bretton Woods monetary system. The Norwegian central bank offers a particularly stark example of this phenomenon: experiencing a rapid decline from its high level of autonomy in the interwar years, to a clear subordination to the government after 1945. Through an analysis of the correspondence between the main policy makers in the exiled Norwegian government and central bank management, this article contributes to the understanding of central bank autonomy by tracing the decisive factors that led to the Norwegian central bank's loss of agency.;2019;Losing autonomy: the Norwegian central bank during the Second World War;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The results show that the Great Contraction of 1929–1933 and the Second-Dip Recession still had powerful negative effects on county labor markets in 1939/1940 and these were only partially offset by public works grants. Relief grants had somewhat negative effects although this might have arisen because of a large layoff of workers by the WPA in 1939. The AAA payments to farmers to take land out of production were associated with lower earnings and private employment, but had mixed effects on skill mobility.;2019;Effects of New Deal Spending and the downturns of the 1930s on private labor markets in 1939/1940;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Malinowski, Mikołaj;With use of innovative proxies and new annual data, I demonstrate that relatively high legal capacity and regulatory activity of the early-modern Polish parliament, the Seym, was positively associated with deeper domestic commodity market integration. Conversely, the lack of effective law-making, caused by the right of a single delegate to discontinue the Seym’s sessions, fostered market fragmentation. This indicates that early parliamentary regimes required legal capacity to harmonize domestic institutions and reduce the transaction costs. The Polish case suggests a hypothesis that the pre-1800 “Little Divergence” between European parliamentary regimes could be explained by differences in their governments’ capacities.;2019;Economic Consequences of State Failure—Legal Capacity, Regulatory Activity, and Market Integration in Poland, 1505–1772;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Meyer, Patrick; Ponthiere, Gregory";This paper uses Shannon’s entropy index to the base 2 to quantify the risk relative to the age at death in terms of bits (i.e. the amount of information revealed by tossing a fair coin).

Then, using data on 37 countries from the Human Mortality Database, we show that, over the last two centuries, (period) lifetime entropy at birth has exhibited, in all countries, an inverted-U shape pattern with a maximum in the first half of the twentieth century (at 6 bits), and reaches, in the early twenty-first century, 5.6 bits for men and 5.5 bits for women.

Missiaia, Anna;This article aims to explain the location of the manufacturing industries in Italy in the period 1871–1911. The analytical framework takes into account of two competing theories on the determinants of the location of economic activity: the Heckscher–Ohlin (H–O) theory on factor endowments and the new economic geography (NEG) theory on access to markets. The methodology used here is based on Midelfart-Knarvik et al. (The location of European industry, European Economy Economic Papers 142. European Commission, 2000) and has seen several historical applications. The location of industries is explained through interactions between characteristics of the regions and characteristics of the sectors, of both H–O type and NEG type. The main finding is that endowments, and in particular energy and human capital, were the determinants of the geography of the first Italian industrialization. Market access, at this point of industrialization, mattered only in its domestic formulation and only through economies of scale.;2019;Market versus endowment: explaining early industrial location in Italy (1871–1911);Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Molinder, Jakob;The Swedish model has been seen as way to combine rapid growth with small wage gaps. The solidaristic wage policy negotiated by peak organizations between 1956 and 1983 was designed to induce restructuring by reducing wage differences across the economy. Several authors have linked this to decreased wage dispersion and rapid structural change, especially during the 1960s. However, there is disagreement on when the policy started to affect dispersion and little evidence exist before the 1970s. Using new wage data, I examine differentials using a regression–decomposition framework. The results show that inequality was stable before the late-1960s but declined rapidly thereafter. According to the decomposition, the decline in the 1970s was the likely result of deliberate union policy while developments in the 1960s were unrelated to union action. In contrast to what some authors have argued, this study shows that decreased wage dispersion coincided with a fall in growth and structural change.;2019;Wage differentials, economic restructuring and the solidaristic wage policy in Sweden;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

While price gaps generally decreased during the period, progress in efficiency was limited to a small group of cities. We suggest that convergence was associated to the reduction in transaction costs, which started well before the railways through improvements in roads and postal services. By contrast, the heterogeneous behavior of efficiency might be associated to economic geography changes and their effects on monetary leadership.;2019;The Making of a National Currency: Spatial Transaction Costs and Money Market Integration in Spain (1825–1874);The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

While a growing body of the literature has revealed the mitigating effects of water-purification facilities on diseases, the heterogeneous treatment effects of clean water have been understudied. The present study thus focuses on the treatment effect heterogeneity of piped water with respect to the external meteorological environment of cities in industrializing Japan. To estimate the varying effects, we implement fixed-effects semivarying coefficient models to deal with the unobservable confounding factors, using a nationwide city-level panel dataset between 1922 and 1940. We find evidence that the magnitude of safe water on the reduction in the typhoid death rate is larger in cities with a higher temperature, which is consistent with recent epidemiological evidence. These findings underscore the importance of the variations in the external meteorological conditions of the municipalities that install water-purification facilities in developing countries.;2019;Heterogeneous treatment effects of safe water on infectious disease: Do meteorological factors matter?;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"OKAZAKI, TETSUJI; Okubo, Toshihiro; Strobl, Eric";The Great Kanto Earthquake occurred on 1 September 1923 and inflicted serious damage on Yokohama City. About 90 percent of the factories in Yokohama City were burnt down or completely destroyed. However, these manufacturing industries appear to have swiftly recovered in the aftermath of the damage. This article investigates the role of creative destruction due to the Great Kanto Earthquake. Using firm-level data on capital (horsepower of motors) before and after the earthquake, we find substantial creative destruction, that is, upgrade of machine technology and/or survival of efficient firms. We find further collaborating evidence of this at the prefecture level.;2019;Creative Destruction of Industries: Yokohama City in the Great Kanto Earthquake, 1923;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Palma, Nuno; REIS, JAIME";We construct the first time-series for Portugal’s per capita GDP for 1527–1850, drawing on a new database. Starting in the early 1630s there was a highly persistent upward trend which accelerated after 1710 and peaked 40 years later. At that point, per capita income was high by European standards, though behind the most advanced Western European economies. But as the second half of the eighteenth century unfolded, a phase of economic decline was initiated. This continued into the nineteenth century, and by 1850 per capita incomes were not different from what they had been in the early 1530s.;2019;From Convergence to Divergence: Portuguese Economic Growth, 1527–1850;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Panza, Laura; Williamson, Jeffrey G.";Compared with its competitors, Australian GDP per worker grew exceptionally quickly from the 1820s to the 1870s, at a rate about twice that of the US and three times that of Britain. Did this rapid growth produce rising inequality, following a Kuznets curve? Using a novel dataset, this article offers new evidence that provides unambiguous support for the view that, in sharp contrast with the US experience and with globalization-inequality views concerning late nineteenth-century frontiers, Australia underwent a revolutionary levelling in incomes up to the 1870s. This assessment is based on trends in many proxies for inequality, as well as annual estimates of functional income shares in the form of land rents, convict payments, free unskilled labour incomes, free skilled labour and white collar incomes, British imperial transfers, and a capitalist residual.;2019;Australian squatters, convicts, and capitalists: dividing up a fast-growing frontier pie, 1821–71;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"PEARSON, ROBIN; RICHARDSON, DAVID";One important, but overlooked, risk mitigation device that facilitated the growth of the slave trade in the eighteenth century was the increasing availability of insurance for ships and their human cargoes. In this article we explore, for the first time, the relative cost of insurance for British slave traders, the underlying processes by which this key aspect of the business of slavery was conducted, and the factors behind price and other changes over time. Comparisons are also drawn with the transatlantic slave trades of other nations. As well as analyzing the business of underwriting slave voyages, we have two other objectives. First, we explore the meaning of slave insurance from the perspective of those directly involved in the trade. Was it about insuring lives or goods? Second, we provide new estimates of the importance of the slave trade to U.K. marine insurance. Did the former drive the growth of the latter, as Joseph Inikori has claimed?;2019;Insuring the Transatlantic Slave Trade;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Pérez, Santiago;I compare rates of intergenerational occupational mobility across four countries in the late nineteenth century: 1869–1895 Argentina, 1850–1880 United States, 1851–1881 Britain, and 1865–1900 Norway. Argentina and the United States had similar levels of intergenerational mobility, and these levels were above those of Britain and Norway. These findings suggest that the higher mobility of nineteenth-century United States relative to Britain might not have been a reflection of “American exceptionalism,” but rather a manifestation of more widespread differences between settler economies of the New World and Europe.;2019;Intergenerational Occupational Mobility across Three Continents;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Persaud, Alexander;Of the millions of Indians who migrated internationally in the long nineteenth century, over one million went as indentured servants in a massive South-South migration. I test how price volatility in origin markets in India affected out-migration under indentureship contracts from 1873–1916 to four major destinations around the world. Using new, unique district-level flows calculated from roughly 250,000 individual records, I show that indentureship take-up is consistent with migrating to escape local price volatility.;2019;Escaping Local Risk by Entering Indentureship: Evidence from Nineteenth-Century Indian Migration;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Pinilla, Vicente; Rayes, Agustina";The objective of this paper is to explain, from a cliometric perspective, the determinants of the growth of Argentina’s exports between 1880 and 1929. To do this, we have constructed a gravity model with the principal products exported each year by Argentina to its most important trading partners. In this way, we believe that this study constitutes a relevant and original contribution to the analysis of economic growth from a historical perspective and specifically in explaining the factors determining the export success of the settler countries during the first wave of globalisation. Our results show that Argentina’s export-led growth must be explained from both the supply and demand sides. We also find that the reduction in trade costs and trade liberalisation, especially the latter, boosted exports. We also support the idea that Argentina had a successful agro-export sector because it offered a diverse basket of products to the different European and American countries that consumed them. To sum up, we can conclude that Argentina took advantage of a multilateral and open economic system. Within this context, the country generally found a demand for its supply, which constitutes the key to explaining the magnitude and speed of Argentina’s export growth.;2019;How Argentina became a super-exporter of agricultural and food products during the First Globalisation (1880–1929);Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Quinn, Stephen; Roberds, William";This article describes and measures how the Bank of Amsterdam supplied a successful fiat money in a world of specie by offering the unlimited repo of large coins at a near-zero rate. Our data from 1736 to 1791 finds that such liberal access led to volatile loan levels and that the Bank responded with sterilization by means of open market operations. In this way, the Bank held its money stock at a roughly constant level and helped stabilize its value. Profit was another part of the Bank’s policy framework, and the pursuit of seigniorage eventually compromised stabilization.;2019;A Policy Framework for the Bank of Amsterdam, 1736–1791;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Quinn, William;This article examines the extent to which Victorian investors were short-sale constrained. While previous research suggests that there were relatively few limits on arbitrage, this article argues that short-sales of stocks outside the Official List were indirectly constrained by the risk of being cornered. Evidence for this hypothesis comes from three corners in cycle company shares which occurred in 1896?7, two of which resulted in substantial losses for short-sellers. Legal efforts to retrieve funds lost in a corner were unsuccessful, and the court proceedings reveal a widespread contempt for short-sellers, or ?bears?, among the general public. Consistent with the hypothesis that these episodes affected the market, this study's findings show that cycle companies for which cornering risk was greater experienced disproportionately lower returns during a subsequent crash in the market for cycle shares. This evidence suggests that, under certain circumstances, short-selling shares in Britain prior to 1900 could have been much riskier than previously thought.;2019;Squeezing the bears: cornering risk and limits on arbitrage during the ‘British bicycle mania’, 1896–8;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Ridolfi, Leonardo;Evidence of an early modern “Little divergence” in real wages between northwestern Europe and the rest of the continent is mostly based on the comparative study of a sample of leading European cities. Focusing on France and England this study reassesses the debate from a country-level perspective. The findings challenge the notion of an early modern divergence pointing to the coexistence of both divergence and convergence phases until the eighteenth century. Results also suggest that the real wages of a significant share of the French male labor force were broadly on par with the levels prevailing in England before c.1750.;2019;Six Centuries of Real Wages in France from Louis IX to Napoleon III: 1250–1860;The Journal of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Rönnbäck, Klas; Theodoridis, Dimitrios";Agriculture has played a central role in Africa's long-term economic development. Previous research has argued that the low productivity of African economies has posed significant challenges to African efforts to produce an agricultural surplus or to develop commercial agriculture. Low agricultural productivity has also served as a key explanation for the transatlantic slave trade, on the basis that it was more profitable to export humans overseas than to grow and export produce. However, the field has suffered from a lack of comparable empirical evidence. This article contributes to this field by presenting quantitative data on historical land and labour productivity in Africa, from a case study of the agricultural productivity of Senegambia in the early nineteenth century. Focusing on five key crops, our results suggest that both land and labour productivity was lower in Senegambia than it was in all other parts of the world for which we have found comparable data. This article thus lends support to claims that stress ecological factors as one of the main determinants of Africa's historical development.;2019;African agricultural productivity and the transatlantic slave trade: evidence from Senegambia in the nineteenth century;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Roosen, Joris; Curtis, Daniel R.";"Although the fanciful notion that the Black Death bypassed the Low Countries has long been rejected, nevertheless a persistent view remains that the Low Countries experienced only a ?light touch? of the plague when placed in a broader European perspective, and recovered quickly and fully. However, in this article an array of dispersed sources for the Southern Netherlands together with a new mortmain accounts database for Hainaut show that the Black Death was severe, perhaps no less severe than other parts of western Europe; that serious plagues continued throughout the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries; and that the Black Death and recurring plagues spread over vast territories?including the countryside. The previous conception of a ?light touch? of plague in the Low Countries was created by the overprivileging of particular urban sources, and a failure to account for the rapid replenishment of cities via inward migration, which obscured demographic decimation. We suggest that the population of the Low Countries may not have recovered faster than other parts of western Europe but instead experienced a greater degree of post-plague rural?urban migration.";2019;The ‘light touch’ of the Black Death in the Southern Netherlands: an urban trick?;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Sabaté, Marcela; Fillat, Carmen; Escario, Regina";The sovereign debt crisis in the Eurozone has rekindled the use of the North–South (core-periphery) terminology to refer to the heterogeneity of countries belonging to the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). In the gold standard literature, this geographical partition had already been employed to oppose the fiscal profligacy and subsequent problems of convertibility of southern countries against the fiscal probity and long convertibility records of their northern counterparts. We provide statistical evidence that the group of countries that, with available data for 1870–1938, exhibited convertibility problems during the classical gold standard, for this reason called the pre-WWI “sometimes-floaters”, shared a pattern of fiscal dominance. This finding for the sometimes-floaters (southern European and South American countries plus Japan) differs from the non-fiscal dominance pattern that we obtain for the pre-WWI “never-floaters” (northern Europe and North America countries) when the Great War and its aftermath years are omitted. We also show that the presence of fiscal dominance was partly due to the lower levels of tax efficiency and political stability in the South.;2019;Budget deficits and money creation: Exploring their relation before Bretton Woods;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
SAPOZNIK, ALEXANDRA;The high and late middle ages saw a significant increase in demand for beeswax, a fundamental component of medieval Christian devotion, spurred by both changing socio-economic conditions and shifts in religious practice. The vast quantities of wax needed for churches and religious foundations in England drove a thriving international trade spanning from the hinterland of Novgorod to the port of Lisbon, while at the same time encouraging widespread domestic beekeeping. This article considers the impact of supply-side constraints and increasing demand on wax prices, calculating the cost and quantity of wax purchased by large foundations, parish churches, and individual offerings, to reveal the hitherto underexplored impact of religious consumption on the medieval economy.;2019;Bees in the medieval economy: religious observance and the production, trade, and consumption of wax in England, c. 1300–1555;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Sarada, Sarada; Andrews, Michael J.; Ziebarth, Nicolas L.";We assemble a novel dataset linking inventors listed in the Annual Reports of the Commissioner of Patents to Population Census records spanning 1870 to 1940. We find that inventors are not a random subset of the population. They differ in some unsurprising ways in that they tend to be older, whiter, and more likely male. However, these patterns do change over time. The odds ratio relative to the population as a whole of female inventors increases from a low of 0.07 in 1880 to a high of 0.13 in 1940 and that of non-whites ranges from 0.16 in 1880 to 0.34 in 1940. Both populations remain severely underrepresented throughout the timeframe. We find changes in the occupations of inventors with trends away from farming and towards white collar occupations. We also show the increasing importance of foreign born people in patenting. In 1870, the odds of a foreign born person patenting relative to the population as a whole is nearly 1 and increases to over 1.6 by 1940.;2019;Changes in the demographics of American inventors, 1870–1940;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Sarasua, Carmen;This article uses the declarations of householders in the Cadaster of Ensenada (1750?5) to calculate labour participation rates for women and men from 22 localities in inland Spain. The article establishes the actual levels of women's market activity, which are much higher than commonly assumed. This unique source also makes it possible to analyse the region's occupational structure. Due to the labour-intensive character of manufacturing work, the abundant supply of cheap labour, the diffusion of cottage industries, and the demand for commodities from internal and colonial markets, a large portion of the region's population worked in manufactures in the eighteenth century. This finding challenges standard interpretations of the Spanish economy at this time as mostly agricultural, which rely on sources that exclude women workers. Most workers in the manufacturing sector were women, and their market activity was concentrated in textile manufacturing. Once women are included in the analyses, the industrial share of employment follows a U-shaped trajectory from the eighteenth century to the twentieth century. The article concludes that the standard interpretation of structural change, based solely on empirical evidence for male workers, gives a misleading picture of when, where, why, and how structural change occurred.;2019;Women's work and structural change: occupational structure in eighteenth-century Spain;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Sardone, Sergio;This article describes the policy of forced loans, employed in Spain by Charles V to solve the principal financial crises of the Royal Treasury and to fund the main military campaigns of the Habsburg Empire. Specifically, this study is focused on the first requisition of private American treasures?the earliest case of this in European history?which were expropriated in 1523 by the Casa de la Contratación (House of Trade) of Seville to finance the campaign of Fuenterrabía against the French army. The analysis of exceptional archival sources provides details of all the forced loans imposed on the holders of remittances (primarily gold) and the conditions for extinguishing the debts without causing harmful consequences to Atlantic traders. The article challenges the widespread view of the confiscations as an attack on property rights and overly simplistic ideas about the supposedly ?highly absolutistic? or predatory policies attributed to the Crown of Castile in some of the economic historiography.;2019;Forced loans in the Spanish Empire: the first requisition of American treasures in 1523;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Scott, Peter M.; WALKER, JAMES T.";From the mid-1950s to the early 1980s the Treasury and the Bank of England successfully advocated a policy of restricting both private and public sector house-building, as a key but covert instrument of their wider ?stop-go? macroeconomic policy framework. While the intensity of restrictions varied over the economic cycle, private house-building was restricted (through limiting mortgage availability) for almost all this period. This was achieved by keeping building society interest rates low relative to other interest rates and thus starving the building society movement of mortgage funds. Mortgage restriction was never publicly discussed and sometimes operated alongside ambitious housing targets and well-publicized policy initiatives to boost housing demand. This article outlines the evolution of house-building restriction, together with its impacts on the housing sector and the wider economy. We review the evolution of the policy framework and its consequences, compare the level and stability of British house-building during this period?historically and relative to other countries?and undertake time-series econometric analysis of its impacts on both house-building and house prices. Finally, implications for debates regarding stop-go policy, Britain's housing problem, and the distributional consequences of government macroeconomic policy are discussed.;2019;‘Stop-go’ policy and the restriction of postwar British house-building;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Seghezza, Elena; Morelli, Pierluigi";The most widely accepted interpretation of the Second Reform Act is the redistributivist hypothesis. This interpretation, however, is at odds with the absence of redistributive measures in the years after the 1867 Reform Act. Drawing on the social identity hypothesis, we argue that the British elite was convinced that skilled workers were not demanding the right to vote in order to obtain redistributive measures, and therefore they had no misgivings about granting this right to this group of workers. To confirm this, we use an event study to show that the various parliamentary stages of the Second Reform Act had no effect on Consol yield.;2019;Suffrage extension, social identity, and redistribution: the case of the Second Reform Act;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Simson, Rebecca;What can be learned about policy prioritization in Africa by examining long-run trends in public expenditure and employment? Many have contended that Africa's post-colonial leaders pursued economically unproductive budget policies that prioritized the growth of their patronage networks over socially beneficial spending, resulting in bloated payrolls, persistent deficits, and a large rent-seeking public service. Using a purpose-built dataset of annual public expenditure and employment series from Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda for 1960?2010 against which to test these assumptions, this article questions whether there was anything exceptional about the growth or composition of East Africa's post-independence expenditure. All three states grew and contracted in roughly the same periods as other regions of the world, although their contraction after 1980 was particularly marked. Industrial policy and capital investments influenced budget priorities in the early independence era, while military expenditure and debt service payments escalated in the late 1970s. The government wage bill, meanwhile, fell as a proportion of total spending over the same period. To finance employment growth while the wage bill contracted, governments allowed real wages to plummet in the 1970s?90s. In light of these external constraints and legacies, this article questions whether a budget unencumbered by patronage would have looked very different.;2019;Africa's clientelist budget policies revisited: public expenditure and employment in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, 1960–2010;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Skogstad, Karl; Petrunia, Robert J.";This paper uses a financial and operational data set of Canadian gold mines between 1939 and 1945 to analyse the efficacy of two government labour market policies implemented in World War II. An early war policy designated the gold mining industry as vital for the war effort to boost gold output in order to purchase foreign reserves. The late war policy resulted in restrictions that prevented labour movement into and between the mines. We find that the first policy is largely ineffective in its goal. Although the market allocated labour to the lowest cost producers, the policy caused only a modest increase in gold output. To evaluate the second policy, we estimate the cost curves of the individual mines. The results indicate an inefficient allocation of labour across mines. The gold mining industry experiences operating costs 22% higher than with efficient labour allocation during this late war period. The estimated efficiency loss to the industry is nearly $58.4 million 1940 Canadian dollars.;2019;The impact of labour policies on Canadian gold mines in World War II;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Strum, Daniel;The expanding sugar trade linking Portugal, Brazil, and the Netherlands in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries required enforcement mechanisms to guarantee that overseas agents would act honestly and diligently. While the recent literature emphasizes that multiple mechanisms were substitutes in addressing this problem, this article highlights that merchants chose different mechanisms to govern distinct types of transactions and explains why. A reputational mechanism relying on social and economic constraints within an ethnic diaspora governed more complex and higher-value arrangements. A different mechanism linking economic incentives to professional reputations across the diasporas plying this trade route predominated in simpler and smaller transactions. Finally, long-distance and transnational judicial enforcement supplemented these two reputational mechanisms. Capable of matching the value and complexity of transactions with the attributes of governing mechanisms, merchants were able to diversify their transactions, expand the market for agents, better allocate agents to tasks, and stimulate competition among them. The resulting decrease in agency costs was critical in such a significantly competitive market as the sugar trade. Evolving institutional choice thus reinforced the expansion of trade. These hypotheses are corroborated by data from a prosopography of merchants of Jewish origin, derived from notarial records from Oporto and Amsterdam, and from Inquisition files.;2019;Institutional choice in the governance of the early Atlantic sugar trade: diasporas, markets, and courts;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Taylor, Alexander G.;This article addresses one under-studied aspect of Charles I's finances during his Personal Rule: the licensing of tobacco retailers. While it was ultimately a failed project, the tobacco retail licence project was fiscally successful before the transformative events of the 1640s triggered its demise. The project enabled tobacco retail licensees to establish commercial outlets for the marketing of tobacco throughout England and Wales, and cooperation with pre-existing officeholders contributed to the apprehension of unlicensed retailers. Ultimately, the geographic breadth of tobacco licences translated into much-needed royal revenue which, when added to other projects and patents, contributed to the king's financial survival. The evidence presented here suggests that we may want to rethink some of our assumptions for how the process of state formation worked and that earlier seventeenth-century ?prototypes? of taxation were more fiscally successful than previously recognized.;2019;Tobacco retail licences and state formation in early modern England and Wales;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Taylor, Hillary;Historians of early modern England are aware that the legal testimony of poor, dependent, and subordinated individuals was regarded with suspicion. Contemporaries believed that labouring people would provide false evidence in return for ?gifts? or ?rewards?. To what extent did such assumptions accurately reflect the processes whereby such witnesses came to depose for their ?betters?? This article uses sixteenth- and early seventeenth-century perjury and subornation suits from the court of Star Chamber to reconstruct labouring people's experiences and understandings of the politics of testimony. In explicating the structural and material factors that could militate against their deposing, override their reservations about doing so, and colour the contents of the depositions they gave, it makes two broader contributions to our understanding of the period. On the one hand, it presents a markedly more pessimistic account of the social relations involved in the increase in litigation. On the other, it reappraises a category of source?depositions?that historians have long regarded as providing singularly privileged access to the expressions of social groups that left little trace in the historical record.;2019;The price of the poor's words: social relations and the economics of deposing for one's ‘betters’ in early modern England;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Uribe-Castro, Mateo;The redefinition of Catholic Church property rights was common in Europe and the Americas during late eighteenth- and nineteenth-centuries. Given the Church’s power and the level of political violence after independence, these reforms were influential in Latin America. This paper focuses on Colombia after 1850 and measures the impact of the expropriation of Church’s assets on political violence. With yearly data on the number of battles per municipality, archival information on the reform, and difference-in-differences, the paper documents a reduction of political violence in places where the Church’s assets were expropriated. The paper contests the traditional idea of the expropriation of Church’s real estate as a source of political violence. It highlights changes in political competition after the alliance between Conservative factions and the Church was weakened. Specifically, it shows the reduction in political violence was concentrated in municipalities with high political competition and where the Conservative Party was relatively weak.;2019;Expropriation of church wealth and political conflict in 19th century Colombia;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Vilar-Rodríguez, Margarita; Pons-Pons, Jerònia";Throughout history, healthcare, along with diet, has been an essential component of life and a country's welfare. In particular, a country's hospital system is a key indicator for analysing the level of welfare achieved by health coverage. From an economic history perspective, the study of hospital systems is relevant since they stem from public and private investment and produce positive externalities by creating employment and stimulating other economic sectors such as construction and health. Spain provides a significant case study for determining the factors of backwardness in the construction of a modern hospital system in a country on the European periphery. Moreover, it also helps us understand how, despite initial obstacles, this system had attained a significant degree of quality by the end of the twentieth century, as confirmed by its current international hospital rankings and even by the phenomenon of health tourism. The study analyses the creation of the Spanish hospital system during Franco's dictatorship and the transition to democracy. It reveals how the maintenance of a regressive tax system, the use of health policy as political propaganda, and disputes within the political elite of the dictatorship led to an inadequate and fragmented public hospital system, which had to collaborate with the private hospital system, was full of financial holes and tainted by corruption, and remained at the service of privileged groups.;2019;Competition and collaboration between public and private sectors: the historical construction of the Spanish hospital system, 1942–86;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Weller, Leonardo;This article assesses why the French and US banks Paribas and Speyers underwrote a series of loans to revolutionary Mexico in 1912 and 1913, when the state was in the process of collapsing. This is a case of a war debt that failed to prevent the borrowing government from suspending payments and subsequently falling. Based on unpublished primary documents, the article shows that the 1913 loan involved a conflict of interest. The credit delayed a default and sustained the price of Mexican securities while Paribas, its main underwriter, was liquidating its Mexican portfolio. Evidence also suggests the existence of asymmetry of information. Paribas accessed pessimistic but accurate first-hand information on Mexico, while the public read over-optimistic press reports. Paribas forced the government to sell the bonds on the primary market at a price that was low, controlling for publicly available data. It subsequently sold the bonds at a margin on the secondary market. An additional reason for the lending is the Nacional railway, a state-owned company that used a share of the funds to pay its debt. More exposed to Mexico than Paribas, the small and internationalized Speyers held the bad bonds it had underwritten.;2019;Loans of the revolution: how Mexico borrowed as the state collapsed in 1912–13;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Aaronson, Daniel; Davis, Jonathan; Schulze, Karl";Between 1907 and 1914, the “Galveston Movement,” a philanthropic effort spearheaded by Jacob Schiff, fostered the immigration of approximately 10,000 Russian Jews through the Port of Galveston, Texas. Upon arrival, households were given train tickets to pre-selected locations west of the Mississippi River where a job awaited. Despite the program’s stated purpose to locate new Russian Jewish immigrants to the Western part of the U.S., we find that roughly 85 to 90 percent of the prime-age male participants ultimately moved east of the Mississippi, typically to large Northeastern and Midwestern cities.

Absell, Christopher David;During the period spanning independence in 1822 to mid-century, Brazil's south-east shifted from specializing in the export of cane sugar to coffee. This article explores the mechanism underlying this shift by exploiting a wealth of new monthly data on the Brazilian and international coffee and cane sugar markets during the period 1827?40. It argues that the timing of the coffee boom was driven by a rapid increase in foreign market potential associated with the abolition of the tariff on coffee in the US. It estimates that American tariff reform served to increase coffee exports and African slave imports by around one-fifth. American firms, with indirect links to the slave trade, rapidly became major players in the export market in Rio de Janeiro, while non-American firms, traditionally specialized in continental European destinations, turned their sights on the American market.;2020;The rise of coffee in the Brazilian south-east: tariffs and foreign market potential, 1827–40†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Adamson, Jordan;How does a governing coalition’s size affect the extent and type of violence in society? The model developed here predicts that larger coalitions are less likely to fight for private goods (e.g., plunder) than for public goods (e.g., defense), yet this substitution need not reduce the overall scale of fighting. That prediction is tested by investigating how Rome’s transition from Republic to Empire affected military patterns. The raw data and three empirical tests suggest that the Republic engaged in more battles overall and that Republican battles had more of a public goods component. This study furthers our empirical knowledge about the ancient world while bringing data to bear on contemporary debates about the causes of peace and war.;2020;Political institutions, resources, and war: Theory and evidence from ancient Rome;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Ager, Philipp; Eriksson, Katherine; Hansen, Casper Worm; Lønstrup, Lars";This paper examines the long-run effects of the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake on the spatial distribution of economic activity in the American West. Using variation in the potential damage intensity of the earthquake, we show that more severely affected cities experienced lower population increases relative to less affected cities until the late 20th century. The earthquake left a long-lasting mark mainly because it interrupted existing migrant networks. Less affected areas became more attractive migrant destinations in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, which permanently changed relative city sizes in the American West.;2020;How the 1906 San Francisco earthquake shaped economic activity in the American West;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Albers, Thilo N. H.;The currency devaluations of the 1930s facilitated a faster recovery from the Great Depression in the countries depreciating, but their unilateral manner provoked retaliatory and discriminatory commercial policies abroad. This article explores the importance of the retaliatory motive in the imposition of trade barriers by gold bloc countries during the 1930s and its effects on trade. Relying on new and existing datasets on the introduction of quotas, tariffs, and bilateral trade costs, the quantification of the discriminatory response suggests that these countries imposed significant beggar-my-neighbour penalties. The penalties reduced trade to a similar degree that modern regional trade agreements foster trade. Furthermore, the analysis of contemporary newspapers reveals that the devaluations of the early 1930s triggered an Anglo-French trade conflict marked by tit-for-tat protectionist policies. With regards to global trade, the unilateral currency depreciations came at a high price in political and economic terms. These costs must have necessarily reduced their benefit to the world as a whole.;2020;Currency devaluations and beggar-my-neighbour penalties: evidence from the 1930s;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Albers, Thilo N. H.;The wide scope of the study of economic history encompasses the long-run evolution of living standards, sudden crises, their politics, and their consequences. This thesis is about the mother of all modern economic crises. Like no other event, the Great Depression should change economic policy in the twentieth—and as we painfully learned 10 years ago—the twenty first-century. Rightfully, much ink has been spilled on the monetary origins of the Depression, be they of systematic (Eichengreen) or executive (Friedman) nature. Together with novel research agendas of how crises propagate through financial channels, we now have a much fuller picture of the Great Depression. Yet, in one key area of economics, we have arguably made little progress in our understanding of global crises since the 1930s. We have not yet confronted the question of how important real trade linkages are in a Great Depression-type event in a way that allows us to sensibly discuss how devastating misguided trade policies can be. The first part of this thesis aims to fill this blind spot, providing important lessons for economic history and economics. The second part of this thesis focuses on political and geographical trade frictions and the politics underlying them. Combining these two parts yields policy recommendations for economic crises in the twenty first-century.;2020;Trade frictions, trade policies, and the interwar business cycle‡;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Aldunate, Felipe; González, Felipe; Prem, Mounu; Urzúa, Francisco";Business groups are the predominant organizational structure in modern Chile. This article tests the long-standing hypothesis that the privatization reform implemented by the “Chicago Boys” during the Pinochet regime facilitated the creation of new groups and hence the renovation of the country’s elites. Using new data we find that firms sold during this privatization later became part of new business groups, process aided by an economic crisis that debilitated traditional elites. Moreover, some firms were bought by Pinochet’s allies and were later used as providers of capital within groups. We conclude that privatizations can empower outsiders to replace business elites.;2020;Privatization and business groups: Evidence from the Chicago Boys in Chile;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Allen, Douglas W.; Leonard, Bryan";At noon on April 22, 1889, a gunshot on the border of what was then called the Unassigned Lands of the Indian Territory launched the first of six well-defined land giveaways in what is now the state of Oklahoma. Contemporary newspaper and eyewitness accounts described the prairie starting line as awash in the largest gathering in the West to that date, with a subsequent massive rush, followed by the disappointment of many who were unable to make a claim. Similar outcomes were reported at the other openings, and these reports have been repeated and accepted in popular culture and the academic literature. Using recently digitized BLM land grant records, data from the U.S. Census of Agriculture, and the 1890 Oklahoma Territorial Census, we re-examine the land openings and show that the historical accounts greatly overstate the number of people actually rushing for lands.;2020;How many rushed during the Oklahoma land openings?;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Anderson, D. Mark; Rees, Daniel I.; Wang, Tianyi";During the first two decades of the 20th century, diarrheal deaths among American infants and children surged every summer. Although we still do not know what pathogen (or pathogens) caused this phenomenon, the consensus view is that it was eventually controlled through public health efforts at the municipal level. Using data from 26 major American cities for the period 1910-1930, we document the phenomenon of summer diarrhea and explore its dissipation. We find that water filtration is associated with a 15 percent reduction in diarrheal mortality among children under the age of two during the non-summer months, but does not seem to have had an effect on diarrheal mortality during the summer. In general, we find little evidence to suggest that public health interventions undertaken at the municipal level contributed to the dissipation of summer diarrhea.;2020;The phenomenon of summer diarrhea and its waning, 1910-1930⁎;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Antipa, Pamfili M.;"What causes prices to evolve? This question lies at the heart of economics, a science concerned with the human decision-making process. Prices contain most relevant information for investment, consumption, or production decisions; they also reflect the equilibrium conditions of markets.
For a central bank, a comforting answer to the above question would be “Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon in the sense that it can be produced only by a more rapid increase in the quantity of money than in output” (Friedman 1970, p. 24). In my PhD, I show, on the contrary, that the central bank is incapable of maintaining price stability when fiscal policies do not guarantee a sustainable public budget. The importance of fiscal policy for the determination of the price level has been emphasized in a number of papers, such as Chamley and Polemarchakis 1984, Del Negro and Sims 2015, Tobin 1961, Sargent and Wallace 1981, and Woodford 2001.

Using data describing the salaries of 34 Major League Baseball players during the 1880s, we test whether average salaries, remuneration to marginal product, and the premium paid to a player for changing teams were materially impacted when the reserve clause became binding in 1887. The empirical results suggest that, controlling for player attributes and the overall macroeconomy, average real salaries in the sample fell by 6–9% after the binding reserve clause. We also find that the premium for moving to a new team was reduced by 70% after the binding reserve clause was implemented, supporting Rottenberg’s invariance principle.;2020;The introduction of the reserve clause in Major League Baseball: evidence of its impact on select player salaries during the 1880s;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Ayuda, María Isabel; Ferrer-Pérez, Hugo; Pinilla, Vicente";The objective of this article is to provide an in-depth study of France's performance in the new international wine market that began to take shape from the middle of the nineteenth century. We analyse the main determinants of its success in exporting ordinary and high-quality wine using a gravity model for both types of wine. The article shows how France lost foreign markets in the ordinary wine sector, due to difficulties in maintaining its exports, which resulted from the decrease in production caused by the phylloxera plague and increasing competition from growing numbers of producers who were more efficient at producing these types of wines. However, in the high-quality wine market, French exporters enjoyed considerable success, increasing their exports thanks to their efforts to offer a product that was highly valued abroad and the use of modern marketing and sales techniques. The exports benefited from the fall in transport costs and French colonial expansion. However, exports of both products were severely affected by a series of major events, including the First World War, the Russian Revolution, Prohibition in the US, and the Great Depression. This case study of the wine market shows that the collapse of the first globalization was not the same for all products.;2020;A leader in an emerging new international market: the determinants of French wine exports, 1848–1938;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Ayuso-Díaz, Alejandro; Tena-Junguito, Antonio";During the interwar years, Japanese industrialization accelerated alongside the expansion of industrial exports to regional markets. Trade blocs in the interwar years were used as an instrument of imperial power to foster exports and as a substitute for productivity to encourage industrial production. The historiography on Japanese industrialization in the interwar years describes heavy industries? interests in obtaining access to wider markets to increase economies of scale and reduce unit costs. However, this literature provides no quantitative evidence that proves the success of those mechanisms in expanding exports. In this article we scrutinize how Japan?a relatively poor country?used colonial as well as informal power interventions to expand regional markets for its exports, especially for the most intensive human capital sector of the industrializing economy. Our results show that Japanese exports in 1938 would have been around one-third smaller had no empire ever existed, which indicates an outstanding effect of empire in the international context.;2020;Trade in the shadow of power: Japanese industrial exports in the interwar years;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"BASSINO, JEAN-PASCAL; van der Eng, Pierre";This article uses expenditure-based purchasing power parities (PPPs) to estimate GDP per capita in comparable prices for 12 Asian countries for six benchmark years during the period 1913?69. The article finds that in 1913 levels of real GDP per capita in several countries were comparable to those in Japan. GDP per capita in Japan and other Asian countries diverged during and after the First World War. The article questions whether Asia's ?little divergence? between Japan and other Asian countries dates back to the late eighteenth century. It draws attention to the different resource endowments of Japan, China, and India compared to other Asian countries, and their implications for the development trajectories of Asian countries. The article demonstrates that using historical PPP estimates yields estimates of GDP per capita that diverge from those based on retropolations of the single 1990 PPP-converted benchmark year. It concludes that historical estimates of PPPs are needed to confirm analyses of comparative economic performance based on available GDP per capita data.;2020;Asia's ‘little divergence’ in the twentieth century: evidence from PPP-based direct estimates of GDP per capita, 1913–69;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Bent, Peter H.;What drives recoveries after financial crises? I address this question for the 1870–1913 “first era of globalization,” focusing on whether trade policy changes or positive movements in commodity prices played a bigger role in stimulating output growth after financial crises in peripheral economies. At this time before governments had modern fiscal and monetary policy tools to use while responding to crises protectionism was one of the few national-level policy options available for shaping economic activity. Improving terms of trade is another major factor that could influence output growth in the commodity-exporting countries included in this analysis. While previous studies of this period have looked at longer-run associations between these explanatory variables and economic growth, I focus on the aftermath of crises, and find that tariff rate increases had a positive impact on GDP per capita growth, while positive terms of trade changes did not have a significant effect on output growth. This suggests that governments played a substantial role in shaping post-crisis recoveries during this period.;2020;Recovery from financial crises in peripheral economies, 1870–1913;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Blanc, Guillaume; Wacziarg, Romain";Using a unique, comprehensive household-level dataset for a single French village, we study the process of modernization during a period of rapid institutional and demographic transformation. We document changes in fertility, mortality, literacy and intergenerational social mobility. The fall in fertility followed the French Revolution and the Age of Enlightenment, and preceded the rise in education by several decades. Rising literacy followed an increase in the supply of schooling due to the Guizot Law. All these changes occurred in the absence of industrialization in and around the village. We conclude that institutional and cultural changes originating outside the village were likely the dominant forces accounting for its modernization.;2020;Change and persistence in the Age of Modernization: Saint-Germain-d’Anxure, 1730–1895;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Bossie, Andrew;It is generally assumed that the buildup of liquid assets in the USA during WWII played a large role in generating postwar economic activity. Contrary to this assumption, I establish that military contract spending during the war slowed down the growth of bank balance sheets at the state level during the period 1940–1955. State-level bank balance sheets are 10.8 cents smaller per $1 of total military spending by 1949 and 5.8 cents smaller by 1955. This is primarily driven by slower growth of demand deposits. The adjustment on the asset side is largely through reserves and Treasury holdings. Local lending also grows more slowly after the war, but this decrease is relatively small and temporary. This suggests that the local real economy was largely insulated from the slower growth in deposits by the wartime buildup of paper assets. Historical evidence points to the fact that slower growth of deposits is likely driven by a relative decline in demand for deposits by large corporations in war industries.;2020;Monetary and fiscal interactions in the USA during the 1940s;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Boter, Corinne;"Conventional methods of measuring historical household living standards are often criticized because of the omission of women's and children's wages and non-wage income; the focus on urban centres; and the exclusion of life-cycle changes in household composition, income, and consumption. This article presents a method that accounts for these issues and applies it to agricultural and textile households in the early-twentieth century Netherlands. It uses total household income, as opposed to the husband's wage, as the enumerator for calculating alternative welfare ratios. The results show that welfare ratios were not only structurally higher than those based on the male-breadwinner model, but also followed a different life-cycle trajectory. Furthermore, household portfolios were diversified and depended on local labour market structures. Thus, the study concludes that analyses based on men's wages only reflect the rough outlines of how households functioned.";2020;Living standards and the life cycle: reconstructing household income and consumption in the early twentieth-century Netherlands†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Boter, Corinne; WOLTJER, PIETER";During the nineteenth century, Dutch female labor force participation (FLFP) was relatively low. Most scholars argue that social norms and rising wages were driving this development. However, their conclusions principally apply to married women. We study unmarried women’s LFP (UFLFP) and investigate a third driver: shifting sectoral employment shares. We include all three drivers in a logistic regression based on nearly 2 million marriage records from 1812 to 1929. We conclude that social norms and income levels mattered, but that shifting sectoral employment shares were driving the decline in UFLFP because sectors with low demand for female laborers expanded.;2020;The impact of sectoral shifts on Dutch unmarried women’s labor force participation, 1812–1929;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

We study empirically how the settlement location of migrants affected their economic, social and political integration in West Germany. We first document large differences in integration outcomes across West German counties. We then show that high inflows of migrants and a large agrarian base hampered integration. Religious differences between migrants and natives had no effect on economic integration. Yet, they decreased intermarriage rates and strengthened anti-migrant parties. Based on our estimates, we simulate the regional distribution of migrants that maximizes their labor force participation.

"BURINGH, ELTJO; Campbell, Bruce M. S.; Rijpma, Auke; van Zanden, Jan Luiten";In a Christian age, churches reflected societies’ material resources as well as their religious and cultural aspirations. Data on the construction history of 1,695 major churches in present-day Italy, France, Switzerland, Germany, the Low Countries, and Great Britain are used to infer the trend and pattern of economic activity between 700 and 1500 CE. Across this long and economically formative, but relatively poorly documented era, they are among the few artefacts that can be quantified consistently. This is the first attempt to resolve the methodological challenges entailed in systematically gathering, organising and analysing this information at a supra-national scale. The results imply a transformation in Western Europe from the end of the 10th century with steeply gathering momentum, culminating in the great boom of the 12th century. Fresh light is also shed on the long contraction that set in from the late-13th century. Rising agricultural production and feudal surplus extraction were important drivers early on, but over time construction activity was most vigorous at locations enjoying commercial and especially maritime advantages. By the 15th century, as the impetus of construction was faltering almost everywhere, it was in commercially resilient Brabant and the Netherlands that church building remained most buoyant.;2020;Church building and the economy during Europe’s ‘Age of the Cathedrals’, 700–1500 CE;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Cappelli, Gabriele; Vasta, Michelangelo";This article shows that a shift towards a more centralized school system can benefit countries that are characterized by poor levels of human capital and large regional disparities in education. In 1911, Italy moved from a fully decentralized primary school system towards centralization through the Daneo-Credaro Reform. The design of the Reform allows us to compare treated municipalities with those that retained school autonomy. Our quasi-experiment, based on propensity score matching (PSM), shows that centralization substantially increased the pace of human capital accumulation. Treated municipalities were characterized by a 0.43 percentage-point premium on the average annual growth of literacy between 1911 and 1921. We discuss some of the channels through which the new legislation affected primary schooling and literacy, with important implications for long-term economic growth.;2020;Can school centralization foster human capital accumulation?

"CHAMBERS, DAVID; Saleuddin, Rasheed";It is often thought that the arrival of the Black?Scholes?Merton (BSM) model of option pricing in the early 1970s allowed traders to understand how to price and value options with greater precision. However, our study suggests that interwar commodity options traders may have been able to intuit ?fair? value and to adjust their prices to changes in the market environment well before the advent of this innovative model. A scarcity of historical price data has limited empirical tests of option price efficiency well before BSM to studies of stock options in the 1870s and the early twentieth century which revealed contrasting findings. This study deals with option pricing in a different market?commodities?during the interwar period. We conclude that option prices were closer to their BSM theoretical values than prior studies suggest. Institutional differences between interwar commodity options markets and stock options markets in the 1870s and the early twentieth century may partly account for this result. Furthermore, we find that interwar option prices were no more mispriced than in modern times, and were as sensitive to changes in volatility?the key valuation parameter in the BSM model.;2020;Commodity option pricing efficiency before Black, Scholes, and Merton;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Chambru, Cédric;Did weather shocks increase interpersonal conflict in early modern Europe? I address this question by exploiting year-to-year seasonal variations in temperature and detailed crime data assembled from Savoyard criminal procedures over the period 1749–92. I find that temperature shocks had a positive and significant effect on the level of property crimes, but a negative and significant effect on violent crimes. I further document how seasonal migration helped to increase the coping capacity of local communities. Indeed, migrant labour both brought in remittances that supplemented communities’ resources, as well as temporarily relieved impoverished households of the burden of feeding these workers. I show that while temperature shocks were strongly associated with an increase in property crime rates, the effect was much lower in provinces with high levels of seasonal migration. I provide historical evidence demonstrating that the inflow of remittances may have driven this relationship.;2020;Weather shocks, poverty and crime in 18th-century Savoy;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Cioni, Martina; Federico, Giovanni; Vasta, Michelangelo";The growing appeal of the long-run perspective among economists and the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of the Conrad and Meyer article (1958), which marked the official beginning of the Cliometric Revolution, have attracted a lot of interest on economic history. This paper explores the long-term development of economic history by analysing all the 6516 articles published in the top five international journals (Economic History Review, Journal of Economic History, Explorations in Economic History, European Review of Economic History and Cliometrica). Our main results are that the Cliometric Revolution took quite a long time to fully display its effects. We show that the conventional wisdom on the current state of the discipline seems a bit too optimistic. Economic history does not seem to be neither more comparative nor more focussed on peripheral countries. The historical periods studied do not change considerably, and the relevance of different topics did not change univocally. Most articles use some econometrics but only a minority feature advanced techniques. Economic history is indeed becoming more democratic, but its boundaries remain limited to the most advanced countries. Articles by authors from Continental Europe increased substantially, while that of North American declined. This change may be the harbinger of a new divergence between the two shores of the Atlantic, possibly related to the rise of a new paradigm, but it is too early to tell.;2020;The long-term evolution of economic history: evidence from the top five field journals (1927–2017);Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Clark, Gregory; Leigh, Andrew; Pottenger, Mike";There is longstanding pride among Australians that by throwing off the social class demarcations that defined their ossified colonial parent society, England, they created an open, socially mobile society. The paper tests this belief by estimating long run social mobility rates in Australia 1870–2017, using the status of rare surnames. The status information includes occupations from electoral rolls 1903–1980, and records of degrees awarded by Melbourne and Sydney universities 1852–2017. Status persistence was strong throughout, with an intergenerational correlation of occupational or educational status of 0.7–0.8, and no change over time. Mobility rates were also just as low within UK immigrants and their descendants, so ethnic group effects explain none of the immobility. The less pronounced class divisions of Australia compared to England did not enhance social mobility. A possible sign of enhanced Australian social mobility – the fact that surnames associated with convicts already had a modest elite status by 1870 – seems to derive from convicts transported to Australia from England being positively selected in terms of human capital.;2020;Frontiers of mobility: Was Australia 1870–2017 a more socially mobile society than England?;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Colvin, Christopher L.; Henderson, Stuart; Turner, John D.";"Cooperatively owned Raiffeisen banks first emerged in the Netherlands in the late 1890s and spread rapidly across the country. Using a new dataset, we investigate the determinants of their market entry and early performance. We find the cooperative organisational form, when allied to a change in the structure of Dutch agriculture and the socioreligious pillarisation of Dutch society, was an important factor explaining their entry into rural financial markets. While religious organisations provided a necessary impetus for the emergence of Raiffeisen banks, the economic advantages associated with cooperative enterprises ensured the subsequent survival and success of these banks.

Court, Victor;This article looks at the most recent data to define when the Little and Great Divergence occurred. It sorts the deep determinants of economic development into three categories (biogeography, culture-institutions, and contingency-conjuncture) to provides a comprehensive review of these factors in the context of the Great Divergence, and it discusses the concepts of persistence and reversal of fortune. The paper concludes that the Great Divergence was never an inevitability but became an increasingly likely prospect as time progressed. Furthermore, biogeography, culture-institutions, and contingency-conjuncture are not contradictory hypotheses. Rather, there is a clear pattern of change over time of the relative importance of these three categories of determinants. Further research is needed to uncover the underlying causal link or latent variable that could explain the successive relative importance over time of biogeographical, cultural–institutional, and contingent–conjunctural determinants of the Great Divergence.;2020;A reassessment of the Great Divergence debate: towards a reconciliation of apparently distinct determinants;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Cox, Gary W.;North and Weingast (1989) argued that the Glorious Revolution broadly enhanced the British state’s credibility. In contrast, I argue that the Revolution made the state’s fiscal-military component credible but left its civil component no more credible than it had been before. This differential credibility explains the stark contrast in efficiency and hierarchy that developed between the fiscal-military and civil administrations after the Revolution. When the Civil List Act 1831 capped a half century of reform and put the civil budget wholly under parliament’s control, the developmental gaps between the state’s two components abruptly began to close. I show this by documenting structural breaks in the growth rate and organization of the civil state.;2020;British state development after the Glorious Revolution;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

I documented a structural break in per capita patenting in 1734—but only in London, where specifications were stored.

Davenport, Romola J.;In the long-running debate over standards of living during the industrial revolution, pessimists have identified deteriorating health conditions in towns as undermining the positive effects of rising real incomes on the ?biological standard of living?. This article reviews long-run historical relationships between urbanization and epidemiological trends in England, and then addresses the specific question: did mortality rise especially in rapidly growing industrial and manufacturing towns in the period c. 1830?50? Using comparative data for British, European, and American cities and selected rural populations, this study finds good evidence for widespread increases in mortality in the second quarter of the nineteenth century. However, this phenomenon was not confined to ?new? or industrial towns. Instead, mortality rose in the 1830s especially among young children (aged one to four years) in a wide range of populations and environments. This pattern of heightened mortality extended between c. 1830 and c. 1870, and coincided with a well-established rise and decline in scarlet fever virulence and mortality. The evidence presented here therefore supports claims that mortality worsened for young children in the middle decades of the nineteenth century, but also indicates that this phenomenon was more geographically ubiquitous, less severe, and less chronologically concentrated than previously argued.;2020;Urbanization and mortality in Britain, c. 1800–50;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Devijlder, Nicolas; Schoors, Koen";In this paper, we investigate the hypothesis that the economic divergence across Flemish localities between 1830 and 1910 is explained by the theory of Hernando de Soto. We hypothesize that the uniform land rights installed after the French revolution provided borrowers with an attractive form of collateral. Conditional on the presence of local financial development provided by a new government-owned bank this eased access to external finance and fostered industrial and commercial economic activity. Using primary historical data of about 1179 localities in Flanders, we find that the variation in the local value of land (collateral) and the variation in local financial development jointly explain a substantial amount of the variation in non-agricultural employment accumulated between 1830 and 1910. By 1910, industrial and commercial economic activity was more developed in localities where both early (1846) rural land prices were high and early (1880) local financial development was more pronounced, which is in line with the ‘de Soto’ hypothesis.;2020;Land rights, local financial development and industrial activity: evidence from Flanders (nineteenth–early twentieth century);Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Domini, Giacomo;This paper investigates the relevance for innovation of international exhibitions. While the first of these events, i.e., London’s 1851 Great Exhibition, was an “exhibition of innovations,” many of the subsequent ones, following the model of industrial exhibitions developed in France, did not select exhibits based on novelty. In fact, they displayed a large spectrum of products, ranging from machines to primary products. Therefore, the suitability of data from their catalogs for proxying innovation, and their relationship to the traditional patent measure, should be better qualified. To do so, this paper performs an in-depth analysis of the Turin 1911 international exhibition, a medium-sized representative “French-model” exhibition. It matches a new database, built from the catalog of this event, with patents granted in Italy, revealing substantial differences. Furthermore, it evaluates how inventors could use the exhibition to promote their ideas, establish their reputation, and develop their career.;2020;Exhibitions, patents, and innovation in the early twentieth century: evidence from the Turin 1911 International Exhibition;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Dye, Alan; La Croix, Sumner J.";We examine the formation of property rights in land during the early settlement by the Dutch of the Cape Colony at the southern tip of Africa. After its founding in 1652 as a provisioning outpost for ships of the Dutch East India Company (VOC), the colonial government promoted settlement initially by granting land with well-specified and enforced property rights in restricted zones near Cape Town. By 1714 it transitioned to accommodate rapidly expanding settlement by creating a weaker form of property rights, the loan farm, which was imprecisely defined and had limited government enforcement. We develop a profit-maximizing monopsony model to explain the VOC's choice to transition from the better-specified land grant to the less well-specified loan farm. We conclude that the decline in the population size and ability of the Khoikhoi, the Cape's original inhabitants, to organize effective resistance to the Dutch invasion was critical to the transition, as it lowered the costs of private enforcement of settlers? territorial claims. The choice of property rights thus enabled and encouraged the rapid taking by European settlers of the western Cape of Africa for the expansion of the Dutch colony's pastoral economy.;2020;Institutions for the taking: property rights and the settlement of the Cape Colony, 1652–1750;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Enflo, Kerstin; Missiaia, Anna";The causes and extent of regional inequality in the process of economic growth are at the core of historical economic research. So far, much attention has been devoted to studying the role of industrialization in driving regional divergence. However, empirical studies on relatively unequal countries such as Italy and Spain show that inequality was already high at the outset of modern industrialization. Using new estimates of Swedish regional GDP, this article looks for the first time at regional inequality in a pre-industrial European economy. Its findings show that inequality increased dramatically between 1571 and 1750 and stayed high until the mid-nineteenth century. This result refutes the classical view that the industrial take-off was the main driver of regional divergence. Decomposing the Theil index for GDP per worker, we find that the bulk of inequality from 1750 onwards was driven by structural differences across sectors rather than different regional productivity within sectors. We show that counties with higher agricultural productivity followed a classic Malthusian pattern when experiencing technological advancement, while those with higher industrial productivity did not. We suggest that institutional factors, such as the creation of the Swedish Empire, Stockholm's trading rights, and a protective industrial policy, amplified this exceptional pattern.;2020;Between Malthus and the industrial take-off: regional inequality in Sweden, 1571–1850;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Eriksson, Katherine;This paper examines the effect of ethnic enclaves on economic outcomes of Norwegian immigrants in 1910 and 1920, the later part of the Age of Mass Migration. Using various identification strategies, including county fixed effects and an instrumental variables strategy based on chain migration, I consistently find that Norwegians living in larger enclaves in the United States had lower occupational earnings, were more likely to be in farming occupations, and were less likely to be in white-collar occupations. Results are robust to matching method and choice of occupational score. This earnings disadvantage is partly passed on to the second generation.;2020;Ethnic enclaves and immigrant outcomes: Norwegian immigrants during the Age of Mass Migration;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Feng, Chen; Shi, Beibei; Xu, Ming";It is important to understand the political determinants of long-term economic prosperity. In Sichuan Province of China, there historically existed two long-standing political institutions: a centralized system, represented by the prefecture system, and a decentralized system, represented by the Tusi system. This study utilizes a unique historical dataset for 181 counties in Sichuan Province and implements a regression discontinuity design to estimate the impact of different institutions on long-term economic development. The results indicate that the Tusi system significantly suppressed the performance of the local economy and impeded current regional openness and urbanization. By tracing the channels of its persistent effect, we document that the influence of these historical institutions has persisted mainly through the shaping of human capital and state capacity. The Tusi system is not only harmful to cultural communication and local educational progress but also inhibits the government’s capacity and the formation of authoritarianism.;2020;The political origin of differences in long-term economic prosperity: centralization versus decentralization;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Gallardo-Albarrán, Daniel;Clean water provision is considered crucial for eradicating waterborne diseases. However, the benefits of piped water can be limited in environments characterized by the inadequate storage and disposal of waste. This article studies the impact of waterworks and sewerage on mortality in German cities during the period 1877?1913. The results show that the supply of safe drinking water reduced the number of deaths, although to a lower extent than suggested previously. In the absence of efficient systems of sewage removal, contact with faeces and water contamination created a favourable environment for the spread of enteric ailments, offsetting some of the positive effects of waterworks. Moreover, the study shows that sanitary investments had important heterogeneous effects. First, their impact was markedly lower in municipalities with high levels of economic inequality and employment in the textile sector. Second, cities located in non-Prussian territories experienced lower declines in mortality following the construction of sanitary infrastructures. The results in this article highlight the importance of analysing public health measures jointly as well as their interaction with local socioeconomic and institutional factors to understand historical progress against ill health and premature death.;2020;Sanitary infrastructures and the decline of mortality in Germany, 1877–1913†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Galli, Stefania; Rönnbäck, Klas";We analyze the level of inequality in rural Sierra Leone in the early colonial period. Previous research has suggested that the colony was established under highly egalitarian ideals. We examine whether these ideals also are reflected in the real distribution of wealth in the colony. We employ a newly assembled dataset extracted from census data in the colony in 1831. The results show that rural Sierra Leone exhibited one of the most equal distributions of wealth so far estimated for any preindustrial rural society.;2020;Colonialism and rural inequality in Sierra Leone: an egalitarian experiment;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Galofré Vilà, Gregori;This paper shows that conditional cash transfers under Aid to Dependent Children (ADC), a main program of the 1935 Social Security Act, reduced infant, children and adult mortality. I take advantage of the transition from mothers’ pensions to ADC and the large differences in ADC payments and eligibility across 104 cities, 2,260 counties, and 49 states to estimate the impacts of cash transfers on mortality rates, by age, sex, race, and cause between 1929 and 1944. I find that ADC's expansion reduced infant and adult mortality by between 10 and 20 percent. This finding, based on an event-study design, is robust to a range of specifications, difference-and-differences, an instrumental variable strategy, a range of fixed effects, placebo tests and a border-pair policy discontinuity design. The largest mortality reductions came from drops in communicable and infectious diseases, such as influenza, pneumonia and tuberculosis.;2020;Quantifying the impact of aid to dependent children: An epidemiological framework⁎;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
García Morcillo, Marta;Cicero's letters to his friend Atticus are an invaluable source for the study of the financial and economic activities pursued by Late Republican upper-class Romans. Beyond the information concerning the diversity, scale, and impact of their businesses, these extraordinary documents give enlightening testimonies to the psychological factors that affected economic behaviour and the process of decision-making. The case of Tullia's shrine, a complex operation that concerned the search for and purchase of a garden-estate in one of the most exclusive areas of the Roman suburbs, became Cicero's most personal challenge and obsession. An accurate study of this affair through the orator's own voice allows us to explore the concept of ancient rationality, as well as the psychological and environmental mechanisms that led to economic strategies and performances. The study also tests the applicability of ideas and methodologies from the field of behavioural economics in the context of the first-century BC real estate market, a fluctuating and speculative business sector highly informed by credit culture, social status, and unstable politics.;2020;Mentality, motivation, and economic decision-making in Ancient Rome: Cicero and Tullia's shrine;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Gelderblom, Oscar; Jong, Abe de; Jonker, Joost";We examine an unusual contract which the Dutch East India Company (VOC) sold to investors in 1613. The firm was in a position as modelled by Froot, Scharfstein and Stein for modern corporations: facing heavy, strategic investment, about to reap the benefits, but unable to attract the necessary capital. Hedging or insurance then makes sense to safeguard continued operations. Understanding this, the VOC directors took out insurance on incoming cash from return cargoes. We analyze the contract’s price and underwriters and contrast the VOC’s single use of this peculiar instrument with the English East India Company’s later repeated application.;2020;Learning how to manage risk by hedging: the VOC insurance contract of 1613;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Geloso, Vincent; Lindert, Peter";The kinds of goods that richer and poorer households consumed differed more strongly in the past than today. Movements in the relative prices of luxury goods versus staples caused the real inequality to oscillate in ways missed by the usual historiography of (nominal) inequality. On both sides of the North Atlantic and in Australia, real inequality rose substantially less in 1800–1914 than the literature on nominal inequality has revealed. The reasons for this relate to the relative decline of food prices, rural–urban price gaps, and the delayed rise of luxury service prices, especially after 1850. Throughout these centuries, the North Americans enjoyed lower living costs than their counterparts in England.;2020;Relative costs of living, for richer and poorer, 1688–1914;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Measuring an imperial governor’s performance by his ability of peacekeeping, we test whether the central authorities in the Russian Empire resorted to career incentives to improve the performance of provincial governors. We find that the central administration promoted better performing governors only in the peripheral provinces (oblasts), but not in the main ones (gubernias). In addition, we show that political connections had no significant effect on career prospects.;2020;Career incentives in political hierarchy: evidence from Imperial Russia†;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
González, Felipe;I study a settlement policy implemented by the Chilean government between 1882 and 1904 to analyze the relationship between European immigration and the human capital of natives. Using historical censuses, I show that this policy was successful in recruiting skilled Europeans, who located in different parts of the country. Using a panel data of provinces observed between 1860 and 1920, I find a strong, positive, and robust correlation between recruited Europeans and the human capital of natives. This finding is not driven by changes in the provision of public goods or regional shocks. However, the arrival of Europeans is associated with an increase local economic output 50 years after the policy was terminated. These changes in the local economy, together with narrative historical evidence, suggest that a modernization of economic activities is a potential explanation for the increase in the human capital of natives.;2020;Immigration and human capital: consequences of a nineteenth century settlement policy;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
GRAHAM, AARON;Before 1852 the English patent system operated at both a domestic and a global level, allowing inventors to extend its operation beyond England to the colonies, where it interacted in territories such as Jamaica with a colonial system of patents and grants. It therefore provides one of the few examples of a workable global patent system, and an important case study of the structures that supported the development and circulation of technology within the British Atlantic during the early stages of the industrial revolution. Providing a framework of ?tiered? rather than ?parallel? powers and jurisdictions, the imperial patent system was a flexible instrument that inventors could use strategically to promote transnational technological innovation, in which people, ideas, and skills moved back and forth between Britain and colonies such as Jamaica. Patenting, which was concentrated in wealthy plantation colonies that sought greater productivity, was therefore a key part of the economic development of empire.;2020;Patents and invention in Jamaica and the British Atlantic before 1857 †;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Gregg, Amanda G.;When do firms produce their inputs instead of purchasing them on markets? Firms may vertically integrate when markets are thinner to mitigate price risk. However, firms that wish to vertically or horizontally integrate may be unable to do if integration requires additional capital and they face financial constraints. Using detailed factory-level and firm-level manufacturing census data, this paper supports a thin markets explanation of integration within the Russian cotton textile industry in 1894 and 1900, though integration into capital-intensive industries like spinning required financial resources. Unlike contexts in which specialized firms dominated, vertically integrated Russian cotton firms were more productive.;2020;Vertical and horizontal integration in Imperial Russian cotton textiles, 1894–1900;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Guinnane, Timothy W.; Schneebacher, Jakob";A considerable theoretical and empirical literature studies the corporation’s enterprise choices, most prominently capital structure. Economists have paid less attention to other enterprise forms such as partnerships, which typically operate under different legal constraints and appeal to smaller enterprises. Yet partnerships were the dominant business organization for the period in which wealthy countries first experienced long-run economic growth, and they remain quantitatively significant in some important economies today. After reviewing the growing empirical literature on this subject, we use a series of simple models to study several aspects of the partnership’s choice of capital structure and how this relates to a firm’s choice of enterprise form. Common features of partnerships reflect the difficulty of raising capital for ventures whose prospects are hard to judge. These results highlight the need for several specific avenues for future research.;2020;Enterprise form: Theory and history;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Hao, Yu; Liu, Kevin Zhengcheng";This article explores a tax reform in eighteenth-century China that formalized county-level informal surtaxes and centralized control over them in the hands of provincial governors, in an effort to strengthen provincial fiscal capacity. The findings show that this reform increased the frequency of famine relief in cases of exceptional disaster relative to other weather conditions. The study shows that the effects were driven by the new fiscal revenues?public funds?at the governors? discretion, not by the central government's relief actions, bureaucratic control over lower officials, or other concurrent fiscal reforms. Moreover, the reform facilitated intertemporal smoothing and inter-regional risk sharing. However, the effects declined as soon as the central government broke its promise and began to appropriate provincial fiscal revenues. These findings not only provide evidence that fiscal centralization could enhance the provision of public goods in a premodern context, but also highlight that it was the lack of a credible commitment by the central government to the provincial governments that accounted for the short-lived effects of the reform.;2020;Taxation, fiscal capacity, and credible commitment in eighteenth-century China: the effects of the formalization and centralization of informal surtaxes†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Humphries, Jane; Schneider, Benjamin";In an earlier article we used archival and printed primary sources to construct the first long-run wage series for hand spinning in early modern Britain. This evidence challenged Robert Allen's claim that spinners were part of the ?high wage economy?, which he sees as motivating invention, innovation, and mechanization in the spinning section of the textile industry. We respond to Allen's subsequent criticism of our argument, sources, and methods, and his presentation of alternative evidence. Allen contends that we have understated both the earnings and associated productivity of hand spinners by focusing on part-time and low-quality workers. His rejoinder rests on an ahistorical account of spinners? work and similarly weak evidence on wages as did his initial claims. Our augmented version of the spinners? wages dataset confirms our original findings. Spinners? wages were low even compared with other women workers, and neither wages nor the piece rates that determined unit labour costs followed a trajectory that could explain the invention and spread of the spinning jenny.;2020;Losing the thread: a response to Robert Allen†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Jaadla, Hannaliis; Potter, Ellen; Keibek, Sebastian; Davenport, Romola J.";"Historical relationships between socio-economic status and mortality remain poorly understood. This is particularly the case in England, due to a lack of status indicators in available sources especially before c. 1850. This study uses the paternal occupational descriptors routinely recorded in Anglican baptism registers from 1813?37 to compare infant and early childhood mortality by social status. The sample consists of eight of the Cambridge Group family reconstitution parishes, which make it possible to investigate the contributions of environment as well as household characteristics. The main variable of interest was an individual-level continuous measure of wealth based on ranking paternal occupations by the propensity for their movable wealth to be inventoried upon death. The findings show that wealth conferred no clear survival advantage in infancy, once differences in average mortality levels between parishes were adjusted for. However, wealth was associated with higher survival rates in early childhood, especially in the second year of life, and this pattern persisted after adjustment for parish-level effects. The striking exception to this pattern was labourers, who were among the poorest of fathers but whose children enjoyed relatively low mortality. Thus socio-economic differentials in mortality were present in early nineteenth-century England; however, they were small, age-specific, and non-linear.";2020;Infant and child mortality by socio-economic status in early nineteenth-century England †;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Jaremski, Matthew;While first highlighted by Romer (J Econ Educ 25:49–66, 1994), economic history has only continued to become more integrated into the broader discipline. This paper utilizes a sample of recent articles in top Economics journals to help assess what characteristics economic history papers share and a sample of recent graduate syllabi to examine the role that a required economic history class can play more broadly in the training of economists. The samples confirm that economic history research utilizing a wide range of topics and tools is being published in top economics journals and taught in economic history classes.

These include matching theory and empirics to the economic environment, accounting for data quality in measurement, and conducting counterfactuals. I then use examples from a growing literature to illustrate how these approaches have been used to make progress on questions in economic history related to market power and competition, the role of institutions, and economic geography and transportation infrastructure. I conclude by briefly highlighting areas for future research.;2020;Specification and structure in economic history;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Jorge-Sotelo, Enrique;Conventional accounts argue that Spain escaped the Great Depression because its currency was not convertible to gold. Accordingly, when a bank run ensued in 1931, the Banco de España would have been able to lend freely as lender of last resort. Drawing on new archival data on bank balance sheets and discount window borrowing, I show that rapid currency depreciation caused by the reversal in international capital flows that started in 1928 bounded monetary authorities to a dilemma between liquidity assistance and capital mobility during the 1931 crisis. These limits to policy reaction help explain the sharp contraction in bank lending and economic activity during and after 1931.;2020;The limits to lender of last resort interventions in emerging economies: evidence from the Gold Standard and the Great Depression in Spain;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Keller, Wolfgang; Shiue, Carol H.; Wang, Xin";This paper evaluates a well-known approach from the economic history literature that uses grain prices to shed light on interest rates. Although this method has been applied in influential work starting with McCloskey and Nash (Am Econ Rev 74:174–187, 1984) and has potentially wide applicability in situations where interest rates are not available, this paper provides the first analysis of how well the storage cost approach captures actual capital market performance on a number of different dimensions. Using matched data on bank interest rates and grain prices for early 19th century U.S. regions, we find that the storage cost approach is useful for quantifying the performance of capital markets. The storage cost approach captures well regional differences in market performance implied by bank rates data, in terms of both the average interest rates and capital market integration. Moreover, the results are stronger than interest rate figures derived from the bills of exchange rates. The paper also assesses the storage cost approach’s robustness to measurement error, incomplete information, outliers, and other factors.;2020;Capital markets and grain prices: assessing the storage cost approach;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

There is little evidence to suggest that wildcat banking or the failure of the Bank of Ireland to act as a lender of last resort were to blame.

Lithuania and the other Baltic states have largely been ignored by economic historians due to the short time spans of their independence in the interwar period (1918–1940), their relatively small sizes, and the scarcity of data—we attempt to fill this gap in the historical record. As a practical application of our new GDP estimate for 1937, we convert our estimate into 1990 Geary–Khamis dollars so that we can test the hypothesis that Lithuanian economic growth under communism was below average when compared to its European neighbors using data from the Maddison Project. We find that the economic growth rate in Lithuania was above average from 1937 to 1973, even when compared to other communist economies. Alternatively, from 1973 to 1990, growth collapsed and was below average. Using a difference-in-difference strategy we also find a significant GDP per capita penalty for communist countries in Europe over the studied time periods.;2020;A new estimate of Lithuanian GDP for 1937: How does interwar Lithuania compare?;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Kukić, Leonard;Relative to western Europe, we know very little about the determinants of economic growth at the regional level within socialist Europe. This is somewhat unusual, given that socialist policy-makers have put great emphasis on equitable regional development. This article analyses the regional patterns of growth and divergence in socialist Yugoslavia. New estimates of output and inputs are constructed, and an analysis of output growth, factor accumulation, structural modernization, and productivity is provided. Two novel empirical findings are uncovered. The first is that the sources of growth across the regions were fundamentally different. Total factor productivity was a much more important source of growth in the richer regions than it was in the poorer ones. The second finding is that the source of the regional income divergence lies in the failure of the less developed regions to converge towards the employment rates and total factor productivities of the more developed regions. These failures are interpreted, at least partially, as symptoms of the governing objective and the soft budget constraint of the labour-managed firms that operated in Yugoslavia. It is argued that Yugoslavia's development model was less suited to the pre-conditions that prevailed in the less developed parts of the country.;2020;Origins of regional divergence: economic growth in socialist Yugoslavia†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

La Prados De Escosura, Leandro;Spain’s investment boom (1850–1874) has been largely attributed to capital inflows. Sudrià challenged the consensus on the basis of Moro et al. capital balance estimates. Dishoarding of bullion and previous savings would have catered for an increasing investment demand. I argue that the empirical basis for Sudrià's claim is flawed. Moro et al. underestimated the net capital inflow and biased upwards the change in reserves. The current account deficit resulted from an inflow of capital that allowed investment to raise facilitating imports of capital goods and raw materials. Foreign capital contributed significantly to the investment boom.;2020;Foreign capital in 19th century Spain’s investment boom†;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Lilja, Kristina; Jonsson, Pernilla";Drawing on a study of historical national accounts and statistics, this article shows that a growing supply of mass-consumption textiles and clothing in Sweden during industrialization did not fully meet increasing demand. As a result, high demand for second-hand items remained even at the turn of the twentieth century. Records from a local auction house from 1830 to 1900 show that, even in the 1880s, more affluent urban consumers were still active on the second-hand market. Thereafter, they turned to the market for new goods, while potential demand from labourers and servants continued to be provided for by the second-hand market. Mechanization meant that more items entered this market. It changed the range and quality of objects available, consequently affecting the attractiveness of second-hand textiles and clothing. After the 1870s, falling and converging prices can be discerned, while more durable fabrics largely retained their value. We conclude that the consumer revolution (in a broader sense) had by this stage gained a foothold among ordinary Swedish urban households. The auction trade was part of a democratization of consumption. The general lesson is that understanding mass consumption requires research not only into second-hand consumption, but also into different regional settings.;2020;Inadequate supply and increasing demand for textiles and clothing: second-hand trade at auctions as an alternative source of consumer goods in Sweden, 1830–1900;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Lloyd, Simon P.; Solomou, Solomos";We evaluate the effect of the 1932 British General Tariff on the output, labour productivity and employment growth of British industries. We provide a new disaggregated data set that matches industry-level Census of Production data with industry-specific tariff rates to accurately isolate treatment and control groups and estimate the effect of the General Tariff using difference-in-difference regressions. We evaluate a two-group comparison, between newly and non-newly protected industries, and a three-group comparison, between non-newly protected industries and newly protected industries further divided into those given a baseline 10% tariff rate and those given additional tariffs. In the two-group comparison, we identify a tariff effect that is large and statistically significant on output and productivity. In the three-group comparison, we show that the positive output and productivity effects of the tariff arise from the additional tariff protection, over and above the 10% level. These effects are observed over the periods 1930–1935 and 1930–1948, suggesting both short-run and medium-term effects on output and productivity of UK industries protected by the 1932 General Tariff.;2020;The impact of the 1932 General Tariff: a difference-in-difference approach;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Lu, Yi; Luan, Mengna; Sng, Tuan-Hwee";The communist revolution brought unprecedented changes to China. Yet there is no consensus on its role in the history of China’s modern economic growth. We investigate whether local communist party membership affected developmental outcomes from 1957–78 (the Maoist period) and 1978–85 (the reform period). Focusing on Sichuan, China’s most populous province, we use the Long March as an instrument to tease out causal effects. We find that counties with more communist members made larger strides in educational attainment, road construction, and agricultural mechanization during the Maoist period. However, these counties recorded faster output growth only after 1978. Our findings provide empirical support to field studies conducted by sociologists and historians who argue that the communists improved the organizational infrastructure in China’s countryside. Furthermore, we highlight the futility of solving collective action problems without heeding private incentives.;2020;Did the communists contribute to China’s rural growth?;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Luzardo-Luna, Ivan;This article estimates the matching function of the British labour market for the period of 1921–1934. Changes in matching efficiency can explain both employment resilience during the Great Depression and the high structural unemployment throughout the interwar period. Early in the 1920s, matching efficiency improved due to the development of the retail industry. However, the econometric results show a structural break in March 1927, related to a major industrial reshuffling that reduced the demand for workers in staple industries. Since these industries were geographically concentrated, there was an increase in the average distance between the unemployed and vacancies, and matching efficiency declined.;2020;Labour frictions in interwar Britain: industrial reshuffling and the origin of mass unemployment;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"MA, DEBIN; Zhao, Liuyan";This article provides the first systematic econometric study on the evolution of Chinese silver exchange and monetary regimes during the period 1898?1933. Using high-quality datasets of monthly and daily prices of silver dollars, we apply the threshold autoregressive models to estimate the silver points between Shanghai and 18 other cities in northern and central China. We find a noticeable improvement in monetary integration between Shanghai and Tianjin from the 1910s, which then spread to other cities in our sample throughout the 1920s and 1930s. We supplement our analysis with new datasets on volumes and costs of silver flows and with an in-depth historical narrative.

MALANIMA, PAOLO;On the basis of a new series on the consumption of traditional and modern sources of energy between 1820 and 1913, this article addresses the start of modern growth and the great divergence on the world scale. Since the beginning of the nineteenth century, the greater availability of modern energy sources expanded working capacity well beyond the potential of previous agricultural civilizations. Growth of energy consumption rose primarily in western Europe, northern America, and Oceania. As a result, labour productivity rose, leading to an increase in real wages, which was an incentive to replace labour with mechanical engines. The higher energy consumption in these three macro-areas led to global inequality in productive capacity and technology which peaked on the eve of the First World War.;2020;The limiting factor: energy, growth, and divergence, 1820–1913;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Maravall, Laura;This article examines rural settlement in Constantine, a département in French Algeria, at the beginning of the 1900s. By taking into account the timing of colonial settlement for almost 100 municipalities, it shows how the changing geographical conditions and the relative quantities of land and labour shaped the colonial land policy and settler modes of production. As fertile land grew scarcer on the settlement ?frontier?, the ability of settlers to participate in the export market was increasingly dependent on the capacity to make use of modern agricultural techniques that required larger fields and intensive labour. Thus, the outcome of rural settlement was determined by the relative abundance of indigenous labour and the adaptation of the land policy to Algeria's agricultural needs. The results demonstrate that?even within a country itself and during the settlement process?the colonial land policy and settler modes of production change significantly, depending on the region being occupied.;2020;Factor endowments on the ‘frontier’: Algerian settler agriculture at the beginning of the 1900s;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Historical evidence shows that: nobles tended to marry nobles with identical title; and, German marriages were characterized by a higher degree of homogamy in titles than British marriages. Moreover, we show that German data exhibit lower odds of marriage than British among nobles and commoners, and hence provide evidence of a more stratified society. Finally, we propose a diff-in-diff exercise to test the correlation between highly restrictive marriage laws and marital sorting in Germany.";2020;Marriage strategy among the European nobility;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Mares, Isabela; Queralt, Didac";The income tax is a central pillar of the modern fiscal state because of its revenue-raising capacity and administrative sophistication. Existing accounts point to interstate war and class conflict as key drivers of modern fiscal breakthroughs. In this article, we evaluate a third explanation for the origins of fiscal capacity that highlights the importance of intraelite competition for political and economic power in times of rapid industrialization. Modern forms of taxation generated a conflict between industry and agriculture over the distribution of the tax burden across sectors. The presence of electoral institutions that connected tax payments to voting rights created opportunities to overcome this sectoral divide and facilitated the formation of a political consensus for fiscal innovation. The political coalition supporting income tax adoption included higher-income industrial and agricultural elites who anticipated fiscal and electoral gains associated with the adoption of the new tax. Drawing on parliamentary debates in Prussia and additional district-level data, we document both the origins and electoral and economic consequences of the new income tax. We show that the adoption of a highly sophisticated income tax in 1891 shifted the tax burden from land to industry and diluted the political influence of the middle class. The findings clarify the coalitional dynamics leading to fiscal tax adoption in nondemocratic contexts.;2020;Fiscal innovation in nondemocratic regimes: Elites and the adoption of the prussian income taxes of the 1890s⁎;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Mathy, Gabriel P.;The USA in the 1930s experienced unprecedented uncertainty. Uncertainty shocks buffeted the economy during recessionary periods, but these shocks receded during the recovery periods of the Great Depression. Using vector autoregressions on monthly data for 1919–1941, I show that a one standard deviation increase in uncertainty decreased investment, GDP, industrial output, employment, hours worked, wages, and the price level. I perform a historical decomposition simulation to see how much uncertainty shocks mattered for explaining movements in major variables during the Depression. Roughly 40–70% of the simulated decline in output can be explained by uncertainty shocks in the Great Depression.;2020;How much did uncertainty shocks matter in the Great Depression?;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Medina-Albaladejo, Francisco J.; CALATAYUD, SALVADOR";Unequal access to food is one of the main issues in nutritional history, but scarcity of sources has hampered the quantification of this phenomenon. This study uses hospital diets to address this gap. It uses records from between 1852 and 1923 concerning hospital diets in the psychiatric section of the Hospital General de Valencia (Spain), from which it is possible to infer the actual intake of nutrients for six groups of patients and members of staff. The results reveal considerable differences in terms of diet and nutrition. While the most favoured groups (nuns and well-off patients) had by 1852 reduced their relative intake of cereals and increased that of meat, in line with the general trend of the nutritional transition, the poor and orphans were still behind the trend by 1923. Hospital staff were on a high-calorie diet that was adequate for carrying out physically demanding tasks, yet still suffered from a significant deficit in nutrient intake. These inequalities indicate that the nutritional transition was an uneven and non-linear process, with substantial differences according to social group.;2020;Unequal access to food during the nutritional transition: evidence from Mediterranean Spain†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Miladinović, Luka;This article empirically analyses the relationship between nationalism and regional economic integration in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia between the First and the Second World War. It argues that prevailing nationalism had a negative impact on the economic integration of the regions within the Kingdom and further contributed to the political disintegration of the Kingdom. The analysis implies that the ideology of nationalism increased trade costs and thus retarded economic interconnectivity in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, notwithstanding the favorable trade environment and the desire of the central elites to discourage ethnocentric sentiment.;2020;Trade and nationalism: market integration in interwar Yugoslavia*;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Moehling, Carolyn M.; Niemesh, Gregory T.; Thomasson, Melissa A.; Treber, Jaret";In the first two decades of the twentieth century, medical schools increased standards for admission and added basic science to their curricula. During this time period, the probability a new medical school graduate located in a rural area declined by 40%. Using novel data from the American Medical Directories, we find that physicians trained in more rigorous programs with higher admission standards were less likely to set up practice in rural areas. While all physicians were being drawn to metropolitan areas during this period, the pull was stronger for graduates of the higher quality schools. We also find some evidence that physicians trained in the more scientifically and clinically based programs were more strongly attracted to places with more hospitals. These findings suggest that the medical education reforms of the early twentieth century contributed to the urban–rural disparity in access to physician care.;2020;Medical education reforms and the origins of the rural physician shortage;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Montalbo, Adrien;This article investigates the impact of industrial activities on primary instruction in early nineteenth-century France. To do so, I use a newly constituted database on the location and characteristics of primary schools at the level of municipalities. This database is extracted from the Guizot survey conducted in 1833, before the implementation of the first national law making the opening of a school mandatory in any municipality more than 500 inhabitants. By using mineral deposits as an instrument, I first show that the presence of industrial activities in a given municipality was positively influencing the presence of primary schools. An increase in the supply of schools by municipalities explains this association. Additional resources transferred to them by manufactures favoured this increase through an income effect. However, I find no significant link between industry and the accumulation of human capital. On the contrary, I provide indications that industrial activities were associated with lower enrolment rates. If they had a positive impact on the demand for schooling, it was only for a very restricted part of the population.;2020;Industrial activities and primary schooling in early nineteenth-century France;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Murray, John E.; Silvestre, Javier";"This article analyses coal market integration in Europe over the long nineteenth century. The market integration of coal, a key commodity associated with the industrial revolution, is an aspect of European economic history that has received little attention. The literature on the evolution of markets has concentrated on agricultural products, mostly cereals. This article examines intra- and international market integration in the principal coal-producing countries, Britain, Germany, France, and Belgium; and adds three main consuming southern European countries to the analysis of the international market. It provides new evidence on prices, as well as trade, and uses a straightforward approach to address coal price behaviour. Despite shocks, clear trends toward integration in both domestic and international markets can be observed, even if by one of our measures the latter started at a later date. Processes of market integration, however, seemed to slow from the end of the nineteenth century. Explanations are offered as to the causes of the extent and timing of integrations: reductions, mainly, in transportation costs, but also in information costs, and, in the international market, protectionism. The influence of cartels, on the other hand, may have been limited, particularly in the international market.";2020;Integration in European coal markets, 1833–1913†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Norling, Johannes;Demonstrations, rallies, boycotts, and other forms of protest were common under apartheid in South Africa. Using a compilation of more than 150 geocoded protests between 1948 and 1990, this paper compares people affected and unaffected by protests at every age throughout childhood. Exposure to protests before age 14 was associated with 2.7 percent fewer years of completed schooling. This difference was larger following violent protests, and for African residents of South Africa. On the other hand, people who experienced protests as children were up to 6.9 percent more likely to be employed as adults. The paper considers social solidarity as a possible channel connecting protests to changes in education and employment, and finds that places that had more protests during apartheid had lower reported levels of trust and physical safety in the years after apartheid ended.;2020;Education and employment following apartheid protests;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"O'Brien, Patrick K.; Palma, Nuno";The Bank Restriction Act of 1797 was the unconventional monetary policy of its time. It suspended the convertibility of the Bank of England's notes into gold, a policy that lasted until 1821. The current historical consensus is that it was a result of the state's need to finance the war, France’s remonetization, a loss of confidence in the English country banks, and a run on the Bank of England’s reserves following a landing of French troops in Wales. We argue that while these factors help us understand the timing of the suspension, they cannot explain its success. We deploy new long-term data that leads us to a complementary explanation: the policy succeeded thanks to the reputation of the Bank of England, achieved through a century of prudential collaboration between the Bank and the Treasury.;2020;Danger to the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street?

"Oliver, Michael J.; RUTTERFORD, JANETTE";This article describes how and why the Thatcher government introduced index-linked gilts in 1981. It outlines the earlier deliberations by the monetary authorities during the 1950s and 1960s on how an indexed government security might help or hinder the fight against inflation. Although these discussions came to nothing, rising inflation and increasing difficulties with managing the gilt-edged market during the 1970s revived interest in the indexation of government securities. Both the Page Commission in 1974 and the Wilson Report in 1980 recommended the introduction of inflation-indexed securities, but the election of the Conservative government in 1979 gave real momentum to their possible issuance. Although Margaret Thatcher was initially opposed to indexation, Nigel Lawson galvanized the Treasury and the Bank of England to work on a scheme to issue index-linked gilts as a means of improving economic performance. The article traces the contentious series of discussions surrounding the possible effects of index-linked gilts on government debt interest costs, on monetary policy and monetary targets, and on the possible ?crowding out? of corporate bonds and equities which could not offer a guaranteed real return. Despite teething problems, the introduction of inflation-linked bonds in the UK was deemed a success.;2020;‘The capital market is dead’: the difficult birth of index-linked gilts in the UK;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Using novel living costs data, we compute two estimates of income leadership: welfare ratios and purchasing–power–parity-adjusted GDP per capita. Australia started considerably below the UK and the USA but by the 1870s, it had overtaken the former and had almost done so for the latter, due to relatively rapid labour productivity growth and a steep decline in living costs. Still, in the 1870s Australia was not the world income leader, but a close second.;2020;Living costs and living standards: Australian development 1820–1870†;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Pfister, Ulrich;"Novel information on land rent is used to estimate the income side of German net national product (NNP) in 1851–1913 without recourse to output side aggregates. The new series shows higher values during the initial part of the period of observation, which narrows the wedge that opens up between existing estimates of NNP before the 1880s. The results support a modified Crafts–Harley view of the first phase of German industrialization: despite rapid catch-up growth of industrial leading sectors from the 1840s to the 1870s, the pace of aggregate growth accelerated only gradually. The initially small size of the modern sector and the simultaneity of the first phase of industrialization and the first wave of globalization account for this paradox. The labor share remained largely constant; the decline of the land share in NNP was compensated by a rise of the capital share.";2020;The Crafts–Harley view of German industrialization: an independent estimate of the income side of net national product, 1851–1913;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

RAHMAN, AHMED S.;This article examines how the regional distribution of US military personnel contributed to military expenditures around the country. We first discuss a theory of political economy for military spending?officers who remain in service can eventually help channel military funds and employment to their respective regions of origin, through direct military spending decisions or indirect political channels. Further, if officer retention is positively related to less industrialization at home (fewer work opportunities at home induce greater service lengths), this channel will induce greater progressiveness in military spending. To test these ideas we use the personnel records of officers serving in the US Navy from 1870 to the late 1930s. Tracking the tenure of all officers, we construct measures of ?military representation? across US counties. Through ordinary least squares, Tobit, and instrumental variable approaches, we find that senior naval officer representation across regions positively and robustly predicts regional naval spending (but not spending from other branches) during the Second World War.;2020;Officer retention and military spending: the rise of the military-industrial complex during the Second World War;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Income inequality was relatively moderate in 1865, while famine (1867–1868) decreased it further. Income inequality increased substantially during the late nineteenth century, then declined during WWI and its aftermath, followed by another increase in inequality in the late 1920s that was halted by the Great Depression. The rising level of inequality before WWI fits well with the ideas of the Kuznets curve and maximum inequality, whereas the decline in inequality was due to shocks (e.g., civil war).;2020;A Kuznets rise and a Piketty fall: income inequality in Finland, 1865–1934;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Rouanet, Louis; Piano, Ennio E.";Many economists have analyzed the efficiency of a volunteered army relative to a conscripted army. However, they have rarely studied the working of real-world alternative, market-based, military institutions where exemptions from military service are traded among the citizens. This paper fills this gap by studying the rise and fall of the Remplacement Militaire in the eighteenth and the nineteenth century France. This system endured for more than three quarters of a century until the French government progressively moved toward universal conscription after 1872. At times of military expansion, the State regulated the replacement market. We argue that the goal of such regulations was to limit the increase in fraud and avoid a deterioration in the quality of the soldiery associated with increases in the price of replacements.;2020;Filling the ranks: the Remplacement Militaire in post-revolutionary France;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

We consider the consequences of using OCCSCORE when researchers are interested in earnings regressions. We estimate race and gender earnings gaps in modern decennial Censuses as well as the 1915 Iowa State Census. Using OCCSCORE biases results towards zero and can result in estimated gaps of the wrong sign. We use a machine learning approach to construct a new adjusted score based on industry, occupation, and demographics. The new income score provides estimates closer to earnings regressions. Lastly, we consider the consequences for estimates of intergenerational mobility elasticities.;2020;A machine learning approach to improving occupational income scores;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Schneider, Eric B.;Economic historians have long been aware of many forms of bias that could lead to spurious causal inferences. However, our approach to these biases has been muddled at times by dealing with each bias separately and by confusion about the sources of bias and how to mitigate them. This paper shows how the methodology of directed acyclical graphs (DAGs) formulated by Pearl (2009) and particularly the concept of collider bias can provide economic historians with a unified approach to managing a wide range of biases that can distort causal inference. I present ten examples of collider bias drawn from economic history research, focussing mainly on examples where the authors were able to overcome or mitigate the bias. Thus, the paper addresses how to diagnose collider bias and also strategies for managing it. The paper also shows that quasi-random experimental designs are rarely able to overcome collider bias. Although all of these biases were understood by economic historians before, conceptualising them as collider bias will improve economic historians’ understanding of the limitations of particular sources and help us develop better research designs in the future.;2020;Collider bias in economic history research;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Siodla, James;Although municipal budgets fared well on average during the Great Depression, many suffered greatly. In newspapers and trade publications, observers blamed distress in real estate markets as well as the rise in tax delinquency and real debt obligations. This paper uses a sample of large US cities to estimate how those factors influenced municipal revenue and expenditures during the Depression. Results show that city finances were stable when facing the housing market distress that plagued many urban areas in the 1930s. The principal elements of fiscal strain were actually rising delinquency, which was associated with diminished revenue and operating expenditures, and growing real debt obligations, which were associated with reduced capital outlays. Thus local budgets were driven more by the behavior of taxpayers and obligations to city creditors than by the downturn in real estate markets. These findings illuminate municipal governments’ responses to the fiscal strain wrought by the Depression.;2020;Debt and taxes: Fiscal strain and US city budgets during the Great Depression;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The article argues that recurrent outbreaks of scab disease depressed sheep population and wool production levels until the early 1330s. The disease, coupled with warfare and taxation, also had a decisive role in depressing the volumes of wool exports. Despite this fact, wool merchants were still conducting business with major wool producers, who desperately needed access to the capital to replenish their flocks.;2020;Mites and merchants: the crisis of English wool and textile trade revisited, c. 1275–1330†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Investment trusts employed global rather than domestic diversification. The early predominant investment in bonds in the 1880s gradually declined in favour of ordinary and preferred shares. North and Latin American markets were the main geographical target of UK investment trusts, with less appetite for domestic investments and negligible interest in continental European financial securities.

The results show that African prices were only a small fraction of competitive prices, implying an annual loss of almost 2 percent of GDP during colonial rule.;2020;Measuring extractive institutions: colonial trade and price gaps in French Africa;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Tan, Hui Ren;I exploit discontinuous changes in the likelihood of military service induced by the transition between different registration regimes under the World War I draft to determine if wartime service affected economic outcomes.

It argues that political fragmentation explains why medieval Europe was more innovative than the Roman world, invoking a comparison with imperial China to complement the analysis. The technological success of China under the Tang and Song shows that political fragmentation is not a precondition for progress.

This study empirically outlines the role of comparative resource advantages between 1750 and 1856, using trade data from the Sound Toll Registers Online. On the one hand, the results show the significance of relative land abundance for trade patterns between the Baltic Sea region and North-Western Europe: the land abundant Baltic Sea region was overall exporting more land-intensive commodities. On the other hand, however, the results also show a seeming paradox: increasing trade openness during the nineteenth century was not associated with a higher degree of specialization along these comparative advantages.;2020;Factor endowments and international trade: a study of land embodied in trade on the Baltic Sea region, 1750–1856;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Unger, Richard W.;Estimates of energy consumed from different carriers in England in 1300 and in 1450 indicates limited increases in consumption in the wake of the large population change after the Great Death. Adjustments in relative use of energy sources, to be expected, yielded variations without apparent structural changes. Indications of some pressure on existing land resources in 1300 suggest energy supplies did constrain growth in the economy, though unexploited options to overcome the pressure did exist. The expectation of profligate use of newly relatively abundant energy in 1450 was not realized. By 1450, output per unit of energy consumed surprisingly rose relative to 1300, indicating efficiency improvements.;2020;English energy consumption and the impact of the Black Death*;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Varian, Brian D.;This article constructs indicators of revealed comparative advantage for 18 British manufacturing industries for the years 1880, 1890, and 1900. These indicators constitute the earliest systematic measurements of the relative performance of British industries. The indicators are then employed in a four-factor Heckscher–Ohlin model of trade, with the factors being capital, labour, material inputs, and human capital. Contrary to the previous literature, the manufacturing comparative advantages of late-Victorian Britain were not in the relatively labour-intensive industries. By 1890, there was a distinctly labour-economizing regime within British manufacturing. Contributing to this pattern of within-sector specialization were emigration from Britain and the full absorption of displaced agricultural labour into the manufacturing sector. This article concludes with the suggestion that, in the late-Victorian era, British and American manufacturing were not so dissimilar, at least relative to Continental manufacturing.;2020;The manufacturing comparative advantages of late-Victorian Britain;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Evidence of 4,300 work tasks undertaken by particular women and men was collected from three types of court documents (coroners? reports, church court depositions, and quarter sessions examinations) from five counties in south-western England (Cornwall, Devon, Hampshire, Somerset, and Wiltshire) between 1500 and 1700. The findings show that women participated in all the main areas of the economy. However, different patterns of gendered work were identified in different parts of the economy: craft work showed a sharp division of labour and agriculture a flexible division of labour, while differences of gender were less pronounced in everyday commerce. Quantitative evidence of early modern housework and care work in England indicates that such work used less time and was less family-based than is often assumed. Comparisons with gendered work patterns in early modern Germany and Sweden are drawn and show strong similarities to England. In conclusion it is argued that the gender division of labour cannot be explained by a single factor, as different influences were at play in different parts of the economy.;2020;The gender division of labour in early modern England;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Withington, Phil;In 1600 the word ?consumption? was a term of medical pathology describing the ?wasting, petrification of things?. By 1700 it was also a term of economic discourse: ?In commodities, the value rises as its quantity is less and vent greater, which depends upon it being preferred in its consumption?. The article traces the emergence of this key category of economic analysis to debates over the economy in the 1620s and subsequent disputes over the excise tax, showing how ?consumption? was an early term in the developing lexicon of political economy. In so doing the article demonstrates the important role of ?intoxicants??that is, addictive and intoxicating commodities like alcohols and tobaccos?in shaping these early meanings and uses of ?consumption?. It outlines the discursive importance of intoxicants, both as the foci for discussions of ?superfluous? and ?necessary? consumption and the target of legislation on consumption. It argues that while these discussions had an ideological dimension, or dimensions, they were also responses to material increases in the volume and diversity of intoxicants in early seventeenth-century England. By way of conclusion the article suggests the significance of the Low Countries as a point of reference for English writers, as well as a more capacious and semantically sensitive approach to changes in early modern consumption practices.;2020;Intoxicants and the invention of ‘consumption’;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
You, Xuesheng;This article uses a new source of data, namely the full sample of the 1881 census enumerators? books, to study female labour force participation. It examines the interaction between labour demand and supply to gauge their relative importance in determining female labour force participation rates (LFPRs). Three main findings emerge from the current article. First, there is an unmistakable link between labour demand and female LFPRs. High levels of female labour force participation are found in areas where there were industries with ample demand for female labour. Second, supply-side factors also had clear effects on female LFPRs. However, they can only operate within the limit imposed by the demand-side conditions. Third, female migration did not fundamentally change the spatial patterns of female LFPRs. Overall, this article argues that the demand side of the female labour market was the most important factor in determining female LFPRs in nineteenth-century England and Wales.;2020;Women's labour force participation in nineteenth-century England and Wales: evidence from the 1881 census enumerators’ books;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Zwart, Pim de; Lucassen, Jan";This article introduces a new dataset on wages in northern India (from Gujarat in the west to Bengal in the east) from the 1590s to the 1870s. It follows Allen's subsistence basket methodology to compute internationally comparable real wages to shed light on developments in Indian living standards over time. It adjusts the comparative cost-of-living indices to take into account differences in climate and caloric intake due to variances in heights. The article also discusses the male/female wage gap in northern India. It demonstrates that the ?great divergence? started in the late seventeenth century, and widened further after the 1720s and especially after the 1800s. It was subsequently primarily England's spurt and India's stagnation in the first half of the nineteenth century that brought about most serious differences in the standard of living. If the British colonial state is to blame?as often suggested by the literature on India's persistent poverty?the fault lies in its failure to improve the situation after the British became near-undisputed masters of India in 1820.;2020;Poverty or prosperity in northern India?

"Abad, Leticia Arroyo; Maurer, Noel; Sánchez-Alonso, Blanca";Millions of immigrants chose Argentina as the land of opportunity during the era of mass migration. Two immigrant groups, Italian and Spanish, dominated the immigration flows. Despite higher literacy and a common language, Spaniards fared worse when compared to Italians in Buenos Aires. By 1895, Italians enjoyed higher wages. What explains their differential paths in the city of Buenos Aires? This study finds that the Italian community capitalized on pre-existing cultural traditions to establish denser and more effective networks to match their compatriots with economic opportunities.

"Aboagye, Prince Young; Bolt, Jutta";This paper contributes to a growing literature on long-term trends and drivers of pre-industrial inequality by providing new stylized facts on the evolution of income inequality in Ghana from 1891 to 1960. Using newly constructed social tables, we estimate the Gini coefficient for seven consecutive decades at a time in which the adoption and expansion of cocoa cultivation transformed the Ghanaian economy. Income inequality was already high in 1891, prior to the spread of cocoa cultivation, and it remained stable for four decades. Following a small decline in the early 1930s, inequality increased, reaching its highest level at the end of the colonial era. The expansion of cocoa cultivation and increasing cocoa incomes contributed to persistent high inequality levels until the 1930s. By contrast, the increase in inequality from 1930 to 1960 was largely due to the rising incomes of government employees, skilled workers, and commercial workers.;2021;Long-term trends in income inequality: Winners and losers of economic change in Ghana, 1891–1960;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"ACHESON, GRAEME G.; CAMPBELL, GARETH; Gallagher, Áine; Turner, John D.";The early twentieth century saw the British capital market reach a state of maturity before any of its global counterparts. This coincided with more women participating directly in the stock market. This study analyses whether these female shareholders chose to invest independently of men. Using a novel dataset of almost 500,000 shareholders in some of the largest British railways, it shows that women were much more likely to be solo shareholders than men. There is also evidence that they prioritized their independence above other considerations such as where they invested or how diversified they could be.;2021;Independent women: investing in British railways, 1870–1922†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Ahmed, Faisal Z.;Recent studies suggest that Muslim military conquest (632–1100 CE) generated an institutional equilibrium with deleterious long-run political economy effects. This equilibrium was predicated on mamluk institutions: the use of elite slave soldiers (mamluks) and non-hereditary property rights over agricultural lands to compensate them (iqta). This paper evaluates this historical narrative by exploring the accuracy of its initial step. Using a difference-in-differences strategy, I show that conquest changed institutions in conquered territories. I then provide suggestive evidence that the presence and efficacy of mamluk institutions affected this institutional configuration and that leaders survived longer in power during the conquest period.;2021;Muslim conquest and institutional formation;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Albers, Hakon; Pfister, Ulrich";Market integration of European inland regions such as Germany caught up on North-Western Europe from the seventeenth century onwards. As many studies rely on grain prices and the pre-industrial era was a period of climate change, a relevant question is in how far changing weather shocks impact on the measurement of convergence trends. We create a new high-quality grain price dataset and apply four methodologies to quantify market integration robust to weather shocks and climate change. Population growth and river transport turn out as plausible explanations for price convergence rather than climate change.;2021;Climate change, weather shocks, and price convergence in pre-industrial Germany;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Because of the uncertain availability of these sources, the contract provided flexibility to both parties and legal assistance to the banker who reported to accountants for audit and, if necessary, the charge of an interest at about 1 percent per month.;2021;Asientos as sinews of war in the composite superpower of the 16th century;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Amini, Shima; Toms, Steven";This article considers how international economic expansion impacts on the composition of elite groups on boards of companies. We examine, why, at the height of the British Empire, boards of national, imperial, and international railway companies, financed from London, were dominated by elites drawn differentially from the aristocracy, the military, finance, and politics. To investigate the reasons for these differences, we conduct a social network analysis of railway company boards in three countries during the second half of the nineteenth century. Results reveal that aristocratic directors were dominant in Britain, military directors in India, and financier directors in Argentina, suggesting that their influence drew on local knowledge, resource access, and network connections. They did not serve on boards for merely ornamental purposes.;2021;Elite directors, London finance, and British overseas expansion: Victorian railway networks, 1860–1900†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Anderson, Peter;The effect of unions on workers? wage premiums for accepting on-the-job accident risk is a prominent subset of compensating differentials research. This article contributes to the literature by using a newly-constructed balanced panel of railwaymen working in the traffic departments of three prominent Edwardian railway companies with operations in England and Wales. It avoids previous issues of endogeneity by controlling for a number of variables correlated with the risk rates, notably individual fixed effects. The results show that the largest railway union of the time, the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants, was able to transform growing union density into power that increased wage premiums for fatal accident risk, although railwaymen's wages did not compensate them for non-fatal accident risk. This article also considers how this relationship differed by varying levels of company-specific human capital as measured by tenure. It finds a non-linear relationship for both risk rates across the tenure cohorts.;2021;Unions and compensating wage differentials for workplace accident risk: the English and Welsh railway industry, 1902–12†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Annaert, Jan; Verdickt, Gertjan";In 1836, Société Générale created the world's first closed-end equity fund, Mutualité Industrielle. It promised to be a diversification tool targeted towards less-wealthy investors. We confirm that the trust's returns were indeed better than returns on synthetic portfolios such investors had access to. However, it never became a commercial success. This paper presents a possible rational explanation why this innovation was liquidated in 1873. First, we show that the trust offered a performance similar to randomly-selected portfolios. Second, portfolio strategies to which mostly wealthy and sophisticated investors had access were able to outperform the trust. Mutualité Industrielle's failure to offer a sufficiently attractive alternative to investors is consistent with its difficulty to attract sufficient funds to keep the trust in business.;2021;Go active or stay passive: Investment trust, financial innovation and diversification in Belgium's early days;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Arimoto, Yutaka; Lee, Changmin";This paper examines whether the influx of Japanese establishments in colonial Korea during the 1930s suppressed the entry of Korean establishments. We construct new subsector–county-level panel data to exploit variations across counties within subsectors. We find that Korean entry rates were higher in counties with a higher presence of Japanese establishments. However, the spillover effects do vary across subsectors, and we find suggestive evidence of negative impacts of Japanese presence in subsectors with more large-scaled establishments. Taken together, Japanese establishments did seem to raise entry barriers in some subsectors but also functioned as a catalyst for Korean entry in other subsectors.;2021;Domestic industrialization under colonization: evidence from Korea, 1932–1940;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Arthi, Vellore; Parman, John M.";How might COVID-19 affect human capital and wellbeing in the long run? The COVID-19 pandemic has already imposed a heavy human cost—taken together, this public health crisis and its attendant economic downturn appear poised to dwarf the scope, scale, and disruptiveness of most modern pandemics. What evidence we do have about other modern pandemics is largely limited to short-run impacts. Consequently, recent experience can do little to help us anticipate and respond to COVID-19’s potential long-run impact on individuals over decades and even generations. History, however, offers a solution. Historical crises offer closer analogues to COVID-19 in each of its key dimensions—as a global pandemic, as a global recession—and offer the runway necessary to study the life-course and intergenerational outcomes. In this paper, we review the evidence on the long-run effects on health, labor, and human capital of both historical pandemics (with a focus on the 1918 Influenza Pandemic) and historical recessions (with a focus on the Great Depression). We conclude by discussing how past crises can inform our approach to COVID-19—helping tell us what to look for, what to prepare for, and what data we ought to collect now.;2021;Disease, downturns, and wellbeing: Economic history and the long-run impacts of COVID-19;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Bartolomé Rodríguez, Isabel; González-Mariscal, Manuel";Fuelwood was the main domestic fuel in the Mediterranean Basin during the early modern age, although the consumption level was lower than in other latitudes. The calculation of annual real prices and per capita household consumption figures in Seville from 1518 to 1775 reveals a complex evolution connected to a European-wide scenario. As expected, low levels of domestic fuelwood use were maintained in accordance with climate and heating requirements, but contrary to prior assumptions, a substantial increase is evidenced as of 1630. The growing supply of firewood from tree-crops, leading to a decrease in real prices, ran parallel to an early diet shift to pulses and the corresponding extension of cooking times.;2021;The domestic consumption of firewood in preindustrial Seville, 1518–1775.

"Baubeau, Patrice; Monnet, Eric; Riva, Angelo; Ungaro, Stefano";Despite France's importance in the interwar world economy, the scale of the French banking crises of 1930?1 and their consequences have never been fully assessed quantitatively. The lack of banking regulation severely limited the availability of balance sheet data. Using a new dataset of individual balance sheets from more than 300 banks, this article shows that the crises were much more severe than previously thought, although they did not affect the main commercial banks. By reconstructing financial flows, this study shows that the fall in bank credit was mostly driven by a flight-to-safety by deposits, from banks to savings institutions and the central bank. The decrease in bank deposits due to bank runs was offset by an increase in deposits with savings institutions, with the central bank, and in cash hoarding, whereas the decrease in bank credit was not offset by an increase in loans from non-bank financial institutions. In line with the gold standard mentality, cash deposited with savings institutions and the central bank was used to decrease marketable public debt and increase gold reserves, rather than pursuing countercyclical policies. Despite massive capital inflows and rising aggregate money supply, France suffered from a severe, persistent credit crunch.;2021;Flight-to-safety and the credit crunch: a new history of the banking crises in France during the Great Depression†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Bellou, Andriana; Cardia, Emanuela";The life-cycle labor supply of women born at the turn of the 20th century diverged sharply from previous cohorts. Although they had similar participation rates in early adulthood, younger cohorts were significantly more likely to work at middle age. This paper documents a link between these changing patterns of female labor supply and the Great Depression. We find that the onset of the Great Depression led to an increase in young women's employment in 1930 via an added-worker effect. Cohorts induced into the workforce in the early 1930s had significantly higher employment rates through the 1940s and 1950s of up to 3 percentage points, suggesting a permanent impact of the Great Depression on women's lifecycle labor supply.;2021;The Great Depression and the rise of female employment: A new hypothesis;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Billington, Stephen D.;A recent re-evaluation of patenting during the British Industrial Revolution argues patentees were responsive to demand-side conditions. This view does not consider supply-side factors, such as a patentee’s skill or access to financial resources, as an alternative mechanism. I exploit a rich dataset of patentee occupations to investigate the role a patentee’s economic or social background played in their patenting behaviour. I find skilled patentees were intensive users of the patent system and frequently patented more economically valuable inventions. I also find patent value mattered more than patentee skill for patent extension, which likely indicates the existence of financiers willing to back the acquisition of patents for valuable inventions. The composition of Britain’s patentees, and their use of the system, reasonably relates to the value of the inventions they sought to protect.;2021;What explains patenting behaviour during Britain’s Industrial Revolution?;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Bogart, Dan; Dunn, Oliver; Alvarez-Palau, Eduard J.; SHAW-TAYLOR, LEIGH";There is a debate about whether coastal shipping experienced substantial productivity growth prior to the advent of steam power. To study changes over the long eighteenth century, this article uses thousands of coastal journey times culled from Board of Trade crew lists between 1835 and 1844 and coastal port books for the mid-to-late 1600s, along with a newly digitized coastal network. Comparisons between matched samples show that journey speeds, defined as miles sailed per day, were significantly higher in the crew lists compared to the port books, and that voyage cycle times, defined as days between starting two identical voyages, were substantially lower. The study also shows that voyage times in the east coast coal trade were substantially lower around 1840 than around 1700, but the difference was much smaller when peace years are compared. These new data imply that total factor productivity growth in the east coast coal trade was significant, especially if one accounts for gains from peace after 1815. The findings contribute to the larger literature studying the rate and sources of productivity growth during the industrial revolution.;2021;Speedier delivery: coastal shipping times and speeds during the Age of Sail †;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Borcan, Oana; Olsson, Ola; Putterman, Louis";It has often been observed that the emergence of states in a region is typically preceded by an earlier transition to agricultural production. Using new data on the date of first state emergence within contemporary countries, we present a global scale analysis of the chronological relationship between the transition to agriculture and the subsequent emergence of states. We find statistically significant relationships between early reliance on agriculture and state age in all sub-samples and also when we use alternative sources of data at different levels of geographical aggregation. A one millennium earlier transition to agriculture among non-pristine states predicts a 317-430 year earlier state emergence. We uncover differences in cases where states were imposed from outside or when they emerged through internal origination. The agriculture-state lag is on average 3.1 millennia in internally originated (including pristine) states, and 2.7 millennia in externally originated states. We also explore some of the mechanisms through which agriculture is believed to have influenced the emergence of states. Our results indicate that the rise of social classes was often an intermediate step towards the presence of early states.;2021;Transition to agriculture and first state presence: A global analysis;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

We find that loan supply shocks contributed negatively to output growth between 1931 and 1933, at the same time as the U.S. experienced several waves of banking crises. Thus, our results support the view that disruptions in credit availability contributed to the depth and length of the Great Depression.

BUCCIFERRO, JUSTIN R.;"Impending abolition of slavery in Brazil during the late nineteenth century meant the potential shortage of labor for southeast coffee planters.

To what extent was the program successful in capping the wage bill of planters after emancipation? How did the occupational distribution by race change as compared to other regions without such a program? Consolidated evidence on wages and the value of output indicates that the return to labor actually increased after abolition, as did rural and urban employment segregation in favor of whites over blacks; in contrast, economic growth elsewhere in the Americas was more subdued and alternatives like sharecropping prevailed.

Visual analysis of this new dataset suggests that an important factor linked to the expansion of schooling was the feminization of the teaching profession, something that has been largely neglected so far in quantitative historical studies of educational development. This hypothesis is put to the test using panel-data models. The results show that the feminization of teaching went hand in hand with the rise of schooling rates by prompting more girls to enrol into primary education. By the beginning of the twentieth century, Italy's gross enrolment rate had surpassed that of Spain?partly as the result of increasing feminization within the primary-school teaching profession.;2021;Female teachers and the rise of primary education in Italy and Spain, 1861–1921: evidence from a new dataset†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Cappelli, Gabriele; Vasta, Michelangelo";This paper explores the evolution of the human capital gender gap in Liberal Italy (1871–1921). First, we show that Italy lagged some 50 years behind more advanced countries like France, Prussia and the UK, and that the regional divide in gendered literacy was unparalleled in the rest of Europe. Next, we test whether the shift to primary-school centralization in 1911 (the Daneo-Credaro Reform) brought about a decisive improvement in female literacy. We rely on a brand new, cross-sectional micro (municipal)-dataset of literacy rates in 1911 and 1921, as well as their potential determinants around 1911. Such data, combined with propensity score matching to improve identification, show that primary-school centralization increased the average annual growth of female literacy by 0.78 percentage points. Thus, even though the Reform did not aim at girls specifically, it brought about the unintended consequences of more rapid human capital accumulation for women and—ceteris paribus—a reduced educational gender gap. We briefly discuss why this “Silent Revolution” likely had important implications for Italy’s economic history.;2021;A “Silent Revolution”: school reforms and Italy’s educational gender gap in the Liberal Age (1861–1921);Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Chankrajang, Thanyaporn; Vechbanyongratana, Jessica";This study evaluates women's de jure and de facto land rights and their implications for household welfare in nineteenth-century Bangkok. Women constituted a significant share of agricultural landowners holding government-issued land deeds in central Siam (now Thailand)?a pattern that stands in contrast to both historical and contemporary developing economy contexts where the structure of land rights often favours men. The findings show, through both direct and indirect evidence, that women's de jure rights were upheld in practice. Women made significantly more agricultural investments than male or mixed-gender owners, which supports the assertion that women perceived their land rights as secure under Siam's traditional usufruct land rights system. An assessment of land-related court cases directly supports our claim, showing that women in Siam had access to legal representation and were protected when their land rights were challenged by investors and local elites in the context of high demand for both agricultural and urban land. Such secure land rights helped preserve women's livelihoods as agriculturists and household well-being. We estimate that the median female-owned orchard could support 10 adults annually, achieving a standard of living comparable to unskilled labourer households in Beijing and Milan during the same period.;2021;Land, ladies, and the law: a case study on women's land rights and welfare in Southeast Asia in the nineteenth century†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Charles, Amélie; Darné, Olivier";In this paper, we investigate the relationship between output volatility and growth using the standard GARCH-M framework and the US monthly industrial production index (IPI) for the period January 1919–December 2017, by taking into account the presence of shocks and variance changes. The results show that the IPI growth is strongly affected by large shocks which are associated with strikes in some industries, recessions, World War II and natural disasters. We also identify several subperiods with different level of volatility where the volatility declines along the subperiods, with the pre-WWII period (1919–1946) the highest volatile period and the aftermath period of the GFC (2010–2017) the lowest volatile period. We find no evidence of relationship between output volatility and its growth during the full sample 1919–2017 and also for all the subperiods. From a macroeconomic point of view, this implies that economic performances, as measured by IPI growth, do not depend on the uncertainty as measured by IPI volatility.;2021;Econometric history of the growth–volatility relationship in the USA: 1919–2017;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Chiswick, Barry R.; Robinson, RaeAnn Halenda";Estimated labor force participation rates among free women in the pre-Civil War period were exceedingly low. This is due, in part, to cultural or societal expectations of the role of women and the lack of thorough enumeration by Census takers. This paper develops an augmented labor force participation rate for free women in 1860 and compares it with the augmented rate for 1920 and today. Our methodology identifies women who are likely providing informal and unenumerated labor for market production in support of a family business, that is, unreported family workers. These individuals are not coded in the original data as formally working, but are likely to be engaged in the labor force on the basis of the self-employment of other relatives in their household. Unreported family workers are classified into four categories: farm, merchant, craft, and boardinghouse keepers. Using microdata, the inclusion of these workers more than triples the free female labor force participation rate in the 1860 Census from 16 percent to 57 percent, more than doubles the participation rate in the 1920 Census from 24 percent to 50 percent, and has a small effect on the currently measured rate of 56 percent (2015-2019 American Community Survey). This suggests that rather than a steep rise from a very low level in the female labor force participation rate since 1860, it has in fact always been high and fairly stable over time. In contrast, the effect of including unreported family workers in the male augmented labor force participation rate is relatively small.;2021;Women at work in the United States since 1860: An analysis of unreported family workers;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Cox, Gary W.; Figueroa, Valentín";Prominent scholars argue that Europe’s political fragmentation improved the security of property rights, thereby promoting growth. We explore a complementary mechanism: urban fragmentation—the proliferation of self-governing cities—helped emancipate labor, and freer labor promoted both faster and more correlated town growth. To test these hypotheses, we first show that polities with more self-governing cities offered more protection to runaway serfs against lordly recapture. We then show that more fragmented areas exhibited both faster and more correlated urban growth. While both the property rights and labor freedom mechanisms predict faster growth, only the latter predicts more highly correlated growth.;2021;Political fragmentation, rural-to-urban migration and urban growth patterns in western Eurasia, 800–1800;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Davenport, Romola J.;"In a recent article in this journal I challenged Szreter and Mooney's account of a mortality crisis in English industrial and manufacturing cities in the period c. 1830?1850. I argued, first, that there was no robust evidence for a major fall in urban life expectancies in this period; second, that there was evidence for a rise in mortality in early childhood, but that this rise occurred in rural as well as urban populations, and persisted until the 1860s; and third, that an increase in virulence of scarlet fever made a major contribution to this rise. Szreter and Mooney contested these conclusions on two main grounds: that my methodology for estimating urban life expectancies differed from theirs; and that the geography and chronology of scarlet fever patterns did not fit those of early childhood mortality. Here I demonstrate that these criticisms are invalid. Using their methodology I still find no evidence for a dramatic drop in urban life expectancies in the 1830s?40s. I also present new evidence that scarlet fever was a major cause of childhood mortality by the late 1830s and 1840s, in rural as well as urban populations, and could therefore account for the observed rise in early childhood mortality in this period.";2021;Nineteenth-century mortality trends: a reply to Szreter and Mooney†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Delabastita, Vincent; Buyst, Erik";Research on the intergenerational inheritance of occupational attainment has been restricted to sons for a long time. This is remarkable, given the ubiquity of historical settings where female labor force participation was high. This study of civil marriage certificates in nineteenth-century West Flanders investigates a comprehensive sample covering the economic activities not only of fathers and sons but also of mothers and daughters. We find that daughters were more mobile than sons. Daughters, however, enjoyed less growth in terms of intergenerational mobility against the background of a slowly industrializing economy.;2021;Intergenerational mobility of sons and daughters: evidence from nineteenth-century West Flanders;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Donna, Javier D.; Espín-Sánchez, José-Antonio";For centuries, irrigation communities in south-eastern Spain were socially stable and economically efficient. In this article, we show how these self-governing institutions persisted by resolving conflicts over scarce resources with flexible punishment for water theft. We argue that variable penalties for violating irrigation rules provided social insurance to farmers during droughts. We develop a dynamic model in which judges trade off crime deterrence and social insurance, and test its predictions using a novel dataset on water theft in the self-governed irrigation community of Mula, Spain, from 1851 to 1948. For the same offence, we show that recidivists were punished more harshly than first-time offenders. When the defendant was wealthy, as indicated by the honorific title don, or the victim was poor, judgements were stricter.;2021;Water theft as social insurance: south-eastern Spain, 1851–1948†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Ekama, Kate; Fourie, Johan; Heese, Hans; Martin, Lisa-Cheree";When the enslaved were emancipated across the British Empire in 1834, slave-owners received cash compensation, and four years of unpaid labour as the former slaves became apprentices. In the Cape Colony, appraisers assigned a value to the former slaves. To investigate this, we transcribed 37,411 valuation records to compile a novel emancipation dataset. This gives us a new picture of the enslaved population in the Cape at the time of the emancipation. Some of our findings, for example that slaves from south-east Asia were assigned lower valuations than Cape-born slaves, are in contrast to those of an earlier literature. To distinguish between what the former slave-owners should have received and what they actually received, we matched the valuation records to the compensation claims. We argue that the uneven allocation of compensation had important implications for the distribution of capital after emancipation.;2021;When Cape slavery ended: Introducing a new slave emancipation dataset;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Escamilla-Guerrero, David; Kosack, Edward; Ward, Zachary";The first mass migration of Mexicans to the United States occurred in the early twentieth century: from smaller pre-Revolutionary flows in the 1900s, to hundreds of thousands during the violent 1910s, to the boom of the 1920s, and then the bust and deportations/repatriations of the 1930s. Using a new linked sample of males, we find that the average Mexican immigrant held a lower percentile rank, based on imputed earnings, than US-born whites near arrival. Further, Mexicans fell behind in the following decade. Mexican assimilation was not uniquely slow since we also find that the average Italian immigrant fell behind at a similar rate. Yet, conditional on geography, human capital, and initial percentile rank, Mexicans had a slower growth rate than both US-born whites and Italians. Mexican assimilation was also remarkably constant throughout various shocks, such as violence in Mexico, migration policy change in the United States, and the Great Depression. We argue that Mexican-specific structural barriers help to explain why Mexican progress was slow and similar across this tumultuous period.;2021;Life after crossing the border: Assimilation during the first Mexican mass migration;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Federico, Giovanni; Nuvolari, Alessandro; Ridolfi, Leonardo; Vasta, Michelangelo";In this paper, we estimate series of the skill premium for Italy during the early stages of the industrialization with a refined version of the regression approach originally introduced by Clark (J Polit Econ 113(6):1307–1340, 2005). We compute series for the whole country as well as separate series for macro-regions and for construction and manufacturing, and, within manufacturing, we estimate high and low skill premia for blue collars. We interpret the results with an extended version of the classic Katz and Autor (in: Ashenfelter, Card (eds) Handbook of labor economics, Elsevier, Dordrecht, pp 1463–1555, 1999) framework. The overall premium remained stable until the 1890s and then declined for the joint effect of migrations (almost exclusively of unskilled workers) and the rise in literacy, which was not compensated by the modest increase in industrial employment.;2021;The race between the snail and the tortoise: skill premium and early industrialization in Italy (1861–1913);Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Figueroa, Valentín;Rulers of modern states consolidated control over territories that were previously complicated mosaics of private political jurisdictions. Systematic information about this process is sparse. This article analyzes village-level transition paths between jurisdictions—royal, seigneurial, and ecclesiastical—in northern Castile in the period 1352–1787. It quantifies how much power different types of lords preserved or lost to the Crown in the long run and also offers conjectural estimates showing that exposure to opportunities for trade led to more resilient and larger royal domains—at the expense of secular lords, but not of the Catholic Church.;2021;The consolidation of royal control: evidence from northern Castile, 1352–1787;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Focusing on the early stage capital market in interwar Australia, we calculate the success (underpricing and percentage raised) of 786 new equity issues, comparing initial public offerings, seasoned equity offerings, and rights issues. We examine whether the use of underwriters and the choice of security (ordinary or preference shares) affected the success of the equity issue. We find that certification by underwriters had no effect on capital-raising success once we controlled for firm-specific factors in the multivariate regressions, while underpricing and percentage raised varied by type of shares offered to investors.;2021;Underpricing in a developing capital market: Australian equity issuances, 1920–39†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Fochesato, Mattia;After the 1348 Black Death, the Republic of Siena went through a period of recurrent plagues, military threats, and famines. During this phase the city moved from the oligarchic system to a coalition formed by the participation of social groups previously excluded from politics, an institutional path almost unique among contemporary Italian states. Did the city maintain its fiscal capacity, and, if so, how? These questions are addressed using a quantitative analysis of a new dataset compiled from the fiscal archives of the city of Siena, which shows two main results. First, despite the increasing external threats, the coalitions were able to maintain fiscal capacity until the second half of the fifteenth century. Second, they did so by adopting progressive fiscal instruments that allowed the city to raise the resources needed to deal with increasing fiscal pressure. However, these instruments ultimately linked the fiscal capacity of Siena to the economic trends of northern and central Italy. When in the second half of the fifteenth century the region entered into an economic downturn, the fiscal capacity of Siena plummeted and the city lost its independence.;2021;Plagues, wars, political change, and fiscal capacity: late medieval and Renaissance Siena, 1337–1556†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Fukao, Kyoji; Paul, Saumik";This article examines the drivers of the long-run structural transformation in Japan. It uses a dynamic input?output framework that decomposes the reallocation of the total output across sectors into two components: the demand side and the supply side, or technological change. To perform this task, we employ 13 seven-sector input?output tables spanning 100 years (1885 to 1985). The results show that the demand-side factors, as a combination of the Baumol and Engel effects, were the key explanatory factors in more than 60 per cent of the sector-period cases in the pre-Second World War period, while the supply-side effect drove structural transformation in more than 75 per cent of such cases in the post-Second World War period. Detailed decomposition results suggest that in most of the sectors, changes in private consumption were the dominant force behind the demand-side explanations. The demand effect was found to be strongest in the commerce and services sector, which contributed to the rapid growth of GDP in Japan throughout the twentieth century.;2021;Baumol, Engel, and beyond: accounting for a century of structural transformation in Japan, 1885–1985†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

We take a multi-dimensional perspective and apply an indicator that combines four key dimensions of well-being: material living standards, health, working time, and inequality. Contrary to other composite measures of well-being, our welfare metric draws on standard economic theory to aggregate its underlying components. We find decreasing welfare during the late eighteenth century due to rising working time and income inequality, despite improving health. After 1800, workers’ conditions improved when real wages started to rise, although the cumulative effect was not substantial by 1850.;2021;Optimism or pessimism?

"Galli, Stefania; Rönnbäck, Klas";Land distribution is considered to be one of the main contributors to inequality in pre-industrial societies. This article contributes to the debate on the origins of economic inequality in pre-industrial African societies by studying land inequality at a particularly early stage of African economic history. The research examines land distribution and inequality in land ownership among settlers in the Colony of Sierra Leone for three benchmark years over the first 40 years of its existence. The findings show that land inequality was low at the founding of the Colony but increased substantially over time. We suggest that this increase was enabled by a shift in the type of egalitarianism pursued by the colonial authorities, which was reflected in a change in the redistributive policy applied, which allowed later settlers to appropriate land more freely than had been previously possible.;2021;Land distribution and inequality in a black settler colony: the case of Sierra Leone, 1792–1831†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"García-Zúñiga, Mario; López Losa, Ernesto";Using a database of about 375,000 individual observations, which represent over two million days worked, this article studies building workers? remunerations and how labour markets functioned in eighteenth-century Madrid. We present new wage series that correct and improve the evidence existing in the literature and provide an explanation for the long-run wage stickiness found in the city. Economic factors, rather than customs or guild regulations, explain why wage rates remained unaltered for about 100 years. The reconstruction of the working lives of 100 of the workers who took part in the construction of the Royal Palace of Madrid provides the first evidence of wage profiles for pre-industrial times. They demonstrate that every wage rate was attached to a certain level of skill. Craftsmen's wages increased as they gained abilities, as human capital theory predicts, while returns to age or experience were negligible in the case of unskilled workers. This points to the existence of segmented labour markets in the building sector in early modern Spain.;2021;Skills and human capital in eighteenth-century Spain: wages and working lives in the construction of the Royal Palace of Madrid (1737–1805)†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
GARRIDO, SAMUEL;"As it is usually believed that cooperatives made a great contribution to the modernisation of agriculture and when they began to spread agriculture still had a great weight in European economies, it is of interest to know why agricultural cooperatives had uneven success, both from one crop to another and between and within countries. In this article, I focus on the intriguing case of wine, a product of great importance to Mediterranean Europe. After defending that, in actual fact, wine cooperatives were generally unable to offer members important economic advantages; I argue that they only flourished where some ‘local’ factor increased the attraction of belonging to them and, in addition, it was possible to finance their construction. I use what happened in France as a reference and show that in Spain both circumstances only converged in (a part of) Catalonia, as a paradoxical result of inequality and the social conflicts caused by a sharecropping contract called rabassa morta.";2021;Inequality and conflict as drivers of cooperation: the location of wine cooperatives in pre-1936 Spain;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Geloso, Vincent; Pavlik, Jamie Bologna";The Cuban government often boasts that the country’s infant mortality rate has been low and falling since Fidel Castro’s revolution in 1959. However, because many Latin American countries have experienced similar decreases, and because Cuba historically enjoyed lower infant mortality rates than the rest of Latin America, it is unclear whether the government should get credit. We use the fact that Cuba underwent momentous and unique political changes to consider the effect of Castro’s regime on infant mortality. We employ a synthetic control method to ascertain how much of the reduction, if any, can be attributed to the regime. We find that in the first decade of the regime, infant mortality increased relative to the counterfactual, but that—after the introduction of Soviet subsidies—infant mortality partially reverted to trend. To measure the effect of the subsidies, we run a second synthetic control test concerning the collapse of the Soviet Union and the accompanying end of the subsidies. This control suggests that the subsidies played no important role.;2021;The Cuban revolution and infant mortality: A synthetic control approach;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Grajzl, Peter; Murrell, Peter";A characterization of the ideas of Francis Bacon and Edward Coke, two preeminent English lawyer-scholars, provides insights into the nature of the legal–intellectual culture of early seventeenth-century England. This emerging culture remains underexplored, even though it immediately preceded and provided essential input into the ‘culture of growth,' the eighteenth-century cultural paradigm viewed as a catalyst for England's historically unprecedented technological advance and economic growth. To develop insights, we employ a methodology not previously used in this context, applying structural topic modeling to a large corpus comprising the works of both Bacon and Coke. Estimated topics span legal, political, scientific, and methodological themes. Legal topics evidence an advanced structure of common-law thought, straddling ostensibly disparate areas of the law. Interconnections between topics reveal a distinctive approach to the pursuit of knowledge, embodying Bacon's epistemology and Coke's legal methodology. A key similarity between Bacon and Coke overshadows their differences: both sought to build reliable knowledge based on generalizing from particulars. The resulting methodological paradigm can be understood as reflecting a legacy of common-law thought and constituting a key contribution to the era's emerging legal–intellectual culture. More generally, our analysis illustrates how machine learning applied to primary texts can aid in exploration of culture.;2021;Characterizing a legal–intellectual culture: Bacon, Coke, and seventeenth-century England;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Grodecka-Messi, Anna; Kenny, Seán; Ögren, Anders";This paper studies the Swedish experience of the international crisis of 1907, which is often compared with the crisis of 2008. By constructing a new dataset from previously unanalyzed monthly bank-level data, we document high-frequency changes in bank outcomes throughout the 1907 crisis. While distressed banks suffered substantial withdrawals of foreign funds and liquid domestic liabilities, we show that banks’ asset structures, along with observable fundamentals and institutional characteristics, played a more significant role in their subsequent fate. Higher shares of non-performing assets and lending against equities were the most important balance sheet predictors of distress. These balance sheet fundamentals, as well as over-extended branch networks, significantly shortened the lifespan of Swedish banks in the aftermath of the 1907 crisis.;2021;Predictors of bank distress: The 1907 crisis in Sweden;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Henriques, Sofia Teives; Sharp, Paul Richard";We provide a natural resource explanation for the divergence of the Portuguese economy relative to other European countries before the Second World War. First, we demonstrate that a lack of domestic resources meant that Portugal experienced limited and unbalanced growth during the age of steam. Imports of coal were prohibitively expensive for inland areas. Coastal areas industrialized through steam but were constrained by limited demand from the interior. Second, we show that after the First World War, when other coal-poor countries turned to hydro-power, Portugal relied on coal-based thermal-power, creating a vicious circle of high-energy prices and labor-intensive industrialization.;2021;Without coal in the age of steam and dams in the age of electricity: an explanation for the failure of Portugal to industrialize before the Second World War;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Higgins, David M.; Varian, Brian D.";Before 1932, Britain’s essentially free-trade policy left barely any scope for reciprocating the preferential tariffs that the Dominions applied to Britain’s exports. Thus, Britain attempted to reciprocate by means of a “soft” trade policy aimed at increasing Britain’s imports from the empire through wide-reaching publicity coordinated by the Empire Marketing Board (EMB). This article, the first econometric assessment of the EMB, argues that there was not a differential increase in the volume of those imports advertised by the EMB. Principal arguments for this failure are that British consumers were frequently unaware of the geographic origin of many commodities and that they tended to identify company brand more than country of origin.;2021;Britain’s Empire Marketing Board and the failure of soft trade policy, 1926–33;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Karlsson, Lars; Hedberg, Peter";This article examines the impact of war on trade between 1830 and 1913, that is, during the so-called first wave of globalization. It has been argued that one of the main reasons for the rapid integration of commodity and factor markets that took place during this period was the peaceful character of the post-Napoleonic nineteenth century. However, little research has been conducted on the actual impact of wars on international trade during this period. Previous research on the link between war and trade in general has found that war reduces trade both between belligerents and between belligerents and third parties (or neutrals). Apart from a handful of country case studies, this research has focused almost exclusively on the period before or after the peaceful nineteenth century. Our results show that, in the nineteenth century, the negative influence of war on trade was mainly limited to the belligerent economies, while belligerent?neutral trade was either unaffected or even increased during times of war. Also, in contrast to the findings of research on twentieth-century wars, we find that nineteenth-century wars had a strictly contemporaneous impact on trade, with a return to normalcy ensuing shortly after the cessation of hostilities.;2021;War and trade in the peaceful century: the impact of interstate wars on bilateral trade flows during the first wave of globalization, 1830–1913†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Keywood, Thomas; Baten, Jörg";Our research expands earlier studies on elite human capital by widening the geographic scope and tracing the early roots of the European divergence. We present new evidence of elite numeracy in Europe since the sixth century CE. During the early medieval period, Western Europe had no advantage over the east, but the development of relative violence levels changed this. After implementing an instrumental variable strategy and a battery of robustness tests, we find a substantial relationship between elite numeracy and elite violence, and conclude that violence had a detrimental impact on human capital formation. For example, the disparities in violence between Eastern and Western Europe helped to shape the famous divergence movement via this elite numeracy mechanism and had substantial implications for the economic fortunes of each region over the following centuries.;2021;Elite violence and elite numeracy in Europe from 500 to 1900 CE: roots of the divergence;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Kopczyński, Michał; Rodak, Mateusz";The article aims to assess the importance of the timing of exposure to nutritional stress for adult stature. We test the hypothesis that exposure in adolescence (12 to 20 years of age) may have a more detrimental effect than exposure in infancy. To substantiate this, we analyse a sample of male prison inmates incarcerated in central Poland in the interwar period. We find that the secular trend in stature that had started in Poland in the 1860s was reversed in cohorts born between 1896 and 1904, who were exposed to nutritional stress during the First World War between the ages of 12 and 25 years. In comparison, wartime infants and toddlers did much better. In the improving economic conditions of the 1920s, they were able to undo the scars of war during their adolescence. The conclusion is corroborated by data concerning soldiers and conscripts to the Polish army. With regard to body mass index (BMI), we found that the trends among convicts and conscripts differ. This is caused by changes in the composition of the prison sample, related to the impact of the Great Depression. In summary, it seems that stature is a more robust proxy of well-being than BMI.;2021;The Polish interbella puzzle: the biological standard of living in the Second Polish Republic, 1918–39 †;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Lantz, Gunnar;The mixed economy of the twentieth century shows conflicting developments in tax collection. Progressive taxes to limit top incomes are not the whole story.

Previous studies conclude that tax progressivity peaked in the 1980s. This study shows instead how Swedish taxation became regressive in that period. The literature on welfare regimes and redistributive universalism relies empirically on conditions in the 1980s.

Altogether, this paper aims not only to present the determinants of the industrial map of Spain, but also to highlight the positive externalities that stem from the interaction between the NEG and economic history, showing the usefulness of a cliometric approach based on economic theory and empirical testing to give us a more detailed knowledge of the past.;2021;New economic geography and economic history: a survey of recent contributions through the lens of the Spanish industrialization process;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Catalonia was not just the leading industrial region in Spain but also where cooperatives first emerged and had a greater presence. In line with the existing evidence, we find that cooperativism spread from coastal municipalities to the hinterland. In particular, it seems that local conditions (literacy and social capital) facilitated this process, while accessibility to the transport network and neighbouring effects also played a significant role.;2021;Old wine in new wineskins?

Montalbo, Adrien;The French Revolution substantially impacted primary schools as it suppressed one of their major funding sources, taxes collected by the clergy. Nonetheless, the geographical distribution of schools and enrollment rates remained relatively stable until late into the nineteenth century. In this article, I show that understanding the reorganization of primary schooling after the Revolution is essential in accounting for these long-lasting variations. By using data at the level of schools and an IV strategy relying on the trade cost shock caused by the Napoleonic blockade, I first show that municipalities took over the control of instruction in richer and growing areas. Secondly, I demonstrate that, by subsidizing schools, municipal authorities contributed to lower schooling fees and to increase enrollment. Finally, I show that human capital accumulation was higher in the schools provided with public grants, which influenced positively the subsequent development of municipalities. Public investment in education is therefore a key determinant of knowledge accumulation in nineteenth-century France.;2021;Schools without a law: Primary education in France from the Revolution to the Guizot Law;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Morys, Matthias;"We add a historical and regional dimension to the debate on the Greek debt crisis by analysing repeated cycles of entry and exit from the gold standard, government default, and financial supervision for four South-East European countries from political independence to World War II. The prevailing pattern of fiscal dominance was broken only under financial supervision, when conditionality scaled back the treasury’s influence; only then were central banks able to stabilize their exchange rates. A political economy analysis for Greece finds that financial supervision was politically acceptable as it made successfully adhering to gold more likely in the view of contemporaries.";2021;The gold standard, fiscal dominance and financial supervision in Greece and South-East Europe, 1841–1939;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Naef, Alain;The effectiveness of central bank intervention is debated and despite literature showing mixed results, central banks regularly intervene in the foreign exchange market, both in developing and developed economies. Does foreign exchange intervention work? Using over 60,000 new daily observations on intervention and exchange rates, this paper is the first to study the Bank of England's foreign exchange intervention between 1952 and 1972. The main finding is that the Bank was unsuccessful in managing a credible exchange rate over that period. Running an event study, I demonstrate that betting systematically against the Bank of England would have been a profitable trading strategy. Pressures increased in the 1960s and the Bank eventually manipulated the publication of its reserve figures to avoid a run on sterling.;2021;Dirty float or clean intervention?

"Natkhov, Timur; Vasilenok, Natalia";This paper examines knowledge spillovers across ethnic boundaries. Using the case of skilled German immigrants in the Russian Empire, we study technology adoption among Russian peasants. We find that distance to German settlements predicts the prevalence of heavy iron ploughs, fanning mills and wheat sowing among Russians, who traditionally ploughed with a light wooden ard and sowed rye. The main channel of technology adoption was German fairs. We show that heavy ploughs increased the labor productivity of Russian peasants. However, communication barriers precluded Russians from adopting skill-intensive occupations like blacksmithing, mechanics, carpentry, and other crafts. The results suggest that skilled immigrants may enhance local development through the introduction of advanced tools without transmitting their skills to a receiving society.;2021;Skilled immigrants and technology adoption: Evidence from the German settlements in the Russian empire;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Nicolini, Esteban A.; Ramos Palencia, Fernando";Most research on inequality in pre-industrial economies has focused on either wealth or income, generating not readily comparable results. In this paper, we use a unique data set of Spain circa 1750 including information on (among other things) wealth and income for the same sample of households. Our findings provide methodological insights showing that a household’s position in the income distribution is strongly correlated with its position in the wealth distribution but is also influenced by several other household specific characteristics like human capital of the head of the household and the economic sector of her/his main occupation.;2021;Comparing income and wealth inequality in pre-industrial economies: the case of Castile (Spain) in the eighteenth century;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Norkus, Zenonas; Markevičiūtė, Jurgita";Using the demand-side approach we provide new estimates of output per capita for Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania in 1913, 1922, 1929, and 1938. Our findings suggest that the levels of real output per capita in Estonia and Latvia were much above the all-Russian mean in 1913. In 1938, the output per capita of Estonia and Latvia surpassed the prewar level by up to 20%, but the total output of Latvia did not reach this mark because of population reduction. Structural changes in the interwar Estonian and Latvian economies explain long postwar recovery and modest growth beyond the prewar levels. In 1892–1914, there was export-oriented industrialization of Latvia, resembling the development of Eastern Asian “tigers” in the late twentieth century. By 1914, mainland Latvia was an “entrepôt industrial economy,” created mainly by the foreign direct investments of Western companies that established their subsidiaries there beyond the Russian protective customs wall. After the loss of the Russian market, Latvia and Estonia partially deindustrialized and reagrarized, while the interwar independence period was too short for policies of “Denmarkization” to bring about strong catching-up growth. Therefore, their standing in the international ranking according to output per capita did not improve over the 1913–1938 period. Lithuanian output per capita stagnated until 1929 because of infraction of its economic integrity by the loss of the Vilnius area and difficulties of economic integration of the formerly German Klaipėda (Memel) region, but did grow rapidly in 1930s up to 40% of 1913 level by 1938.;2021;New estimation of the gross domestic product in Baltic countries in 1913–1938;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Nuvolari, Alessandro; Tartari, Valentina; Tranchero, Matteo";The distinction between macro- and microinventions is at the core of recent debates on the Industrial Revolution. Yet, the empirical testing of this notion has remained elusive. We address this issue by introducing a new quality indicator for all patents granted in England in the period 1700–1850. The indicator provides the opportunity for a large-scale empirical appraisal of macro- and microinventions. Our findings indicate that macroinventions did not exhibit any specific time-clustering, while microinventions were characterized by clustering behavior. In addition, we also find that macroinventions displayed a labor-saving bias and were mostly introduced by professional engineers. These results suggest that Allen’s and Mokyr’s views of macroinventions, rather than conflicting, should be regarded as complementary.;2021;Patterns of innovation during the Industrial Revolution: A reappraisal using a composite indicator of patent quality;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
OKAZAKI, TETSUJI;This article contributes to the ?factory debate? by disentangling the effects of technological change and organizational change during the rise of the factory, using unique data from the weaving industry in early twentieth-century Japan. During this period, a variety of production organizations co-existed, as did a variety of technologies, which creates an excellent opportunity to evaluate the implications of the factory system. Using regression analyses and observation of descriptive data, this study finds that production value per worker was around two times larger in factories compared with weavers and outworkers under the putting-out system, after controlling for the technological difference. This difference is supposed to reflect the difference in the mode of work?that is, working hours and work intensity?between factories and weavers and outworkers. Meanwhile, production per worker was two to three times larger for powered factories than non-powered factories, other things being equal. Thus, the magnitude of the impact of organizational difference was almost comparable to that of technological difference.;2021;Disentangling the effects of technological and organizational changes during the rise of the factory: the case of the Japanese weaving industry, 1905−14†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Pablo-Martí, Federico; Alañón-Pardo, Ángel; Sánchez, Angel";The work aims to study, using GIS techniques and network analysis, the development of the road network in Spain during the period between the War of Succession and the introduction of the railway (1700-1850). Our research is based on a detailed cartographic review of maps made during the War of Succession, largely improving preexisting studies based on books of itineraries from the sixteenth century onwards. We build a new, complete map of the main roads at the beginning of the eighteenth century along with the matrix of transport costs for all the important towns describing the communications network. Our study of this complex network, supplemented by a counterfactual analysis carried out using a simulation model based on agents using different centralized decision-making processes, allows us to establish three main results. First, existing trade flows at the beginning of the eighteenth century had a radial structure, so the Bourbon infrastructure plan only consolidated a preexisting situation. Second, the development of the network did not suppose important alterations in the comparative centrality of the regions. Finally, the design of the paved road network was adequate for the economic needs of the country. These findings are in stark contrast with claims that the radial structure of the Bourbon roads was designed ex-novo with political or ideological objectives rather than economic ones. Our methodology paves the way to further studies of path-dependent, long-term processes of network design as the key to understanding the true origin of many currently existing situations.;2021;Complex networks to understand the past: the case of roads in Bourbon Spain;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Pereira, Thales Zamberlan;Brazil's northern region supplied 40 per cent of the cotton imported into Liverpool during the last decade of the eighteenth century. In the following decades, however, cotton exports stagnated, and Brazil became the only major international cotton producer that decreased its exports to European countries. This article shows that the fiscal policies of Brazil's central government had a significant role on the decline of cotton exports. The central government set export taxes to maximize revenue from higher-quality long-staple cotton, decreasing the profitability of short staples, which saw the largest increase in demand during the nineteenth century.;2021;Taxation and the stagnation of cotton exports in Brazil, 1800–60†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Petralia, Sergio;The pervasive diffusion of electricity-related technologies at the beginning of the twentieth century has been studied extensively to understand the transformative potential of general purpose technologies (GPTs). Most of what we know, however, has been investigated in relation to the diffusion of their use. This article provides evidence on the county-level economic impact of the technological adoption of electrical and electronic (E&E) technologies in the 1920s in the United States (US). It focuses on measuring the impact of a GPT on technological adopters, i.e., those who are able to develop, transform, and complement it. It is shown that places with patenting activity in E&E technologies grew faster and paid higher wages than others between 1920 and 1930. This analysis required constructing a novel database identifying detailed geographical information for historical patent documents in the US since 1836, as well as developing a text-mining algorithm to identify E&E patents based on patent descriptions.;2021;GPTs and growth: evidence on the technological adoption of electrical and electronic technologies in the 1920s;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"POSTIGLIOLA, M.; Rota, Mauro";The provincial gap in human capital at the time of Italy’s unification is a plausible explanation for the North–South divide of the following decades. We show that the roots of the literacy gap that existed in 1861 can be traced back to Napoleonic educational reforms enacted between 1801 and 1814. We use exogenous variation in provincial distance to Paris to quantify effects, linking the duration of Napoleonic control to human capital. If the south had experienced the same Napoleonic impact as the north, southern literacy rates would have been up to 70 percent higher than they were in 1861.;2021;Institutions and literacy rates: the legacy of Napoleonic reforms in Italy;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Prados De La Escosura, Leandro;A long-run view of well-being over the last one-and-a-half centuries is presented using an Augmented Human Development Index (AHDI) that combines achievements in health, education, material living standards, and political freedom. The AHDI shows substantial gains in world human development since 1870, although significant room for improvement still remains. The AHDI spread unevenly until 1960, in absolute terms, and up to 1929 in relative ones, and reversed this trend thereafter. The main relative gain went to world countries? middle class, but the main absolute gain accrued to the top decile. AHD trends and distribution do not match, but compare favourably with, those in per capita income. The absolute gap between present-day advanced countries and the rest of the world deepened over time, though fell in relative terms. Life expectancy has led progress in AHD, particularly until 1970, and drove the catching-up by the rest of the world during the epidemiological transition. Political and civil liberties took over thereafter.;2021;Augmented human development in the age of globalization†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Price, Gregory; Whatley, Warren";In 1711, British Parliament chartered the South Sea Company, a public–private corporation chartered to reduce the cost of government borrowing by swapping illiquid short-term government debt for tradeable shares of the South Sea Co. To attract subscribers, the government also awarded the South Sea Co. an international monopoly in the trade of African slaves to Spanish America—the Asiento de Negros. This paper considers the extent to which Asiento-related slave trading was profitable for South Sea Co. shareholders and beneficial to the British financial revolution between 1713 and 1743. First, we use historical financial data to estimate the parameters of a capital asset pricing model of excess returns for South Sea Co. shareholders. We find that the Asiento contract increased risk-adjusted excess returns on South Sea Co. stock between 18 and 24% per year. Second, we estimate profit margins in the South Sea Co. Asiento slave trade. These show a stark positive correlation with company share prices before and after the South Sea Bubble of 1720. Adding slave ship departures to the CAPM specifications confirms the direct contribution of slave trading to shareholder returns. We also find that the Asiento and Asiento-related slave trading increased central government fiscal surplus by 16%. This suggests that profitable slave trading by the South Sea Co. under the Asiento enhanced Great Britian’s fiscal capacity, which could be utilized to enhance a military capacity necessary for securing an empire.;2021;Did profitable slave trading enable the expansion of empire?: The Asiento de Negros, the South Sea Company and the financial revolution in Great Britain;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Price, Joseph; Buckles, Kasey; van Leeuwen, Jacob; Riley, Isaac";A key challenge for research on many questions in the social sciences is that it is difficult to link records in a way that allows investigators to observe people at different points in their life or across generations. In this paper, we contribute to recent efforts to create these links with a new approach that relies on millions of record links created by individual contributors to a large, public, wiki-style family tree. We use these “true” links both to inform the decisions one needs to make when using automated methods to link records and as a training data set for use in a supervised machine learning approach. We describe our procedure and illustrate its potential by linking individuals across the 100% samples of the US censuses from 1900, 1910, and 1920. When linking adjacent censuses, we obtain an overall match rate of 62-65 percent (for over 88.9 million matches), with a false positive rate that is around 6-7 percent and with links that are similar to the population along observable characteristics. Thus, our method allows us to link records with a combination of a high match rate, precision, and representativeness that is beyond the current frontier. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of the data by estimating the degree of intergenerational transmission of literacy between father-son and mother-daughter pairs.;2021;Combining family history and machine learning to link historical records: The Census Tree data set;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Rose, Jonathan D.;Short-term contracts were a staple of the American residential mortgage market until the Great Depression, after which policymakers pushed for longer terms in order to eliminate refinancing risk. Using a first-of-its-kind data set on mortgages outstanding in 1930, this paper suggests that short-term contracts had remained popular until the Depression because of their appeal to a class of well-off sophisticated borrowers who were undeterred by refinancing risk, and who valued flexible amortization. In contrast, typical wage earners preferred longer terms in order to eliminate refinancing risk, even as they took on the burden of regular amortization payments.;2021;Short-term residential mortgage contracts in American economic history;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Rota, Mauro; Weisdorf, Jacob L.";This article presents an early modern wage index for stable rural male workers in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. These wages highlight the importance of distinguishing between locations and contract types when considering historical workers? living standards, and they speak to a longstanding debate about whether Italy's early modern downturn was purely an urban phenomenon, or an all-embracing one. Our data lend support to the former view, since we do not detect any downturn in our early modern rural wages. This observation informs the little divergence debate. By comparing rural rather than urban wages and stable rather than casual ones, we find that annual English earnings rose from being only 10 per cent higher than those in Italy in 1650 to being a staggering 150 per cent higher in 1800. If wages reflected labour productivity, then unskilled English workers?unlike their Italian counterparts?grew increasingly productive in the run-up to the industrial revolution.;2021;Italy and the little divergence in wages and prices: evidence from stable employment in rural areas†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Santiago Caballero, Carlos;Using an original microeconomic database with information for around 200,000 individuals, this paper creates new estimates of internal migrations in Spain in a key moment of its economic history. Our analysis shows that internal migrations were not a linear process including both periods of stagnation and also rapid growth, and that the 1850s were a decade of surprising high mobility in the absence of modern transportation. We also conclude that the rise in mobility was geographically asymmetrical with traditional urban centres losing ground against the rise of Madrid and Barcelona. The modernisation of the country also had significant social impacts with the migratory gender gap being significantly reduced prior to 1870. An analysis of the determinants of internal migrations suggests that traditional push and pull factors described by the literature in the early twentieth century seem to be also behind the early migrations of the mid-nineteenth century. The modernisation of the country provided new opportunities in urban areas that, combined with falling transport and information costs, created the perfect conditions for the ‘democratisation’ of long-distance migrations.;2021;Domestic migrations in Spain during its first industrialisation, 1840s–1870s;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Schisani, Maria Carmela; Balletta, Luigi; Ragozini, Giancarlo";In this article, we study the effect of the Unification on the network power of economic elites in the South of Italy. We study the persistence of economic elites as evidence of the stability of the institutional set up beyond the effect of Unification, and thus as a primary explaining factor of the persistence of social forces slowing and opposing modernization. We use original archival data on the universe of Naples enterprises to build the networks of business relations between individual economic actors for the 20-year period immediately before and after Unification. The persistence of network power and its determinants is tested via a difference-in-difference model. The main finding is that economic elites persist over Unification. The long-term business relations, rooted in the Bourbon period, the persisting lobbying power of the financial industry, the close collusive ties with potential foreign competitors and the closeness to politics after 1861 are all elements that explain how the Southern economic elites were able to crowd-out the change.;2021;Crowding out the change: business networks and persisting economic elites in the South of Italy over Unification (1840–1880);Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Schøyen, Øivind;We model a game between an authority, seeking to implement its state identity, and a parental generation, seeking to socialize a younger generation into their own identity. The authority first selects a coercion level against the non-state identity. The parental generation then chooses whether to insurrect in response to the coercion level and, if not, decides how much to invest in socializing their children into the non-state identity. In this overlapping generations model, we formalize and explore the consequences of an intrinsic negative reaction to coercion: coercion resentment. We show how coercion resentment can create an interval where coercion has negative efficacy in imposing the state identity. This causes the rational legitimacy maximizing authority to restrain its use of coercion. We then show how this inefficacy of coercion can make certain levels of coercion unimplementable without causing the non-state identity to insurrect. This causes the long-run equilibrium size of the non-state identity group to be dependent on their initial size and, thus, path dependence. We consider the validity of the model by reviewing two historical episodes: Stalin’s secularization project (1922–1953) and the Counter-Reformation in early modern France and the Holy Roman Empire (1517–1685).;2021;What limits the efficacy of coercion?;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Davenport's claims that mortality patterns c. 1830?70 were driven by a synchronized rise and fall of scarlet fever across Europe and North America, as well as in rural locations in Britain, are based on frail and inconclusive forms of evidence.

Timini, Jacopo;"Between its unification and WWI, Italy’s changing export composition echoed its economic transformation. In this paper, I decompose Italian export growth in its margins and then analyze the determinants of Italian exports and product market entry (and exit). To do so, I use two different databases (aggregate and product-level bilateral trade data) and methodologies (gravity and logit models). Besides confirming some well-known empirical and historical facts for the Italian case (gravity variables hold; trade follows a Heckscher–Olhin pattern), the regression results offer a new perspective on two distinctive features of its history: trade policy and emigration. These two factors are positively associated with Italian exports and product market entry. These findings also have additional implications for the role of emigration on the course of the Italian economy: accounting for the trade channel, its overall effect may be larger than previously thought.";2021;The drivers of Italian exports and product market entry: 1862–1913;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Troesken, Werner; Tynan, Nicola; Yang, Yuanxiaoyue Artemis";What are the benefits of moving from intermittent water delivery (which limits user access to less than 24 h per day) to constant service? To address this question, we study the transition from intermittent to constant water supply in London. Between 1871 and 1910, the proportion of London households with access to a constant water supply (24 h a day, 7 days a week) rose from less than 20–100 percent. Idiosyncratic delays in the negotiation process between companies and property owners generated random variation in the timing of the transition across London districts. Exploiting this variation, we find that a one percentage point increase in a local population with access to constant service decreased deaths from waterborne diseases by as much as 0.4 percent and explains approximately a fifth of the late nineteenth century decline in waterborne disease mortality. Results are robust to the inclusion of controls for population density, concerns regarding the reporting of cause-of-death, district-specific time trends, district demographics and spatial autocorrelation.;2021;What are the health benefits of a constant water supply?

Yoon, Yeo Joon;I construct a general equilibrium model with economies of scale and learning-by-doing in manufacturing to quantify the effects of tariff that the US imposed on its manufacturing imports from 1870 to 1913. I find that the tariff positively contributes to US manufacturing growth, but the magnitudes are small. I also show that the cumulative welfare effect of the tariff is positive if there exists enough degree of learning-by-doing, a result contrary to the conventional wisdom that tariffs have welfare-deteriorating effects. The welfare-enhancing effect of the tariff disappears when I use a similarly constructed model, but with constant returns to scale in manufacturing. The result suggests that the assumption about technology is important for the welfare implication of the tariff.;2021;Tariffs and industrialization in late nineteenth century America: the role of scale economies;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
ZAHEDIEH, NUALA;Eric Williams placed the Caribbean centre stage in discussions of Britain's industrial revolution and historians are increasingly persuaded by his intuition that the Atlantic trading system, underpinned by enslaved labour, played a major role. Early critics focused discussion on the profits of the slave trade but his thesis was broader, and more sophisticated, than they acknowledged. It left room for linkages of many kinds and it is now time to take a broader look at the connections between the rise of merchant capitalism, in which slavery played a central role, and British economic growth. This study looks at one small, fast-growing industry, wrought copper, largely through the lens of William Forbes, a London smith. Quantitative data from output and trade records are combined with Forbes's business records to show how the demands of sugar cultivation, a particularly concentrated form of agro-industrial activity, stimulated the development of a supply network which chained thousands of workers in Cornwall, South Wales, Bristol, and London to enslaved labour in the fields and factories of the Caribbean. Market opportunities allowed Forbes to amass great wealth but also directed investment, innovation, and the accumulation of skills that shaped Britain's particular path to industrial revolution.;2021;Eric Williams and William Forbes: copper, colonial markets, and commercial capitalism†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Zendejas, Juan Flores;This article analyses the defaults of the League loans, which were private loans promoted by the League of Nations to support governments in central and eastern Europe in the 1920s. Previous works have argued that governments refused to grant these loans preferred status. However, this article shows that at the onset of the crisis, investors and governments treated these loans differently. It provides an empirical analysis to test whether there was a common element in the pricing of these loans and whether they enjoyed seniority compared to other, non-League loans. The findings show that there was a common factor driving the bond prices of these loans at the onset of the 1931 banking crisis. This article demonstrates that while these loans were not legally senior, certain governments granted the League loans de facto preferred status under the assumption that averting default would foster renewed support from the League. Archival evidence is provided to show that governments ceased to grant the League loans exceptional treatment when the expected support from the League did not materialize, which further weakened the ability of the League to secure emergency lending.;2021;Contesting the preferred creditor status of the League of Nations, 1931–3†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

We test this hypothesis by considering the relationship between franchise extension and selected aspects of fiscal structure at both central and local government levels in the UK from 1820 to 1913. We do so without imposing a priori restrictions on the direction of causality using a novel method for causal investigation of non-experimental data proposed by Hoover (2001). This method is based on tests for structural breaks in the conditional and marginal distributions of the franchise and fiscal structure time series preceded by a detailed historical narrative analysis.

To account for high thresholds of fiscal exemption, a new method is introduced to reconstruct complete distributions from left-censored observations. First, we analyse inequality at the county level, finding an impressive stability across time in the relative position of the English counties, perturbed only by the tendency of the South and South-East to become relatively more inegalitarian. Then, we produce an aggregate distribution representative of England as a whole, and we detect an overall tendency for inequality to grow from medieval to early modern times due largely to North?South divergence in average household wealth. We discuss our results in the light of the recent literature on historical inequality.;2022;Wealth inequality in pre-industrial England: A long-term view (late thirteenth to sixteenth centuries);The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

We first document this collapse using newly digitized archaeological data. We then present a model of hydraulic society that highlights the collapse of state capacity as a proximate cause of the collapse of the economy and a shortened horizon of the ruler as a potential driver of the timing of the collapse. Using cross sections of tax collection data for 27 districts in southern Mesopotamia in 812, 846, and 918, we verify that the proximate cause of the crisis was the collapse in state capacity, which meant that the state no longer maintained the irrigation system. A particularly destructive succession struggle, shortening the investment horizon of rulers, determined the timing of the crisis.;2022;The Collapse of Civilization in Southern Mesopotamia;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Alvaredo, Facundo; Atkinson, A. B.";There have been important studies of recent income inequality and of poverty in South Africa, but very little is known about the long-run trends over time. There is speculation about the extent of inequality when the Union of South Africa was formed in 1910, but no hard evidence. In this paper, we provide evidence that is partial—being confined to top incomes—but which for the first time shows how the income distribution changed on a (near) annual basis from 1913 onwards. We present estimates of the shares in total income of groups such as the top 1% and the top 0.1%, covering the period from colonial times to the twenty-first century. For a number of years during the apartheid period, we have data classified by race. The estimates for recent years bear out the picture of South Africa as a highly unequal country, but allow this to be placed in historical and international context. The time series presented here will, we hope, provide the basis for detailed investigation of the impact of South African institutions and policies, past and present. But the similarity of the changes over time in top incomes across the four ex-dominions suggests that national developments have to be seen in the light of common global forces.;2022;Top incomes in South Africa in the twentieth century;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Andersson, Lars Fredrik; Eriksson, Liselotte; Nystedt, Paul";During the industrialization period, the rate of workplace-related accidents increased. Because of the lack of public insurance, mutual health insurance societies became the main providers of workplace accident insurance among workers. Due to large differences in accident risk, health insurance societies were potentially exposed to the risk of adverse selection, since they employed equal pricing for all members regardless of risk profile. This article investigates the impact of workplace accident risk on health insurance selection and outcomes. We employ household budget surveys encompassing urban workers in Sweden during the early twentieth century. We find evidence for a redistribution from low- to high-risk-exposed workers, as workplace accident risk had a significant and positive impact on receiving health insurance benefits, also when controlling for a variety of factors. Workers exposed to greater risks in the workplace were more likely to have health insurance but did not pay higher premiums. The redistribution from low- to high-risk-exposed workers was largely accepted and viewed as an act of solidarity between workers. Given that health insurance societies were aware of this redistribution, we argue for the presence of informed, rather than adverse, selection.;2022;Workplace accidents and workers’ solidarity: mutual health insurance in early twentieth-century Sweden†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Aslam, Maqsood; Farvaque, Etienne; Hayat, Muhammad Azmat";If historical shocks influence educational outcomes, how long does the effect last, and does it differ among ethnic groups? This study answers these questions by exploiting the historical experiment of partition—that is the splitting of the British Raj into India and Pakistan—and by presenting a theoretical model that explains the trade-offs such a shock uncovers for different ethnic groups that have to decide between assimilation through education and maintaining their ethnic specificity. We use different rounds of Pakistan social and living standard measurement (PSLM) survey and analyze the educational outcomes of the grandchildren of partition (i.e., whose grandparents were born during the partition). We show that the scar from partition is long-lasting, as the present generation is still living under its influence. More importantly, our results reveal the different adaptation strategies of ethnic and cultural groups in the long run.;2022;One partition, many divisions?

Azar, Paola;This paper examines the relationship between school provision and the political power of the president in Uruguay between 1914 and 1954. The empirical analysis relies on fixed effects panel estimations based on newly compiled information about the partisan orientation of legislative members, electoral competition and schooling diffusion at the department-level. Ceteris paribus, I find an association between school provision and the need of government to capture votes or to obtain further legislative support. The resource allocation initially benefitted government’s core voter departments and shifted to favor non-loyal districts as an answer to the increasing intra-party political conflicts. Against the traditional historical narrative, the results point out to an influence of political interests on the diffusion of mass schooling and suggest the use of school provision as a pork barrel good over the period.;2022;Politics as a determinant of primary school provision: the case of Uruguay;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Baten, Jörg; Alexopoulou, Kleoniki";How can we trace early African development? The share of rulers’ known birth year has been identified as an indicator of elite numeracy in African regions since 1400, and the share of murdered rulers allows us to gain insights into interpersonal violence behaviour of African elites. From this emerges a dynamic picture of quantitative African history: the absence of elite violence and high elite numeracy developed jointly in sub-Saharan Africa. Some African regions, such as today’s Ethiopia and Angola, took the lead in early development but also experienced severe declines. Development in Africa was, on average, later than in Northwestern Europe.;2022;Elite violence and elite numeracy in Africa from 1400 CE to 1950 CE;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Battilossi, Stefano; Houpt, Stefan Oliver; Verdickt, Gertjan";The Spanish Second Republic was a unique experiment of democratization in interwar Europe, which was characterized by extreme levels of political uncertainty. We find that investors responded to shifts in uncertainty by selling stocks in favor of government bonds—a behavior known as flight-to-safety. Additionally, we find that political uncertainty caused stock market stress and induced significant differences in the cross-section of expected stock returns, consistent with the exposures to political uncertainty. The fact that investors recurrently scuttled to shelter into government bonds suggests that they did not perceive a radical change in the political regime as an immediate and credible threat.;2022;Scuttle for shelter: flight-to-safety and political uncertainty during the Spanish Second Republic;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Becker, Sascha O.; Mukand, Sharun; Yotzov, Ivan";Persecution, pogroms, and genocide have plagued humanity for centuries, costing millions of lives and haunting survivors. Economists and economic historians have recently made new contributions to the understanding of these phenomena. We provide a novel conceptual framework which highlights the inter-relationship between the intensity of persecution and migration patterns across dozens of historical episodes. Using this framework as a lens, we survey the growing literature on the causes and consequences of persecution, pogroms, and genocide. Finally, we discuss gaps in the literature and take several tentative steps towards explaining the differences in survival rates of European Jews in the 20th century.;2022;Persecution, pogroms and genocide: A conceptual framework and new evidence;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Becuwe, Stéphane; Blancheton, Bertrand; Maveyraud, Samuel";Using an original dataset and theoretical framework, this paper offers a reinterpretation of the French wine international trade after external shocks during wine globalisation based on trade policy. To maintain its external position, particularly after the arrival of phylloxera in the 1860s, French authorities promoted the development of Algerian vineyards by complex discrimination in tariffs. We highlight a negative relationship between discrimination in tariff policy and market share for wine trade partners to the detriment of Spain, Italy, and Portugal and in favour of Algeria. By combining a counterfactual analysis and two theoretical models, we consider Algeria as a new competitor in an imperfect competition. Moreover, using data of wine quality at a disaggregated level, we reveal that the control of imports by France allowed the diversification of the range of exports and maximisation of profits.;2022;New evidence on wine in French international trade (1848–1913): Import discrimination as export quality promotion;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Bengtsson, Erik; Olsson, Mats; Svensson, Patrick";This article describes and analyses social structure, poverty, wealth, and economic inequality in Stockholm from 1650 to 1750. We begin by establishing the social structure, using census data and other sources. To study wealth and poverty, the main sources are a complete record of the wealth tax of 1715, comprising 17,782 taxpayers, and a total of 1,125 probate inventories sampled from the years 1650, 1700, and 1750. These provide detailed and sometimes surprising insights into the living standards of both the poor and the rich. Stockholm in this period was a starkly unequal city, with the top decile of wealth holders owning about 90 per cent of total wealth. We relate this inequality to mercantilist policies. The city was run as an oligarchy and the oligarchical political institutions engendered policies that were rigged for inequality. The case of Stockholm thus shows the need for the historical inequality literature to consider class and power relations to understand the determinants of inequality.;2022;Mercantilist inequality: wealth and poverty in Stockholm, 1650–1750†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Beyer, Christian;In this article the effects of cartelization on firms’ efficiency are investigated using the example of an early twentieth century coal-mining cartel in Upper Silesia: the Upper Silesian Coal Convention. Established in 1898, the cartel comprised various types of private, as well as state-owned, mining enterprises. Using a microeconomic dataset based on firm-level data of the Upper Silesian mines, I focus on the cartel’s effect on efficiency. The cartel did not significantly reduce technical efficiency among mines. This finding confirms previous research on cartels’ effects on efficiency.;2022;Cartelization and firm performance in Upper Silesia 1880–1913;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Blum, Matthias; Krauss, Karl-Peter; Myeshkov, Dmytro";Prior to the ?Age of Mass Migration?, Germans left central Europe to settle primarily in modern-day Hungary, Serbia, Romania, Ukraine, and Russia. Despite the harsh conditions that the first generation of settlers had to endure, their descendants often fared better, rather than worse, compared to native population groups. This study offers a possible explanation for this surprising outcome. It makes use of data on approximately 11?500 individuals to estimate and compare the basic numeracy scores of German settlers and other population groups in target regions. The findings show that German settlers generally had superior basic numeracy levels, which suggests that these settlers must have contributed positively to the human capital endowment in their target regions. The numeracy of Germans was somewhat higher than the numeracy of Hungarians and substantially higher than that of Russians, Ukrainians, and Serbs. No noteworthy differences are found in terms of numeracy between German emigrants and the population they left behind, which suggests the absence of substantial migrant selection.;2022;Human capital transfer of German-speaking migrants in eastern Europe, 1780s–1820s;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

In this paper, using the asset portfolios of UK life assurers, we examine the role of regulation, historical contingency, and political reactions to events on the long-run development of the UK capital market. Government response to events such as war, hegemony-secured peace, and the wider macroeconomic environment was the ultimate determinant of major changes in asset allocation since 1800. Furthermore, when we compare the UK with the United States, we find that regulation played a limited role in shaping the asset portfolios of the UK life assurance industry.;2022;Capital market development over the long run: the portfolios of UK life assurers over two centuries;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Braggion, Fabio; Dwarkasing, Narly; Moore, Lyndon";The British banking sector had many small banks in the mid-nineteenth century. From around 1885 until the end of World War One there was a process of increasingly larger mergers between banks. By the end of the merger wave the English and Welsh market was highly concentrated, with only five major banks. News of a merger brought a persistent rise in the share prices of both the acquiring and the target bank (roughly 1% and 7%, respectively). Non-merging banks, especially those whose local market concentration rose because of the merger, saw their stock prices rise. Our findings suggest that the process of bank consolidation increased collusive behavior among merged banks, to the likely detriment of the consumer.;2022;Value creating mergers: British bank consolidation, 1885–1925;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

We study to what extent credit constraints contributed to the downturn by fitting a structural vector autoregressive model with data from January 1925 to September 1935. Adverse credit supply shocks contributed strongly to the downturn especially at the time of the 1931 banking crisis. Before that, credit supply shocks had also contributed to the expansion phase preceding the depression. We also find that aggregate demand and U.S. business cycle shocks were the primary drivers of the German Great Depression.;2022;Credit supply shocks and the Great Depression in Germany;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Broadberry, Stephen N.; Gardner, Leigh A.";Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has been absent from recent debates about comparative long-run growth owing to the lack of data on aggregate economic performance before 1950. This paper provides estimates of GDP per capita on an annual basis for eight Anglophone African economies for the period since 1885, raising new questions about previous characterizations of the region's economic performance. The new data show that many of these economies had levels of per capita income which were above subsistence by the early twentieth century, on a par with the largest economies in Asia until the 1980s. However, overall improvements in GDP per capita were limited by episodes of negative growth or “shrinking”, the scale and scope of which can be measured through annual data.;2022;Economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa, 1885–2008: Evidence from eight countries;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Brunt, Liam; Cannon, Edmund";Abstract Harnessing previously unused farm inventories and corn books, we provide data on wheat storage and sales by English farmers, 1750?1850. Wheat was predominantly stored outdoors in thatched stacks (or ?ricks?)?often for more than a year, sometimes for multiple years?although carryover volumes were generally small. Farm stocks tended to be threshed and sold evenly across the year to meet demand. Storage costs were low, and carried over wheat sold at a premium as the natural drying process raised its quality. Wheat was frequently sold directly to millers, bypassing the open market, but private sale prices tracked market prices closely.;2022;English farmers’ wheat storage and sales in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Sign restrictions derived from a workhorse Keynesian model are used to identify the signs of those shocks. We compare the 30 largest shocks implied by a vector autoregressive model in unemployment and inflation with the narrative historical record. Our approach provides a new perspective on well-known events in economic history. We highlight two episodes of particular interest: an aggregate supply shock in the late 1920s, which we attribute to changes in the bargaining power of labor, and positive aggregate demand shocks in the mid-1970s, which we attribute to fiscal policy.;2022;A history of aggregate demand and supply shocks for the United Kingdom, 1900 to 2016;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Going from regions with the lowest mortality to those with the highest mortality is associated to a decline in per capita GDP growth of 6.5%, which dissipated within 3 years.

Chuchko, Marina;Studies on the role of interest groups in the formation of public policy are generally focused on those in democratic countries. However, the emerging literature on interest groups in autocratic regimes suggests that business in such states is actively involved in policy formation. On the basis of the first dataset on the 1891 tariff reform in the Russian Empire, this study carries out an empirical examination of the role of business in policymaking in one of the most autocratic states in history. Dominance analysis is used to estimate the contribution of participants to tariff reform. The results show that while the state had an overriding influence on tariff formation, the contribution of business representatives is noteworthy. The addition of business associations to the model explaining tariff changes leads to an increase in the explained variance of the model by about seven percentage points. Additional regression analysis confirms that the success of lobbying depended on the homogeneity of the proposals presented by regional business associations.;2022;Business representation in an autocratic regime: Tariff policy and exchange committees in late Tsarist Russia;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

The City borrowed from its citizens and outside investors at rates much lower than previously thought to replace vital services and to support large improvement works. Lenders were reassured by the Corporation's reputation, and its borrowing was partly secured by future coal tax receipts. The records show that funding from these sources was forthcoming and would have covered the costs.

Cummins, Neil;Using individual-level records of all wealth-at-death in England from 1892 to 1992, together with new estimates of the wealth-specific rate of return on wealth, this study estimates a plausible minimum level of the amount of inherited wealth that is hidden. Elites conceal around 35 per cent of their inheritance. Among dynasties, this hidden wealth, independent of declared wealth, predicts appearance in the Offshore Leaks Database of 2013?16 and is correlated with postcode house-value in 1999 and Oxbridge attendance in 1990?2016. Accounting for hidden wealth eliminates about 28 per cent, at minimum, of the observed decline of the top 1 per cent wealth-share, at the dynastic level, over the past century.

"Cutsinger, Bryan P.; Geloso, Vincent; Bédard, Mathieu";We use the first French experiment with playing card money in its colony of Quebec between 1685 and 1719 to illustrate the link between legal tender restrictions and the price level. Initially, the quantity of playing card money and the government’s poor fiscal condition appears to have had little effect on prices. After 1705, however, the playing card money became inflationary. We argue that this was caused by the government’s increased enforcement of the legal tender laws and the adoption of a redemption plan intended to remove the notes from circulation.;2022;The wild card: colonial paper money in French North America, 1685 to 1719;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Dean, Jason; Geloso, Vincent";For most of Canadian economic history, French-Canadians (who composed more than a quarter of the country’s population) had living standards inferior to those of English-Canadians.

Surprisingly however, the question of when the gap started to disappeared remains unanswered. Most of the attention has been dedicated to the long-available post-1970 census data, which show rapid convergence. However, it is unknown whether the convergence started before 1970. In this paper, we use more recently uncovered data from the censuses between 1901 and 1951 to provide such an answer.

Domini, Giacomo;The complexity of a country's product mix is related to its economic growth. This paper extends this key insight from the economic growth literature to the second half of the 19th century, by reconstructing Revealed Comparative Advantages (RCA) and Economic Complexity Indices (ECI) for tens of polities, including both independent countries and colonies. It does so by exploiting product-polity information from the catalogues of five universal exhibitions, held in Paris in the second half of the 19th century (1855, 1867, 1878, 1889, 1900). For this period, exhibition data are available at a more disaggregated level than export data, on which RCA and ECI are typically based. This is the first application of ECI to the pre-Second World War era. A significant relation is observed between ECI, the level of GDP per capita, and the latter's long-run growth. Furthermore, the evolution of RCA and ECI reveals processes of structural change and economic development, notably the emergence of Germany and Switzerland, which developed along the technological paradigms of the second industrial revolution and thus attained positions of technological and economic primacy.;2022;Patterns of specialization and economic complexity through the lens of universal exhibitions, 1855-1900;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Dove, John; Byrd, William J.";An independent judiciary is a centrally important economic institution, and one that facilitates and promotes the protection of property rights, thereby fostering economic growth and development. On the other hand, extrajudicial lynchings, at least in the context of US states, have been tied to a lack of property rights and their protection (Carden in Institutions and southern development: lynching as a signal of insecure property rights. Ph.D. Dissertation. Washington University, 2006). However, these two areas of research have not been simultaneously explored. This study rectifies that by evaluating how a relatively independent judiciary might affect lynching rates across US states between 1883 and 1930. Overall, the results suggest that a relatively more independent judiciary (as measured through the method of selection and term length) is associated with a lower likelihood of observing a lynching in a given jurisdiction. This is true for both state courts of last resort and state courts of general jurisdiction.;2022;Judicial independence and lynching in historical context: an analysis of US States;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Dribe, Martin; Karlsson, Omar";This article analyses the long-term development of social class differences in infant and child mortality in an area of southern Sweden, spanning from the early stages of the mortality transition at the beginning of the nineteenth century, to the late 1960s when both infant and child mortality had reached very low levels. Our findings show that infant and child mortality was fairly equal at the beginning of the study period. We find no clear pattern of class differentials in childhood mortality in the first half of the nineteenth century when both infant and child mortality declined. Later in the nineteenth century, class differences started to emerge. This is clear for both post-neonatal mortality and child mortality, while we do not find any class differences in neonatal mortality. Over time, a more or less full gradient emerged for post-neonatal mortality, and a weak gradient also emerged for child mortality. Strikingly, the disadvantaged position for unskilled and lower-skilled workers remained throughout the 1960s, also at a time when mortality levels were very low, and living standards had increased dramatically for all classes in the population.;2022;Inequality in early life: Social class differences in childhood mortality in southern Sweden, 1815–1967;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Echavarri, Rebeca;The abnormally high sex ratio at birth (SRB) is a demographic outcome that appears in several countries in Asia and Africa and results from sex-based discrimination. Whether or not neonatal discrimination was a widespread response to socioeconomic demands during the demographic transition in Europe remains an open question. To address this concern, this paper exploits the exogenous increase in the cost of child rearing caused by the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939). Using random discontinuity techniques, a sharp and statistically significant increase in SRB appears with the war. This finding provides an opportunity to examine a challenging concern: whether neonatal discrimination fosters or reduces the discrimination suffered by girls in childhood. To examine the multiplier effects of discrimination, the paper investigates the potential role that women’s bargaining power could play in preventing the functioning of the transmission mechanism. To that end, the paper exploits historical geographical differences in women’s bargaining power that were inherent to the predominant kinship system in Spanish provinces (stem vs. nuclear). The results show that an increase of one standard deviation in the interaction term between gender and SRB led, on average, to a 9% points increase in under-five mortality in nuclear provinces. However, this positive relationship is not found in stem provinces, where women had greater bargaining power. The paper points out that policies aimed at creating a more egalitarian legal framework may fail if they are not accompanied by actions aimed at affecting beliefs and preferences for equality in society.;2022;Neonatal discrimination and excess female mortality in childhood in Spain in the first half of the twentieth century;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

However, when fiscal capacity was low, trade openness effect was negative. The results are robust to alternative measures of fiscal capacity and consistent with a placebo test.

The OAA improved retirement conditions and aimed to enable older persons to live independently. We use the transition from early elderly plans to OAA and the large differences in payments and eligibility across states to show that OAA reduced mortality by between 30 and 39 percent among those older than 65 years. This finding, based on an event study design, is robust to a range of specifications, a range of fixed effects, placebo tests, and a border-pair policy discontinuity design using county-level data.

"Gazeley, Ian; NEWELL, ANDREW; Reynolds, Kevin; Rufrancos, Hector";This article re-examines energy and nutrition available to British working-class households in the late 1930s using individual household expenditure and consumption data. We use these data to address a number of questions. First, what was the extent of malnutrition in late 1930s Britain? Second, how did the incidence change over time? Third, what were the nutritional consequences of the school meals and school milk schemes? We conclude that, for working households, energy and nutritional availability improved significantly compared with current estimates of availability before the First World War. These improvements were not equally shared, however. In the late 1930s, homes with an unemployed head of household had diets that provided around 20 per cent less energy than their working counterparts and female-headed households had diets that provided around 10 per cent fewer kcal per capita than the average male-headed household. The availability of most macro- and micronutrients showed similar relative reductions. State interventions designed to improve diet and nutrition, such as school meals and school milk, made children's diets significantly healthier, even if they did not eliminate macro- and micronutrient deficiencies completely. Not surprisingly, they made the greatest difference to children in households where the head of household was unemployed.;2022;How hungry were the poor in late 1930s Britain?†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Grytten, Ola Honningdal;This article offers revised historical national accounts for Norway for the period 1816?2019. The revisions have been carried out on both the production side and the expenditure side. The major difference is that the new series include a significantly broader set of data than the previous series. This makes it possible to calculate GDP for a wider set of industries with more detailed and precise data, in a way that is more in line with modern national accounting methodology. The new series deviate at some points from the previous series. In particular, they show higher growth rates during the last half of the nineteenth century until 1906 and lower growth rates from 1918 to 1930. This is basically due to improved quality of deflators and partly due to the extended use of a double deflation technique. The revised output and input figures play a less important role. In light of the revised series, parts of Norway's economic growth and development history should be revised. Comparisons with Denmark and Sweden reveal a relatively higher level of GDP per capita for Norway during the second half of the nineteenth century than according to the previous series.;2022;Revising growth history: new estimates of GDP for Norway, 1816–2019†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Gwaindepi, Abel;This study contributes to debates on the efficacy of institutions in settler colonies by comparing the Cape Colony’s fiscal path to the experiences of Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. I find that the Cape’s fiscal trajectory was divergent. Agricultural and mining taxes were important surrogates of income taxes in other colonies, but the Cape’s narrow interests pushed for insulation from direct taxes. This made the Cape’s fiscal path unsustainable with comparatively low per capita taxes, high deficits, and the highest level of indebtedness. I argue that the instrumentality of ‘‘responsible government” status was conditional on how imported self-government institutions were endogenized.;2022;Fiscal capacity in ‘‘responsible government’’ colonies: the Cape Colony in comparative perspective, c. 1865–1910;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Income gaps between the African majority and a tiny Asian and European income elite accounted for a large share of overall inequality. Over time, inequality among Africans increased.

Exploiting powered machinery, intangible assets, new technologies, and venture capital and generally operating in competitive markets, their exports approximately equalled domestic sales. The more capital-intensive firms accessed stock markets, more?and in larger firms?than in follower economies. Some alleged later causes of UK decline relative to the US or Germany cannot be observed in 1881. Indeed, contemporary overseas observers?capitalist and socialist?correctly recognized the distinctive features of UK manufacturing as its exceptional development of quoted corporations, professional managers, and ?modern?, scalable, factory production.;2022;Large-scale Victorian manufacturers: Reconstructing the lost 1881 UK employer census;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Hao, Yu; Li, Yuanzhe; Nye, John Vincent C.";How did the telegraph improve market integration in late imperial China? This study exploits differences in the exogenous timing of telegraph construction in different prefectures from 1870 to 1911. The empirical results show that the arrival of the telegraph within a prefecture pair reduced the ratio of the two prefectures? monthly high-grade rice prices by 6.6 percentage points in nine southern Chinese provinces, or 17.2 per cent of the mean of the dependent variable. The main results are robust to controlling for institutional or transportation changes occurring during the same period, to using an alternative measure of market integration, to using prices of mid-grade and low-grade rice, and to excluding outliers with low data quality. In addition, the effect of the telegraph was stronger for prefecture pairs in which information transmission was more costly, and traditional long-distance traders played an important role in the telegraph's promotion of market integration. In conclusion, our findings help us understand how a new information technology enhanced market integration in a premodern agrarian society with an established commercial network.;2022;Wiring China: The impact of telegraph construction on grain market integration in late imperial China, 1870–1911;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Hargaden, Enda Patrick;This paper analyzes the determinants of providing financial support to revolutionaries, using a hand-compiled dataset of 17,000 donations to the Irish National Aid Association after the Easter Rising of 1916. Financial support is best predicted by literacy, marital status, religious affiliation, and relatively high socio-economic status. In this sense, donations to revolutionaries share some characteristics of a luxury good. I find evidence that long-run historical grievances (the Great Famine) also predict support.;2022;Who donates to revolutionaries?

Herger, Nils;This paper provides a reassessment of the free-banking history of Switzerland, which included both a period of unfettered competition (1826–1881) and one of strong banknote regulation (1881–1907). Unfettered competition between note-issuing banks gave rise to a fragmented paper-money system, with limited liquidity banknotes. To increase confidence in these notes, the federal government introduced a minimum-reserve requirement and a mutual-conversion rule in 1881. Based on a theoretical model and new empirical evidence, this paper shows that this enhanced regulation came at a cost, as it led to the overissuing of banknotes and an inelastic paper-money supply.;2022;Unregulated and regulated free banking: Evidence from the case of Switzerland (1826–1907);Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Hersh, Jonathan; Voth, Hans-Joachim";When did overseas trade start to matter for living standards? Traditional real-wage indices suggest that living standards in Europe stagnated before 1800. In this paper, we argue that welfare may have actually risen substantially, but surreptitiously, because of an influx of new goods. Colonial “luxuries” such as tea, coffee, and sugar became highly coveted. Together with more simple household staples such as potatoes and tomatoes, overseas goods transformed European diets after the discovery of America and the rounding of the Cape of Good Hope. They became household items in many countries by the end of the 18th century. We apply two standard methods to calculate broad orders of magnitude of the resulting welfare gains. While they cannot be assessed precisely, gains from greater variety may well have been big enough to boost European real incomes by 10% or more (depending on the assumptions used).;2022;Sweet diversity: Colonial goods and the welfare gains from global trade after 1492;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Horrell, Sara; Humphries, Jane; Weisdorf, Jacob L.";This article provides a novel framework within which to evaluate real household incomes of predominantly rural working families of various sizes and structures in England in the years 1260?1850. We reject ahistorical assumptions about complete reliance on men's wages and male breadwinning, moving closer to reality by including women and children's contributions to family incomes. Our empirical strategy benefits from recent estimates of men's annual earnings, so avoiding the need to gross up day rates using problematic assumptions about days worked, and from new data on women and children's wages and labour inputs. A family life-cycle approach which accommodates consumption smoothing through saving adds further breadth and realism. Moreover, the analysis embraces two historically common but often overlooked family types alternative to the traditional male-breadwinner model: one where the husband is missing having died or deserted, and one where the husband is present but unwilling or unable to find work. Our framework suggests living standards varied widely by family structure and dependency ratio. Incorporating detailed demographic data available for 1560 onward suggests that small and intact families enjoyed high and rising living standards after 1700, while large or disrupted families depended on child labour and poor relief until c. 1830. A broader perspective on family structures informs understanding of the chronology and nature of poverty and coping strategies.;2022;Beyond the male breadwinner: Life-cycle living standards of intact and disrupted English working families, 1260–1850;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Hungerland, Wolf-Fabian; WOLF, NIKOLAUS";We present and analyze the panopticon of Germany’s foreign trade, with new data on all products, all trade partners, quantities, and values, at annual frequency, 1880–1913. Historical product categories are reclassified according to the Standard International Trade Classification (SITC) to ensure comparability over time and across countries. Germany became increasingly specialized in manufacturing, in line with theories of comparative advantage. However, most trade growth occurred along the extensive margin, and 20–25 percent of trade was intra-industry trade, at five-digit SITC. Both facts suggest substantial within-sector heterogeneity. We discuss why this matters for our understanding of the first globalization.;2022;The panopticon of Germany’s foreign trade, 1880–1913: New facts on the first globalization;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Evidence from pre-1945 cohorts is sparse, mostly from the United States, and evidence is mixed on long-term changes in the risk of being overweight. We develop a dataset of men entering the NZ army in the two world wars, with objectively measured height and weight, and socioeconomic status in early adulthood. Our sample includes significant numbers of indigenous Māori, providing estimates of weight and mortality risk in an indigenous population. We follow men from war's end until death, with data on more than 12,000 men from each war. Overweight and obesity were important risk factors for mortality, and associated with shorter life expectancy. However, the reduction in life expectancy associated with being overweight declined from 5 to 3 years between the two cohorts, consistent with the hypothesis that being overweight became less risky during the twentieth century;2022;The mortality risk of being overweight in the twentieth century: Evidence from two cohorts of New Zealand men;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Jaworski, Taylor; Keay, Ian";The dramatic decrease in international trade costs in the second half of the nineteenth century led to a global trade boom. In this paper, we examine the consequences of greater openness to international trade for regional economic activity in a small, open economy during the first era of globalization. Specifically, we provide a quantitative assessment of the role that exposure to globalization played in industrialization in Canada between 1871 and 1891. Greater exposure to globalization leads to faster growth of manufacturing and the greater concentration of industry around entrepôts of trade between Canada and the rest of the world.;2022;Globalization and the spread of industrialization in Canada, 1871–1891;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Jensen, Peter Sandholt; Pedersen, Maja Uhre; Radu, Cristina Victoria; Sharp, Paul Richard";The Malthusian model is the subject of a fierce debate within economic history. Although the positive causal relationship postulated from living standards to population growth is relatively uncontroversial for preindustrial societies, this cannot be said for the other key relationship, diminishing returns due to fixed supplies of land. We argue that Denmark, which was characterized by extreme resource and environmental constraints until the final decades of the eighteenth century, provides an ideal setting for testing whether any society was ever truly Malthusian. We employ a cointegrated VAR model on Danish data from 1731 to 1800, finding evidence for diminishing returns until ca. 1775. Yet this relationship disappears in the late-eighteenth century, consistent with an increasing pace of technological progress and the emergence of what Unified Growth Theory has termed the “post-Malthusian” era.;2022;Arresting the Sword of Damocles: The transition to the post-Malthusian era in Denmark;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

We also find that IPOs are timed to coincide with favorable market conditions. Our model explains almost 50 percent of the fluctuations and most of the hot markets. To further understand IPO waves, we conduct a descriptive analysis, which yields two additional causes for hot markets, i.e., high capital needs and investors’ expectations for specific industries.;2022;What causes hot markets for equity IPOs?

Korchmina, Elena;How can developing countries successfully implement an income tax in the absence of a strong state? Recent theoretical research has suggested a possible solution: relying on voluntary compliance with tax demands can avoid the need for costly enforcement. This article provides empirical evidence for such a mechanism by investigating the introduction of the income tax in Russia in 1812. It uses a novel dataset to estimate the individual-level tax compliance of Russian nobles. The dataset is constructed from self-reported tax returns of all Russian aristocrats (around 4?000) who owned real estate in Moscow province. On the basis of both private narrative sources and state financial documents, findings show that the Russian nobility reliably declared their income: only 10 to 30 per cent of aristocrats evaded tax despite the limited legal repercussions of doing so. This surprisingly high level of tax compliance was achieved by the threat of public disclosure, whereby nobles had to declare their incomes to their peers. Nobles could face reputational risks from attempted evasion, particularly in the shadow of the looming Napoleonic invasion. Russia thus achieved its fiscal aims despite its low administrative capacity and without resorting to coercion.;2022;Peer pressure: The puzzle of aristocrats’ tax compliance in early nineteenth-century Moscow;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Kotsadam, Andreas; Lind, Jo Thori; Modalsli, Jørgen";At the turn of the twentieth century, Norway, like many other countries, experienced a decrease in mortality and a substantial increase in the number of health personnel. In order to assess how these changes were connected, we investigate the relationship between health personnel and mortality using data at the medical district level (N=106) covering a period of 34 years. We find a large and robust effect of midwives on reduced maternal mortality in rural areas, but no effect in urban areas. No clear effect is found for other types of health personnel or on infant mortality.

"Kramer, Bert S.; Milionis, Petros";We study how political institutions affected the decision of countries to adhere to the classical gold standard. Using a variety of econometric techniques and controlling for a wide range of relevant economic and political factors, we find that the probability of adherence to the gold standard before World War I was ceteris paribus lower for countries which were more democratic. This effect can be linked to how open the political process was to different segments of the population and the extent of political competition resulting from that. The effect was particularly relevant for peripheral countries and it influenced both the decision of countries to adopt the gold standard as well as the decision to suspend it.;2022;Democratic constraints and adherence to the classical gold standard;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Kufenko, Vadim; Khaustova, Ekaterina; Geloso, Vincent";Did late Imperial Russia suffer from Malthusian pressures? At first glance, with its rising levels of population and per capita income, it seems Russia was in a transition away from Malthusian equilibrium. However, the joint increase in population and per capita income could also have been the result of Russia’s high land-to-labor ratio. Which of the two is it? Such a problem is a frequent one in economic history, as many frontier economies have high land-to-labor ratios, which foil the researcher’s ability to determine whether an economy was transitioning or whether it was growing because of weak land constraints. In this paper, we use quarterly demographic and economic data from Moscow (which we take as a proxy for Russia) in conjunction with a Cointegrated Vector Autoregression approach to determine whether the Russian economy was transitioning away from a Malthusian equilibrium. We find signs of Malthusian pressures still operating while wages had stopped responding to changes in death and birth rates. This combination suggests that a vulnerable transition was truly underway even though a Malthusian shadow remained.;2022;Escape underway: Malthusian pressures in late imperial Moscow;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Kulkarni, Parashar; Pfaff, Steven";We examine a tumultuous period in Scottish history beginning from the Reformation in 1560 until a few years after the Revolution of 1688. During this period, the Crown repeatedly provoked political crises by attempting to impose an episcopal structure on the Church of Scotland. Using time series data of witch accusations, we find that the Scottish Presbyterians were substantially more active in persecuting alleged witches during periods when they were excluded from power. Although monopoly churches can be instruments of state-making and social order, our results show that the disciplinary instruments of an established church can be turned against the state. In polities divided by factional religious conflict the suppression of sectarian groups can lead them to impose religious discipline as a counterweight to state formation.;2022;Church politics, sectarianism, and judicial terror: The Scottish witch-hunt, 1563 - 1736;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
La Prados De Escosura, Leandro;The rising trend in the capital-output ratio and the productivity slowdown have put capital back in the economist’s agenda. This paper contributes to the debate by providing new estimates of net capital stock and services for Spain over the last 170 years. The net capital (wealth) stock-GDP ratio rose over time and doubled in the last half a century. Capital services grew fast over the long run accelerating in the 1920s and from the mid-1950s to 2007. Until 1975, its acceleration was helped by an increase in the “quality” of capital. Capital deepening proceeded steadily, accelerating during 1955–1985 and slowing down thereafter for expanding sectors attracted less investment-specific technological progress. Although capital consumption rose over time, the rate of depreciation fell from 1970 to 2007 as new capital goods’ relative prices declined due to embodied technological change.;2022;Capital in Spain, 1850–2019;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"La Prados De Escosura, Leandro; Álvarez-Nogal, Carlos; Santiago Caballero, Carlos";Research in economic history has challenged a strict Malthusian depiction of preindustrial European economies, highlighting ‘efflorescences’, ‘Smithian’ and ‘growth recurring’ episodes. Do these defining concepts apply to preindustrial Spain? In this paper, we carry out new yearly estimates of output and population for over half-a millennium. We find that our estimates of agricultural output on the basis of tithes largely confirm those obtained using a demand function approach supporting its use in the absence of direct information. We show that, although levels of output per head in the early nineteenth century were not much different from those in the eve of the Black Death, preindustrial Spain was far from stagnant. Phases of simultaneous per capita output and population expansion and shrinkage alternated, lending support to the recurring growth and frontier economy hypotheses. A long phase of sustained growth and lower inequality collapsed in the 1570s and gave way to another one of sluggish growth and higher inequality. As an alternative to a Malthusian interpretation, we hypothesise that, in preindustrial Spain, growth and decline are largely explained by individual and collective economic decisions.;2022;Growth recurring in preindustrial Spain?;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Ljungqvist, Fredrik Charpentier; Thejll, Peter; Christiansen, Bo; Seim, Andrea; Hartl, Claudia; Esper, Jan";Grain was the most important food source in early modern Europe (c. 1500–1800), and its price influenced the entire economy. The extent to which climate variability determined grain price variations remains contested, and claims of solar cycle influences on prices are disputed. We thoroughly reassess these questions, within a framework of comprehensive statistical analysis, by employing an unprecedentedly large grain price data set together with state-of-the-art palaeoclimate reconstructions and long meteorological series. A highly significant negative grain price–temperature relationship (i.e. colder = high prices and vice versa) is found across Europe. This association increases at larger spatial and temporal scales and reaches a correlation of −0.41 considering the European grain price average and previous year June–August temperatures at annual resolution, and of −0.63 at decadal timescales. This strong relationship is of episodic rather than periodic (cyclic) nature. Only weak and spatially inconsistent signals of hydroclimate (precipitation and drought), and no meaningful association with solar variations, are detected in the grain prices. The significant and persistent temperature effects on grain prices imply that this now rapidly changing climate element has been a more important factor in European economic history, even in southern Europe, than commonly acknowledged.;2022;The significance of climate variability on early modern European grain prices;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Matringe, Nadia;Studies of the early modern exchange market have usually focused on the strategies of traders who made profits from differences in exchange rates. This article instead focuses on the inventory management practices of exchange dealers, who traded almost exclusively on behalf of third parties while acting as market makers in the Lyon fairs in the sixteenth century. Using evidence from 1?937 transactions performed by one of the major Lyon banks (Salviati), it uncovers a specific rebalancing technique based on the use of the bill of exchange as a netting instrument. Thanks to a system of limit orders, the Lyon exchange dealers were able to offset order flows, thus minimizing their credit risk while remaining exposed to reputational risk. Such a rebalancing mechanism involved multiple clients and markets and contributed to the clearing of international payments once bills reached maturity. Double-entry bookkeeping both facilitated and limited the use of the bill of exchange as a multilateral netting instrument.;2022;Early inventory management practices in the foreign exchange market: Insights from sixteenth-century Lyon;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"MAW, PETER; Solar, Peter M.; Kane, Aidan; Lyons, John S.";This article analyses the improvement of cotton-spinning technologies in the years after the great inventions of Hargreaves, Arkwright, and Crompton. While these ?macro-inventions? have attracted considerable historical attention, our understanding of the major changes in types and sizes of spinning machines used in the UK between the 1780s and the onset of state-collected factory statistics in the 1830s is still largely based on the experience of high-profile firms or specific technologies and regions. A new dataset of 1,465 machinery advertisements published in newspapers in England, Scotland, and Ireland between 1780 and 1835 allows us to examine the temporal and spatial dimensions of the market for cotton-spinning machinery, the timings of transitions between different spinning machines, and increases in machine size. The article demonstrates the importance of post-invention technical improvements in the cotton industry, showing that the productivity increases associated with the initial transition from hand to machine spinning have been overstated and that larger gains were made in the ?micro-invention? phase, when spinning machines became larger and faster, and required fewer workers to operate them.;2022;After the great inventions: technological change in UK cotton spinning, 1780–1835;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Specifically, the career incentives and promotion prospects of local officials influence how they spend local resources which in turn impacts local economic growth. We utilize the unique historical case of Edo Japan to explore the effect of institutionalized political relations between central and local governments. We argue that fudai daimyos, or political insiders, who had access to important positions in the central administration expended their local resources to benefit their own careers at a cost to local development. We analyze both macro (domain) and micro (village) level data, and use an instrumental variable approach to causally identify the economic consequences of career incentives and promotion prospects. We find that growth in agricultural output was around 10–16 percentage points lower for fudai domains/villages in the Edo Period, which is a magnitude comparable to the difference in growth rates between China and France in the same period.;2022;Political centralization, career incentives, and local economic growth in Edo Japan;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

We use panel data techniques to analyze more than 2000 strikes in 103 Swedish towns. We find that a shift of political majority towards the Social Democrats led to a significant decline in strikes, but only in towns where union presence was strong.

Montalbo, Adrien;In this article, I investigate the long run relationship between education, industrialisation and growth. I evaluate the impact of primary schooling on the economic development of France between the 1830s and 1914. To do so, I rely on very precise data on education at the level of municipalities. I instrument educational achievements, namely enrolment rates and schooling years, by the proximity of municipalities to printing presses established before 1500. This method returns a positive impact of an early high educational achievement on growth during the nineteenth century. This indicates a positive effect of the acquisition of basic education and elementary skills on the development of French municipalities. Therefore, the accumulation of human capital within primary schools contributed positively to growth during the nineteenth century and up to World War I, the core period of modernisation and industrialisation in France.;2022;Primary education and economic growth in nineteenth-century France;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Mühlhoff, Katharina;Declining mortality seems a natural explanation for the demographic transition. However, many economists have discarded improved infant survival as a causal trigger. Moreover, certain currents in Neo-Malthusian economics point to potentially beneficial side-effects of population shocks. Based on historical demography and evolutionary science, I challenge these views. The argument is that uncontrollable (“extrinsic”) mortality creates selective advantages for families with many “cheap” offspring, whereas stable environments favor child “quality”. Combining “life-history-theory” and a unified growth model, I demonstrate that declining mortality and medical progress facilitate the transition towards growth-promoting “low-fertility-high-quality” phenotypes. As it will turn out, this framework produces qualitatively and quantitatively closer predictions of the historical fertility decline than standard models of the Barro–Becker type. Moreover, evolutionary mechanisms provide a parsimonious explanation for diverse demographic transition patterns. Thus, evolved adaptations add a new and culture-free mechanism to older theories. Moreover, regarding sustainable growth, they suggest that natural selection eventually offsets the benefits from population shocks claimed by Malthusian theories.;2022;Darwin beats malthus: evolutionary anthropology, human capital and the demographic transition;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Partisan newspapers benefitted party vote shares, with stronger effects in federal elections than in local elections. The electoral influence of newspapers was driven by tabloids and mass newspapers, and not by elite political newspapers.;2022;Political power of the press in the Weimar Republic;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Data show the paradoxical coexistence of high urbanization levels with cyclical Malthusian stagnations.

Although book ownership was very high from an early date, it was associated with signature literacy, gender, urbanization, and wealth in ways inconsistent with its having registered economically relevant human capital. The books people owned were overwhelmingly religious, as elsewhere in pre-modern Europe. People consumed books for multifarious purposes, many of them non-economic. In this pre-modern economy, books were not a good indicator of economically relevant human capital for the population at large, which creates doubt about their use for this purpose more generally.;2022;Economically relevant human capital or multi-purpose consumption good?

Perrin, Faustine;Why did France experience the demographic transition first? This question remains one of the greatest puzzles of economics, demography, and economic history. The French pattern is hard to reconcile with elucidations of the process as found in other countries. The present analysis goes back to the roots of the process and offers novel ways of explaining why people started to control their fertility in France and how they did so. In this paper, I track the evolution of marriage patterns to a point before the premises of the demographic transition. I identify two distinct phases. Next, I rely on exploratory methods to classify French counties based on their discriminatory features. Five profiles emerge. I discuss these profiles through the lens of the French Revolution, one of the greatest events that ever occurred in French history, which irretrievably altered its society. In particular, the results show that the fertility transition was not as linear, but more complex than previous research had argued. They show the importance of accounting for cultural factors and for individuals’ predispositions to adapt more or less quickly to societal changes. Yet cultural factors are not all. They can help to explain the timing of the transition and the choice of methods used to control fertility, but modernity and gender equality are also needed to describe the mechanisms in play behind the process.;2022;On the origins of the demographic transition: rethinking the European marriage pattern;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Poelmans, Eline; Taylor, Jason E.; Raisanen, Samuel; Holt, Andrew C.";In April 1933, eight months prior to the end of Prohibition, states within the US gained the ability to legalize 3.2 percent alcohol beer. Proponents of legalization predicted that the brewer's dray would bring jobs along with beer. We estimate that legalization brought around 81,000 jobs between April and June of 1933, 60,000 of which were created in April, when the nation emerged from the trough of the Great Depression. This suggests that around 5.6 percent of nationwide non-agricultural spring employment gains, and around 15 percent of April job gains, were associated with beer legalization.

The most persistent shocks occurred at the time of the Black Death and the twentieth century's world wars. Our findings confirm that the Black Death often resulted in higher income levels but reject the view of a uniform long-term response to the Plague. In fact, we find a negative impact on incomes in non-Malthusian economies. In the North Sea Area (Britain and the Netherlands), the Plague was followed by positive trend growth in output per capita and population, heralding the onset of modern economic growth and the Great Divergence in Eurasia.;2022;War, pandemics, and modern economic growth in Europe;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Raven, Matt;"The medieval English wool trade was a commercial activity of huge economic importance. The historiography of the medieval wool trade, however, has focused overwhelmingly on its legitimate side. This article uses the evidence of legal proceedings prosecuted in the royal courts to provide the first detailed account of wool smuggling in the fourteenth century, a time of heavy governmental regulation and hugely increased taxation. It demonstrates that a substantial number of merchants responded to these challenges by participating in a flourishing trade in smuggled wool which was considered a serious threat to crown fiscality. In particular, the article explores how smaller-scale smuggling took place along under-regulated areas of coastline away from customs ports; how major export operations were able to smuggle wool through the customs system itself; and how concerns over smuggling influenced a series of administrative reforms designed to improve the efficiency of commercial regulation.";2022;Wool smuggling from England's eastern seaboard, c. 1337–45: An illicit economy in the late middle ages;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Riahi, Ideen A.;The abundance of domesticable mammals in Eurasia facilitated its early transition from hunter–gatherer to agricultural economies, with dramatic consequences for human history. This paper empirically examines the origins of these biogeographical advantages and finds that the extinction of large mammals during the past 100,000 years was a decisive force in the evolution of mammal domestication. In Eurasia’s domestication cradles, humans had sufficient incentives to continually practice herd management as a hunting strategy to prevent the depletion of their vital common resources. These strategies changed some targeted species and made them more receptive to human domination. The absence of these conditions (human incentive and animal receptivity) in other regions resulted in the paucity of domestication. The paper presents the most comprehensive empirical analysis of the origins of animal domestication and the roots of global inequalities to date and unearths a critical channel for the influence of deep history on comparative economic development.;2022;Why Eurasia?

Rodger, Richard;The internal structure of the city is analysed through the ownership, tenancy, and management of residential property using assessed rents to reflect current market value. The analysis reveals the interactions of agents, institutions, and trusts, and explores ownership in terms of gender, absenteeism, occupational categories, portfolio sizes, and values. Rents are used to develop both an index of housing affordability according to occupations, and an index of dissimilarity in rental variations within and between streets to provide a nuanced and more realistic understanding of the internal dynamics of an entire city?Edinburgh. While empirical material underpinning the analysis is place-specific, the underlying urban processes and relationships are generalizable, and provide a comprehensive overview of residential property relationships.;2022;Property and inequality: Housing dynamics in a nineteenth-century city;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Rönnbäck, Klas; Broberg, Oskar; Galli, Stefania";Historical rates of return on investments have received increasing scholarly attention in recent years. Much literature has focused especially on colonies, where institutions have been argued to facilitate severe exploitation. In the present study, we examine the return on investments in an Asian colony, British Malaya, from 1889 to 1969 for a large sample of companies. Our results suggest that the return on investments in Malaya might have been among the highest in the world during the period studied. Nevertheless, this finding fits badly with theories of imperial exploitation and can only to a limited extent be explained by a higher risk premium. Instead, we argue that the main driver of the very high return on investments in Malaya was rather the substantial rise in global market prices of the output of the two main sectors of the Malayan economy, rubber and tin. The way that the process of decolonization unfolded in Malaya did, furthermore, not lead to any major nationalization of foreign-held assets, and did thereby not disrupt the return on investment in the region in the same way as decolonization did to the return on investment in some other colonies.;2022;A colonial cash cow: the return on investments in British Malaya, 1889–1969;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Schneider, Sabine;News of the insolvency of Overend, Gurney, & Company on 10 May 1866 generated a scramble for funds in the City of London and urgent appeals to the Bank of England. The banking panic triggered by the collapse of the prominent British discount house became one of the Bank's most tumultuous modern crises. This article investigates the politics of the Bank's liquidity provision during the 1866 crisis, and in the ensuing months of financial stringency. By assessing the correspondence, speeches, and publications of Governors, City figures, and financial journalists, the article finds that the Bank's evolving approach to crisis lending was decisively shaped by its commercial objectives and a prolonged struggle to preserve its autonomy. When confronted with the 1866 crisis, the Bank adopted a pragmatic stance towards the market, which accommodated the credit needs of the City without sacrificing either its privileged legal status or its shareholders? interests. Its Governors? rhetorical pursuit of ?constructive ambiguity? during the post-crisis months succeeded in both limiting moral hazard and consolidating the Bank's discretionary powers.;2022;The politics of last resort lending and the Overend & Gurney crisis of 1866;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Sissoko, Carolyn;This article studies the changes that took place in the Bank of England's Restriction-era policies governing private sector lending. The findings show that the Bank was adapting to novel monetary circumstances, created both by the evolution of the English financial system and by the Restriction itself, and that, although the process was far from smooth, the Bank was learning to act as a central bank: during this period the Bank transformed its internal operating procedures to put regulation-based constraints on its private sector lending, established regular reviews of its policies and their effects on the money market, and adopted a distinct crisis-orientated lending policy. In addition to establishing that these core central bank activities developed over this period, the article also shows that for 18 months starting in 1809 the Bank's policies were destabilizing, and that the Bullion Committee probably played a role in a shift in Bank lending policies that took place in mid-1810. Overall, this study finds that the 1810 crisis was a turning point in the Bank's understanding of its role in the economy: the Bank directors both acknowledged privately the Bank's duty to the public, and restructured its discount policies with a view to promoting financial and monetary stability.;2022;Becoming a central bank: The development of the Bank of England's private sector lending policies during the Restriction;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
SLACK, PAUL;Major epidemics of plague in Germany and France in the early eighteenth century and in Moscow in the 1770s brought an end to a series of epidemic disasters in Europe which had started with the Black Death. The article examines what they had in common, and seeks to understand why they should have ended when they did. It shows that European governors were unanimous in insisting on rigid quarantine and other measures for containing the disease developed over previous centuries, despite their ignorance of plague's precise causes. It shows also that physicians across Europe were more deeply divided than they had ever been on the issue of contagion, and now engaged in an international dispute about whether the acknowledged cruelties inflicted by compulsory quarantines were wholly counterproductive, or a price worth paying for the prevention of still worse disasters. The article concludes by drawing on recent work on plague in the Ottoman Empire, and on research into the ancient DNA of the second pandemic, in order to set the epidemic history of western Europe in a wider comparative context.;2022;Perceptions of plague in eighteenth-century Europe†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Tadei, Federico;It has often been claimed that the structure of export trade between Africa and Europe during the colonial period depended on the colonizer's identity, with the British relying on free trade and the French, in contrast, employing monopsonistic policies. However, due to the lack of systematic data on colonial trade, this claim has remained untested. This study uses recently available data on export prices from African colonies to estimate monopsonistic profit margins for British and French trading companies. The results challenge the view of the British colonizers as champions of free trade. The level of profit margins was determined much more by the local conditions in Africa (history of trade and the presence of European producers) than by the identity of the colonial power. The British did not necessarily rely on free trade more than the French and did so only when implementing monopsonies was not a viable option.;2022;Colonizer identity and trade in Africa: Were the British more favourable to free trade?;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Torregrosa Hetland, Sara; Sabaté, Oriol";This paper studies the impact of inflation on income taxes in Sweden, the UK, and the United States during the world wars. As tax reforms were rising top marginal rates and reducing exemption thresholds, extraordinary levels of inflation eroded the real value of exemptions, brackets, and deductions. The micro-simulation of actual and alternative scenarios shows that inflation made the tax less progressive, particularly in Sweden during World War I and the UK during World War II. Nevertheless, its redistributive effect increased due to the related growth in tax revenue. Inflation contributed to transform a “class tax’’ into a “mass tax”.;2022;Income tax progressivity and inflation during the world wars;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Tunçer, Ali Coşkun; Weller, Leonardo";This article tests the influential democratic advantage hypothesis – that democratic governments have historically borrowed more cheaply than autocratic governments – in the context of the first financial globalization, from circa 1870 to 1913. We construct indicators of political regime types, then regress government bond spreads of 27 independent capital-importing countries on them. In contrast with the mainstream literature, the results suggest that democracies were associated with higher country risk. Our findings indicate that autocratic regimes had a significant advantage: democracies paid 5.7% more on their debt than autocracies, controlling for several financial and political variables. This gap is the equivalent of 35.4% of the negative effect defaults had on credit costs. Our conclusions hold when allowing for different definitions of political regime type and bond spreads. The correlations identified also find support in qualitative evidence, according to which creditors favored autocracies for being politically more stable than democracies.;2022;Democracy, autocracy, and sovereign debt: How polity influenced country risk on the peripheries of the global economy, 1870–1913;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"van Besouw, Bram; Curtis, Daniel R.";Early modern warfare in Western Europe exposed civilian populations to violence, hardship, and disease. Despite limited empirical evidence, the ensuing mortality effects are regularly invoked by economic historians to explain patterns of economic development. Using newly collected data on adult burials and war events in the seventeenth-century Low Countries, we estimate early modern war-driven mortality in localities close to military activity. We find a clear and significant general mortality effect consistent with the localized presence of diseases. During years with major epidemic disease outbreaks, we demonstrate a stronger and more widely spreading mortality effect. However, war-driven mortality increases during epidemic years are of similar relative magnitude is those in non-epidemic war years. Given the omnipresence of warfare in the seventeenth-century Low Countries, war-driven mortality was remarkably constant rather than a sharp discontinuity. The economic impact of warfare likely played out over the long term rather than driven by sudden large mortality spikes creating rapid structural change.;2022;Estimating warfare-related civilian mortality in the early modern period: Evidence from the Low Countries, 1620–99;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"van Zanden, Jan Luiten; FELICE, EMANUELE";The article presents GDP estimates for fifteenth century Tuscany, based on the 1427 Florentine Catasto. In per capita GDP, Tuscany was only slightly above England and Holland. Furthermore, when compared to England and Holland, Tuscany was characterized by high extractive rates in favor of Florence, to the detriment of the subdued cities and the countryside, and by subsequent market blockades. This may explain why previous estimates, partly based on the construction wages in Florence, can lead to an overestimate of GDP. It may also explain the exceptional artistic blossoming of fifteenth century Florence, despite only a small lead in average GDP.;2022;Benchmarking the Middle Ages: fifteenth century Tuscany in European perspective;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Varian, Brian D.;In the Edwardian era, the British Dominions adopted policies of imperial preference amid a period of rising imports from the United States and industrial continental Europe. Hitherto, there has been no econometric assessment of whether these policies diverted the Dominions? imports towards the Empire, as was intended. This article focuses on New Zealand's initial policy of imperial preference, codified in the Preferential and Reciprocal Trade Act of 1903. New Zealand's policy was unique insofar as it extended preference to only certain commodities and not others. Using propensity score matching, this study exploits the cross-commodity variation in the extension of preference and finds that, on the whole, the Preferential and Reciprocal Trade Act did not divert New Zealand's imports towards the Empire. However, for those few commodities receiving very high absolute margins of preference (20 per cent ad valorem), a statistically significant effect of the preferential policy is found. Altogether, this case study of New Zealand reveals a contrast between the Edwardian system of imperial preference and the trade-diverting system of imperial preference that resulted from the Ottawa Agreements of the interwar era.;2022;Imperial preference before the Ottawa Agreements: Evidence from New Zealand's Preferential and Reciprocal Trade Act of 1903;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Voutilainen, Miikka;This article examines whether economic inequality intensified the adverse effects of harvest, price, and income shocks during a famine. Using a parish-level longitudinal dataset from the Finnish famine of the 1860s, it shows that a substantial proportion of the excess mortality experienced during the famine resulted from a decline in agricultural production, a decline in incomes, and a surge in food prices. The findings indicate that the adverse effects of food output fluctuations were intensified by increasing income inequality and decreasing average income, while the market-transmitted shocks were weakened by a contraction of disposable income. The results are corroborated with multiple alternative estimation techniques, including the introduction of spatial spill-overs. The results show that even a pre-industrial famine affecting an impoverished society was meaningfully defined by the distribution of incomes.;2022;Income inequality and famine mortality: Evidence from the Finnish famine of the 1860s;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Webster, Ian;How did local authorities in nineteenth-century England raise the money to finance the building of roads, sewers, gasworks, schools, and hospitals? The literature on local government and capital markets is silent on this question. This article reveals the size of the municipal capital market, how and why it developed, and how it performed. It shows that most of the capital came from private individuals and institutions, with central government having only a modest role. Avoiding defaults, protecting lenders, the move towards standardization, and the development of open markets were all important in improving the credibility of borrowers and reducing the cost of debt. The article also reveals that the municipal capital market shared many similarities with the wider capital market.;2022;Making the municipal capital market in nineteenth-century England†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
White, Lawrence H.;Prominent economists have supposed that the private production of full-bodied gold or silver coins is inefficient: due to information asymmetry, private coins will be chronically low-quality or underweight. An examination of private mints during gold rushes in the US in the years 1830?63, drawing on contemporary accounts and numismatic literature, finds otherwise. While some private gold mints produced underweight coins, from incompetence or fraudulent intent, such mints did not last long. Informed by newspapers about the findings of assays, money-users systematically abandoned substandard coins in favour of full-weight coins. Only competent and honest mints survived.;2022;The private mint in economics: evidence from the American gold rushes†;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Xu, Mingjie;This article throws new light on the forces that propelled the Peasants? Revolt of 1381 by focusing closely on the actions of the rebels, the number and nature of the attacks they carried out, and the identities, status, and roles of their victims. The exceptionally rich and comprehensive records of the violence and disorder that occurred in Cambridgeshire have been systematically studied and each incident analysed, categorized, and quantified. The results reveal that attacks in this region were overwhelmingly directed against political and judicial officials operating at a national and local level, and that attacks against landlords arising from oppressive manorial lordship constituted less than one-tenth of recorded violent incidents. The use of similar analysis of the actions of rebels recorded in the judicial proceedings of revolts in other regions may lessen the scale of the contention that still exists over the grievances that provoked this momentous uprising and who the rebels judged to be their main adversaries.;2022;Analysing the actions of the rebels in the English Revolt of 1381: The case of Cambridgeshire;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Yang, Cheng;Based on the Xingke Tiben, this paper assesses the long-run economic development of China, by constructing a new estimate of male occupational structure during 1734?1898 by sector, sub-sector pattern, and region. After assessing the source's biases, using this new empirical basis, this paper demonstrates that the national male occupational structure was nearly identical in 1761?70, 1821?30, and 1881?90, suggesting a long-lasting structural stasis of the national economy, allowing for fluctuations between benchmark dates. Within agriculture, substantial regional differences in labour organisation are revealed. Three distinct models are found: the Northern Regions model features a high usage of wage labour, the Yangtze Valley model presents a high level of tenancy development, and the Southern Regions model displays the highest share of landowners. All three models saw increasing use of wage labour in 1761?1890 and shrinking landownership in 1821?90. At the regional level, the long-run estimate for Lower Yangtze suggests that the region as a whole stagnated throughout the entire period, but the overall structural stasis hides dynamic, contrasting long-run economic change between the region's core and peripheral areas. Comparative analysis with England further suggests that the timing of the Great Divergence between China and England took place before 1734, even in the context of the regional difference.;2022;A new estimate of Chinese male occupational structure during 1734–1898 by sector, sub-sector pattern, and region;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Zimran, Ariell;I study the rates of, selection into, and sorting of European immigrants’ secondary migration within the United States and their geographic assimilation during the Age of Mass Migration. These phenomena are recognized as important components of the economics of immigration, but data constraints have limited prior study of them in this context. As part of the debate over immigrant distribution, they were also major issues in the broader twentieth-century immigration policy debate, which was influenced by the widely held view that immigrants in the early twentieth century were less geographically mobile and specifically more attached to urban areas than were natives and earlier immigrants. I find that immigrants throughout the Age of Mass Migration were at least as likely as natives to make inter-county moves, were more attached to urban areas, were more likely to move to urban destinations, and shared natives’ increasing attachment to urban areas over time. In spite of their mobility, immigrants experienced relatively little assimilation in their place-of-residence distributions relative to natives with time in the United States, though they did experience somewhat more convergence on natives in terms of urbanization. These results help to better understand immigrant assimilation and the effects of immigration during the Age of Mass Migration and imply that the contemporary views of immigrant immobility were either false, oversimplified, or the product of changes in the US economy.;2022;US immigrants’ secondary migration and geographic assimilation during the Age of Mass Migration;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Zwart, Pim de;This paper adds to a growing literature that charts and explains inequality levels in pre-industrial societies. On the basis of a wide variety of primary documents, the degree of inequality is estimated for 32 different residencies, the largest administrative units and comparable to present-day provinces, of late colonial Indonesia. Four different measures of inequality (the Gini, Theil, Inequality Extraction Rate and Top Income Rate) are employed that show consistent results. Variation in inequality levels across late colonial Indonesia is very large, and some residencies have much higher levels of inequality (with, for example, Ginis above 60) than others (with Ginis below 30). This suggests that even within a single colony, levels of inequality may vary substantially and this puts some doubts on the representativeness of using a single number to capture the level of inequality in a large economy. In order to explain the variation across residencies and over time, this paper investigates the role of exports and plantations, so frequently mentioned in the literature. It is shown that both explain a part of the variation in levels of inequality across colonial Indonesia, but that only the rise of plantations can explain changes in inequality levels over time. This points to the importance of the institutional context in which global export trade takes place for the rise of inequality.;2022;Inequality in late colonial Indonesia: new evidence on regional differences;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Absell, Christopher David;This paper studies the effect of British slave emancipation on the sugar industry in the north-east of Brazil. Combining pre-existing annual data on Brazilian exports and British, French, American and Hanseatic imports with a new monthly series of imports to Liverpool and New York, I argue that the British policies following emancipation were related to a rapid increase in the demand for Brazilian sugar in the British market towards the end of mid-century. The results of an interrupted time series analysis show that the effect was particularly large following the end of apprenticeship in 1838 and the passage of the Sugar Act in 1846. I estimate that over the period 1827–1853, slave emancipation increased Brazil’s market share by around five per cent, which corresponded to between 15 and 28 per cent of the volume of Brazilian exports. A comparison with markets unaffected by such policy treatments demonstrates that these trends were confined to the British market.;2023;British slave emancipation and the demand for Brazilian sugar;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Aidt, Toke S.; Davenport, Romola J.; Gray, Felix";"Health improved in English cities in the last third of the nineteenth century, in tandem with substantial increases in public spending on water supplies and sanitation. However, previous efforts to measure the contribution of public expenditures to mortality improvements have been hampered by difficulties in quantifying public health investments and the lack of mortality data for specifically urban populations. We improve upon the existing evidence base by (1) creating measures of the stock of urban district sanitary capital, by type, on the basis of capital expenditure flows, rather than loan stocks; (2) using mortality and capital stock data that relate to the same administrative units (urban districts), and (3) studying the period 1880?1909 as well as the earlier period from 1845. The stock of sewerage capital was robustly related to improvements in all-cause mortality after 1880. The size of this effect varied with the extent of public investment in water supplies, suggesting complementarity between the two assets. For the period 1845?84, investments in water were associated with declines in infant and child mortality but the effect was much smaller and less precisely estimated in later decades. Our results suggest that improvements in water and sewerage targeted different transmission pathways for faecal?oral diseases.";2023;New perspectives on the contribution of sanitary investments to mortality decline in English cities, 1845–1909;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

We develop a generic algorithmic work flow that converts scans of them into geo- and status-referenced household-level data sets. Applying the work flow to our case study, the Berlin 1880 directory, adds idiosyncratic challenges that should make automation less attractive. Yet, employing an administrative benchmark data set on household counts, incomes, and income distributions across more than 200 census tracts, we show that semi-automatic referencing yields results very similar to those from labour-intensive manual referencing. Finally, we discuss how to scale the work flow to other years and cities as well as potential applications in economic history and beyond.;2023;Perks and pitfalls of city directories as a micro-geographic data source;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Berkes, Enrico; Karger, Ezra; Nencka, Peter";Researchers use microdata to study the economic development of the United States and the causal effects of historical policies. Much of this research focuses on county- and state-level patterns and policies because comprehensive sub-county data is not consistently available. We describe a new method that geocodes and standardizes the towns and cities of residence for individuals and households in decennial census microdata from 1790–1940. We release public crosswalks linking individuals and households to consistently-defined place names, longitude-latitude pairs, counties, and states. Our method dramatically increases the number of individuals and households assigned to a sub-county location relative to standard publicly available data: we geocode an average of 83% of the individuals and households in 1790–1940 census microdata, compared to 23% in widely-used crosswalks. In years with individual-level microdata (1850–1940), our average match rate is 94% relative to 33% in widely-used crosswalks. To illustrate the value of our crosswalks, we measure place-level population growth across the United States between 1870 and 1940 at a sub-county level, confirming predictions of Zipf’s Law and Gibrat’s Law for large cities but rejecting similar predictions for small towns.

Bertazzini, Mattia C.;What effect did the settlement of European farmers have on the indigenous agricultural sector during the colonial period? On the one hand, European immigrants imported skills and capital but, on the other, they took control of local resources. By looking at the short-term effect of Italian farming in colonial Libya, I shed new light on this question. Through regression analysis on a novel village dataset covering the entire country, I show that, in 1939, proximity to Italian farms was associated with significantly lower land productivity relative to distant locations. Lower yields can be explained by the adoption of land-extensive cultivation techniques, implemented by indigenous farmers to counteract a labour drain operated by Italian farms through factor markets. The combined mitigating effect of monetary wages and land-extensive farming only partially compensated for the fall in income linked to reduced land productivity.;2023;The effect of settler farming on indigenous agriculture: Evidence from Italian Libya;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Blomqvist, Christopher; Enflo, Kerstin; Jakobsson, Andreas; Åström, Kalle";We describe a deep learning method to read hand-written records from the 16th century. The method consists of a combination of a segmentation module and a Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) module. The transformer-based HTR module exploits both language and image features in reading, classifying and extracting the position of each word on the page. The method is demonstrated on a unique historical document: The Swedish Wealth Tax of 1571. Results suggest that the segmentation module performs significantly better than the lay-out analysis implemented in state-of-the art programs, enabling us to trace many more text blocks correctly on each page. The HTR module has a low character error rate (CER), in addition to being able to classify words and help organize them into tabular formats. By demonstrating an automated process to transform loosely structured handwritten information from the 16th century into organized tables, our method should interest economic historians seeking to digitize and organize quantitative material from pre-industrial periods.;2023;Reading the ransom: Methodological advancements in extracting the Swedish Wealth Tax of 1571;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Bosma, Ulbe; van Leeuwen, Bas";Since colonial times, substantial regional income disparities have been reported for Indonesia. However, in spite of a wide variety of available data and indicators, so far published data on Indonesian per capita GDP in colonial times are limited to macro-estimates for the entire archipelago or are confined either to Java or to the Outer Islands. In this paper we provide a first attempt to arrive at estimates of diverging income and living standards at a regional level. We implement the Geary and Stark method on a large body of data collected by the colonial government, to estimate GDP for ten macro-regions and five benchmark years between 1870 and 1930. Our findings, corrected for prices, confirm the image arising from the existing literature of major divergences within the Indonesian archipelago in general, and of a higher per capita GDP in most of the Outer Islands (all islands of the Indonesian archipelago except for Java and Madura) compared with Java in particular. This was definitely the case in 1870 and still the case in 1920, but the picture is less clear for 1930, which was the final year before Indonesia’s commodity exports started to collapse.;2023;Regional variation in the GDP per capita of colonial Indonesia, 1870–1930;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Bovenkerk, Henning; Fertig, Christine";Abstract Existing scholarship on the early modern consumer revolution postulates a dichotomy between the classic pioneering countries of England and the Netherlands and the remaining parts of Europe, which were more stagnant. We contribute to this literature by analysing probate inventories in a rural area in north-western Germany. We show that a closer look at these spaces, which had an intermediate level of development and integration into global markets, reveals a more gradual development and a discernible market evolution. Sumptuary laws may have somewhat slowed down the change in material culture in German regions, but the presence of towns and the proximity to the Netherlands had noticeably positive effects on consumer behaviour. The proto-industrial orientation of local economies proved to be particularly important, as it led to the granting of access to global markets, in addition to greater availability of cash. We observe a delayed diffusion of the new consumer culture in intermediate European regions and argue for a more gradual view of the European consumer revolution.;2023;Consumer revolution in north-western Germany: Material culture, global goods, and proto-industry in rural households in the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

I found that whether a mother was economically independent and had an income similar to that of the father during her children’s late childhood and adolescence positively associated with upward mobility. The results show a substantial association of mother’s income position to their daughters’ mobility, but not for sons’. Among the primary mechanisms, I argue that extra resources from mothers helped human capital investment through education and that mothers influenced daughters by a gendered role model.;2023;Materfamilias : the association of mother’s work on children’s absolute income mobility, Southern Sweden (1947–2015);European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Bromhead, Alan de; Jordan, David; Kennedy, Francis; Seddon, Jack";Abstract When and why did Sterling Area countries stop holding sterling as the majority of their foreign exchange reserves? This paper takes a comparative approach to examine the relative importance of various determinants of adherence to sterling in its declining years as an international currency. Using an original cross-national panel dataset covering the period 1965?79, we conduct survival analysis which systematically evaluates a comprehensive set of economic and political factors, at the country level as well as in international relations, about when and why countries chose to diversify their reserves away from sterling. Our results highlight the significance of international transactional factors in influencing adherence to sterling, while the effects of British geopolitical retrenchment, Commonwealth cultural ties, and distributional issues were more ambiguous and sensitive to local conditions. We also find that domestic political and historical factors, such as democracy and imperial legacy, played a role in sterling's international unravelling. Finally, we use our results to examine the experience of individual sterling countries and their decisions to diversify.;2023;Sterling's farewell symphony: The end of the Sterling Area revisited;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Chilosi, David; Federico, Giovanni; Tena-Junguito, Antonio";By analyzing a new dataset of terms of trade covering the whole world during the “first globalization” (1800–1913), this article finds that trends of terms of trade varied significantly, both within the periphery and the core, and were mainly driven by import prices. Volatility declined because price spikes became less frequent and export prices became increasingly stable. We find little evidence of de-industrialization. Consistent with our trends, prices of primary products, similarly to those of manufactures, were falling and so was their volatility. These results sit uneasily with the view that terms of trade played a crucial role in holding back the development of peripheral countries before World War I.;2023;Terms of trade during the first globalization: new evidence, new results;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Cilliers, Jeanne; Green, Erik; Ross, Robert";European settler colonies are often thought to have been characterised by a continued expansion of the landed frontier, which impacted the distribution of wealth across their settler populations. Hampered by a lack of data, few studies have been able to study this in depth. How does settlement timing affect wealth and wealth accumulation when frontier expansion is not a smooth, continuous process? Was it the case that pioneers reaped greater economic benefits from locating their farms on superior land, or would they be disadvantaged compared with later arrivals owing to limited infrastructure or greater risk of conflict with indigenous populations? In this paper, we use a unique dataset that allows us to analyse the link between time of arrival and wealth accumulation in a colonial agrarian frontier society: the Graaff-Reinet district in South Africa's Cape Colony between 1786 and 1850. We find that those who arrived early located their farms in the more climatologically suitable areas of the district and utilised their superior lands to accumulate wealth more quickly than latecomers. However, owing to institutional changes that favoured later British arrivals, we also show that the existence of an early-arrival premium did not mean persistence in land ownership.;2023;Did it pay to be a pioneer?

"Cioni, Martina; Federico, Giovanni; Vasta, Michelangelo";A recent stream of literature argues that economic history is expanding its aim of looking for the historical roots of current outcomes (persistence studies) and that it is increasingly integrating with economics. This paper tests these claims with a new database of about 2500 articles published from 2001 to 2018 in the top five economic history journals and in eight leading economics journals. Our results do not confirm this optimistic narrative. Despite a growing interest by economists, economic history and a fortiori persistence studies are still marginal in economics journals. Furthermore, substantial differences between articles in the two groups of outlets are visible. Only a few authors have published in both economics and economic history journals. Publishing in the top five economics journals yields more citations than in top-field journals, but this is not necessarily true for other prestigious economics journals.;2023;Is economic history changing its nature?

"Correia, Sergio; Luck, Stephan";This paper discusses how to successfully digitize large-scale historical micro-data by augmenting optical character recognition (OCR) engines with pre- and post-processing methods. Although OCR software has improved dramatically in recent years due to improvements in machine learning, off-the-shelf OCR applications still present high error rates which limit their applications for accurate extraction of structured information. Complementing OCR with additional methods can however dramatically increase its success rate, making it a powerful and cost-efficient tool for economic historians. This paper showcases these methods and explains why they are useful. We apply them against two large balance sheet datasets and introduce quipucamayoc, a Python package containing these methods in a unified framework.;2023;Digitizing historical balance sheet data: A practitioner’s guide;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Dahl, Christian M.; Johansen, Torben S.D.; Sørensen, Emil N.; Wittrock, Simon";Methods for linking individuals across historical data sets, typically in combination with AI based transcription models, are developing rapidly. Perhaps the single most important identifier for linking is personal names. However, personal names are prone to enumeration and transcription errors and although modern linking methods are designed to handle such challenges, these sources of errors are critical and should be minimized. For this purpose, improved transcription methods and large-scale databases are crucial components. This paper describes and provides documentation for HANA, a newly constructed large-scale database which consists of more than 3.3 million names. The database contains more than 105 thousand unique names with a total of more than 1.1 million images of personal names, which proves useful for transfer learning to other settings. We provide three examples hereof, obtaining significantly improved transcription accuracy on both Danish and US census data. In addition, we present benchmark results for deep learning models automatically transcribing the personal names from the scanned documents. Through making more challenging large-scale databases publicly available we hope to foster more sophisticated, accurate, and robust models for handwritten text recognition.;2023;HANA: A handwritten name database for offline handwritten text recognition;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Dribe, Martin; Eriksson, Björn; Helgertz, Jonas";We examine selection by class origin and gender in the emigration from Sweden to the United States during the age of mass migration. We use full-count census data linked to emigration lists to create a panel of over one million men and women. Class selection was similar for men and women, with children from medium-skilled backgrounds being most likely to leave. Selection on class origin was most pronounced in poorer and less industrialized regions, but similar in rural and urban areas. These patterns suggest that not only returns to skill determined migrant selection but also class-specific costs of migration.;2023;From Sweden to America: migrant selection in the transatlantic migration, 1890–1910;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Edo, Anthony; Melitz, Jacques";The scale of the rise in personal wealth following the Black Death calls the life-cycle hypothesis of consumption into consideration. Based on price level evidence, this paper shows for the first time that the wealth effect of the Black Death on economic activity continued in England for generations, up to 1450. Indeed, in the absence of consideration of the wealth effect, other influences on the price level do not even appear in the econometric analysis. The shift in tastes toward higher quality goods, luxuries and imports stemming from the per capita windfall for the survivors in the mid-fourteenth century plays a substantial part in the analysis. So does England’s little influence on the relative prices of its imports relative to home goods. The separate effects of coinage, population, trade, wages and annual number of days worked for wages on the price level all also receive major attention and new results follow for adjustment in the labor market.;2023;Wealth and shifting demand pressures on the price level in England after the Black Death;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

This integration is more marked in North America than in Europe because North American economic historians are more likely to be trained in the discipline of economics. In contrast, a significant share of scholars in Europe are trained in the discipline of economic history.

Ferraz, Ricardo;In this paper, I show that the Portuguese budgetary costs with the First World War represented, on average, practically 50% of state expenditure and 7% of GDP during 1914–1918. These costs caused different negative effects on public finances and were also negatively correlated with economic growth according to the estimated results of two dynamic models. Nevertheless, Portugal’s costs with this war appear to have been lower than those of the other belligerents for which data are available, as Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, France, Greece, Great Britain, Italy, and the United States.;2023;The Portuguese budgetary costs with First World War: a comparative perspective;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Fourie, Johan; Garmon Jr, Frank";Europeans at the end of the eighteenth century had settled across the globe, from North and South America to Australia to the southern tip of Africa. While theories of institutional persistence explain the ?reversal of fortunes? between settled and unsettled regions, few studies consider the large differences in early living standards between settler societies. This paper uses newly transcribed household-level tax censuses from the Dutch and British Cape Colony and the United States shortly after independence to show comparative levels of income and wealth over four decades both between the two regions and within them. Cape farmers were, on average, more affluent than their American counterparts. While crop output and livestock were more unequally distributed at the Cape, ownership of enslaved people in America was more unequal. There was little indication of an imminent reversal of fortunes.;2023;The settlers’ fortunes: Comparing tax censuses in the Cape Colony and early American republic;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Fuentes-Vásquez, María José; España-Eljaiek, Irina";In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, coffee became the main Colombian export, turning the country into one of the world’s leading coffee producers. This agrarian commodity provided resources for coffee-growing areas, favouring the rise of mass education. However, this paper suggests that coffee led to children ceasing to attend school to work in coffee production, thus affecting the demand for education adversely. We test this hypothesis by using different empirical strategies. We conduct panel regressions and instrumental variable cross-sectional estimates. The results show that increasing coffee production negatively affects the demand for the education of primary school-age children.;2023;Coffee tastes bitter: education and the coffee economy in Colombia in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Galofré Vilà, Gregori;I study the link between monetary policy and electoral outcomes by linking new data on the 1923 German hyperinflation and the vote share of the main parties of Weimar Republic from 1924 to 1933. Exploiting cross-sectional variation in prices in over 280 cities, I find that inflation predicts the vote share of the Volksrechtspartei, an association-turned-party of inflation victims, and positively correlates with the Communists in the 1932 elections. Hyperinflation also leads to a decline in turnout, with a loss of confidence in the German institutions. However, contrary to received wisdom, areas more affected by inflation did not see a higher vote share for the Nazi party. Results are robust to a range of specifications, including models in differences, panel data with fixed effects, Coarsened Exact Matching estimation, Conley standard errors, and an instrumental variable strategy.;2023;Spoils of War: The Political Legacy of the German hyperinflation;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Geloso, Vincent;A long-standing item of interest in Canadian economic history is the “agricultural crisis” that apparently plagued the large colony of Quebec during the first half of the nineteenth century. One particularly resilient explanation of the crisis claims that cultural conservatism made the colony’s French-Canadian population reluctant to embrace modern farming techniques developed in Britain and the US. This has been supported through comparisons with the English farmers in the colony. Using data from the census of Quebec in 1851, this paper shows that there was no such reluctance. French-Canadian farmers were no less likely to adopt “scientific” farming techniques than English-Canadian farmers in the region.;2023;Unenlightened peasants?

Gómez-i-Aznar, Èric;This work provides data on human capital for the Guarani Jesuit missions during the eighteenth century. Based on the age heaping methodology, the results of a large sample (over 3600 observations) suggest that the knowledge of numerical skills in these missions was exceptional. A comparison with other regions and locations with different institutional frameworks, religious or otherwise, or led by other religious orders, confirms the exceptionality of the Guarani Jesuit missions. The model of these missions, based on productive self-sufficiency and egalitarian and cohesive social organisation, as well as respect for the pre-existing culture exemplified by their Guaranisation and adaptation to the Guarani world view and language, could explain their successful educational performance and the intergenerational transmission of human capital beyond the disappearance of the Jesuit missions after 1767.;2023;Ad maiorem Dei gloriam: Numeracy levels in the Guarani Jesuit missions;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

"Hautcoeur, Pierre-Cyrille; Rezaee, Amir; Riva, Angelo";"We study two regulatory changes that affected competition between the transparent Parquet and the OTC-like Coulisse markets in Paris at the turn of the twentieth century. The two reforms determined three regimes of competition—illegal competition, free competition, and enforced monopoly. After documenting institutional changes and their political economy, we show that the Paris market touch (i.e., the average spread of securities traded in the two markets) widened under the free competition regime but narrowed under the enforced monopoly regime to a size much smaller than during the first. These results accord with recent literature that questions the effects of competition between transparent and opaque markets; a transparent monopoly might be more effective than competition if the latter involves opaque markets.";2023;Competition between securities markets: stock exchange industry regulation in the Paris financial center at the turn of the twentieth century;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Insa-Sánchez, Pau; Díez-Minguela, Alfonso";The development of modern educational systems radically altered the way knowledge and skills were transmitted. Yet, while elementary schooling rapidly expanded in late 19th and early twentieth centuries, secondary education struggled to find its way. This was also the case in Spain where, despite a growing demand, the provision of public secondary education during the second half of the 19th century was rather limited. As a result, private education, and especially that promoted by the Church, rushed to fill in the gap. Using a new database with municipal-level data, we examine what drove the expansion of private schools. As expected, demand-pull factors were critical. Still, the interplay between local forces and private agents should not be overlooked, especially as the State lacked the financial muscle and political will to broaden access to secondary education, whereas the Church was searching for a niche from which to consolidate its position in the nascent liberal society.;2023;Starting high school?

"Ivanov, Martin; Kopsidis, Michael";In Bulgaria the share of secondary production in GDP remained constantly low between c. 1870?1910. To explain the country's exceptionally weak growth, we use endogenous and unified growth theory. Gerschenkron and Palairet blame a self-sufficiency-oriented peasant economy for rising labour and raw material costs in industry, which destroyed the competitiveness of Bulgarian manufacturing and prevented industrialisation. We refute the existence of any long-lasting cost increases in industry after 1878. Quite the opposite was true: the expansion of Bulgaria's secondary sector was restricted by detrimental changes on the demand side, for which peasants were not responsible. Recent research claims that, around 1910, Bulgarian textile production was significantly lower than in 1870. Our study brings to light new data and information that clearly disproves this view. Until around 1910, a booming modern manufacturing sector more than replaced the country's proto-industries? textile outputs, which had plummeted dramatically during the early years of the newly founded Bulgarian state. However, as the rise of modern manufacturing in textile production coincided with the decline of the entire large sector of traditional manufacturing, secondary production as a whole stagnated.;2023;Industrialisation in a small grain economy during the First Globalisation: Bulgaria c. 1870–1910;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Jacks, David S.; Pendakur, Krishna; Shigeoka, Hitoshi";Federal prohibition was one of the most ambitious policy interventions in US history. However, the removal of restrictions on alcohol after 1933 was not uniform. Using a new balanced panel on annual deaths, we find that city-level repeal is associated with a 11.6% decrease in the rate of death by non-automobile accidents, a category which critically include accidental poisonings. We relate this finding to a large literature which emphasizes – but never precisely quantifies – the mortality effects of adulterated alcohol during federal prohibition. Thus, repeal likely led to a large annual reduction in accidental poisonings. However, combined with previous results showing even larger increases in infant mortality, repeal nonetheless likely had negative contemporaneous effects on public health.;2023;Urban mortality and the repeal of federal prohibition;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
James, Harold;"The paper examines the causal relationships and interdependence between inflation and globalisation over centuries: in the sixteenth century, in the age of Spanish silver; then in the first age of modern globalisation from in the middle of the nineteenth century; and finally in the new globalisation that took off in the 1970s. In the latter cases, inflation was a response to a negative supply shock, and eventually generated policy decisions on economic opening. Both recent globalisations may be explained as technologically driven, and some of the most important productivity gains involved the cost of transport, but the fundamental innovations substantially pre-dated the moment at which they were economically transformative. Scarcity dramatically changes relative prices, but not the overall price level. Initially inflation became a policy solution, an attractive way of meeting the challenges of scarcity, but then its increasing costs became apparent, and more, rather than less, global integration looked like a way of reducing costs and minimising social pressure. Policy choices were involved in generating the globalised world: not only the removal of impediments to commerce, but also a consensus around a stable and internationally applicable monetary framework, whether the gold standard in the late nineteenth century or a modern inflation targeting regime in the late twentieth century.";2023;Inflation and globalisation: The Tawney Lecture 2022;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Our tests support the theory; maturity structures mattered most in a regime of falling prices, with vulnerable shorter-term customer loans and bank liabilities representing the most consistent cause of bank distress in the crisis. Similarly, stronger growth in (1) leverage, (2) weaker collateral loans, and (3) foreign borrowing during the boom were all associated with bank failure.";2023;The highs and the lows: bank failures in Sweden through inflation and deflation, 1914–1926;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Kisling, Wilfried;The role of finance in the development of trade draws increasing attention from economists and economic historians. Yet empirical studies, especially from an historical perspective, continue to be scarce. This study analyses the role of German and British foreign banks in the internationalisation of trade during the first globalisation. It creates a novel data set on the bilateral trade of Germany and Great Britain with the rest of the world and the number and geographical distribution of German and British foreign banks between 1881 and 1913. Using an augmented gravity model of trade, the article shows that banks had a significant positive impact on exports and imports and that this effect was even more pronounced in case of German banks and trade. Moreover, the effect of German banks on trade is the highest in the years closer to bank entry, supporting the idea of German banks being initiators of trade. In contrast, the effect of British banks seems constant over time.;2023;‘Los von London’: A comparative, empirical analysis of German and British global foreign banking and trade development, 1881–1913;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Kukić, Leonard;Nation-building is often proposed as a device for integration in ethnically divided societies. The determinants of national sentiment, however, remain imperfectly understood. This paper analyses the role of interethnic contact in the process of nation formation within multiethnic Yugoslavia, just before its disintegration in 1991. Using a variety of data sources and empirical strategies, I find that interethnic contact stimulated the formation of the Yugoslav nation. I argue that ethnic intermarriage is the key mechanism through which ethnic diversity influenced the adoption of a shared Yugoslav identity. These results illustrate the powerful effect that interethnic contact can have in reducing ethnic division even in a tense ethnic environment on the verge of conflict, like that of Yugoslavia.;2023;The last Yugoslavs: Ethnic diversity and national identity;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

Recently, the EMP has been reappraised with regard to economic fluctuations. However, suspected positive mechanisms are backed by little evidence.

Combined with marriage contracts (systematic in this written-law area), we control for wealth, Stem household settlement and social status of father and husband for a representative sample of marriages. Studying individual behaviors rather than aggregated values, we clarify the operation of the EMP system: bad economic conditions resulted in later female age at marriage, which had two positive consequences: fewer children, thus adjusting the population level; a smaller age difference between spouses, suggesting greater agency for women within the couple, whereas the existing literature only stressed stable high status for women within the society characterized by the EMP.

"Lefebvre, Mathieu; Pestieau, Pierre; Ponthiere, Gregory";Under income-differentiated mortality, poverty measures suffer from a selection bias: they do not count the missing poor (i.e., persons who would have been counted as poor provided they did not die prematurely). The Pre-Industrial period being characterized by an evolutionary advantage (i.e., a higher number of surviving children per household) of the non-poor over the poor, one may expect that the missing poor bias is substantial during that period. This paper quantifies the missing poor bias in Pre-Industrial societies, by computing the hypothetical headcount poverty rates that would have prevailed provided the non-poor did not benefit from an evolutionary advantage over the poor. Using data on Pre-Industrial England and France, we show that the sign and size of the missing poor bias are sensitive to the degree of downward social mobility.;2023;Counting the missing poor in pre-industrial societies;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz

I find that nominal wages changed infrequently but that wage cuts were more common than wage rises on average.

"Maseland, Robbert; Spruk, Rok";This paper quantifies the economic benefits of joining the USA. Adapting extant static synthetic control models into a dynamic model similar to Arellano and Bond (Rev Econ Stud 58(2):277–297, 1991), we are able to construct the counterfactual growth paths of Texas, California, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Wyoming and Nevada had they not joined the USA. We show that the real growth path outperforms the counterfactuals substantially in all cases. In the same way, we construct counterfactual growth paths of Puerto Rico, Cuba, the Philippines and Greenland in the scenario where they joined the USA at times in history where this might have been a (remote) possibility. We find counterfactual growth to be substantially higher than the actual growth. Having established the positive economic effects of US membership, we subsequently assess the sources of this added growth, distinguishing between a class of explanations related to internal market access and a class of explanations related to institutional quality. Using a large number of determinants of institutional quality, we find that the institutional quality of the USA as a whole matches the quality predicted for New England most closely. This suggests that upon accession, states imported the institutional quality of New England, which was typically superior to what they would have likely developed by themselves. We show that this institutional bonus accounts for the bulk of the growth benefits of US accession. While we warn against interpreting our results as evidence for the superiority of US culture or institutions in any way, our empirical findings indicate large historical growth and institutional benefits of US statehood.;2023;The benefits of US statehood: an analysis of the growth effects of joining the USA;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Mijatović, Boško; Zavadjil, Milan";"Given the scanty and inadequate studies on Serbia's growth performance before the First World War, this paper presents production-side GDP estimates for Serbia for six years between 1867 and 1910. It probes into the growth dynamics, assessing convergence with the more developed countries of north-western Europe, as well as progress towards achieving modern economic growth. Although the economy showed some dynamism in terms of overall GDP, per capita GDP in pre-First World War Serbia grew by only 0.28 per cent per annum, as much of the overall GDP growth was eroded by rapid population growth. Far from converging with north-western Europe, Serbia continued to fall behind. Sluggish structural transformation and slow income per capita growth suggest that Serbia's transition to modern economic growth was in its infancy. Growth in the dominant agricultural sector was extensive, driven by expanding arable land and population growth. Land was affordable and easy to obtain; hence, peasants invested little in new technologies. Meanwhile, the modern industrial and service sectors were below a threshold that could sustain rapid growth. Nevertheless, this study also highlights the rapid expansion of a small modern sector and export diversification that reflected emergent ?green shoots? in 1905?10.";2023;Serbia on the path to modern economic growth;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Molinder, Jakob; Pihl, Christopher";We use a unique source from the Swedish royal demesnes to examine the work and relative wages of women in sixteenth-century Sweden, an economic laggard in the early modern period. The source pertains to workers hired on yearly contracts, a type more representative of historical labour markets than day labour on large construction sites, and this allows us to observe directly the food consumed by workers. We speak to the debate on the ?little divergence? within Europe, as women's work and gender differentials in pay is a key indicator of women's relative autonomy and seen as a cause for the economic ascendency of the North Sea region during the period. We find small gender differentials among both unskilled and skilled workers, indicating that Sweden was a part of the ?golden age? for women. We argue that despite superficial equality, women's economic outlooks were restrained in many other ways ? including their access to higher-skilled work and jobs in the expanding parts of the economy ? adding important nuance to the discussion about the relationship between women's social position and economic growth in the early modern period.;2023;Women's work and wages in the sixteenth century and Sweden's position in the ‘little divergence’;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"O'Brien, Patrick K.; Palma, Nuno";From its foundation as a private corporation in 1694, the Bank of England extended large amounts of credit to support the British private economy and to support an increasingly centralised British state. The Bank helped the British state reach a position of geopolitical and economic hegemony in the international economic order. In this paper, we deploy recalibrated financial data to analyse an evolving trajectory of connections between the British economy, the state, and the Bank of England. We show how these connections contributed to form an effective and efficient fiscal?naval state and promote the development of a system of financial intermediation for the economy. This symbiotic relationship became stronger after 1793. The evidence that we consider here shows that although the Bank was nominally a private institution and profits were paid to its shareholders, it was playing a public role well before Bagehot's doctrine.;2023;Not an ordinary bank but a great engine of state: The Bank of England and the British economy, 1694–1844;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Ostermeyer, Vinzent;In the shadow of industry, the service sector substantially expanded during the late nineteenth century. This paper analyzes how the creation of industrial employment contributed to this growth of services. I leverage full-count census data from the United States, Great Britain, and Sweden to estimate local employment multipliers. I show that industrial growth was a key driver in the emergence of services. Each new industrial job created up to one additional local service job. This effect was driven by the high-skilled industrial sector where each additional job created up to two service jobs. Multiplier effects created jobs across different services.;2023;Local multipliers and the growth of services: evidence from late nineteenth century USA, Great Britain, and Sweden;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Otojanov, Ravshonbek; Fouquet, Roger; Granville, Brigitte";Using historical data for the 1700?1914 period, this paper analyses the nature and direction of technical change in Britain. The evidence in this paper indicates that, over this long period, labour-saving technology adoption was a major response to changes in relative factor prices, thus supporting the hypothesis that ?induced innovation? was a major driver of technical change during the British industrial revolution. Labour saving was made possible and sustained by capital-augmenting and energy-augmenting technical change coupled with continuous capital accumulation and abundant energy supplies. This process placed the British economy on a higher capital?labour ratio equilibrium, and was the primary force driving sustained productivity growth, which further raised wages and living standards.;2023;Factor prices and induced technical change in the industrial revolution;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Palacios-Mateo, Adrian;In this paper, I use a unique micro-database of 254,000 individuals distributed in 12 Spanish mining municipalities to explore the households’ decision-making processes regarding their children’s education. This database covers individuals living in municipalities in Asturias, Cantabria, the Basque Country, Huelva, Almería, and Murcia from 1877 to 1924. Focusing on around 42,000 children between eight and 18 years old, the findings show that living standards were a key component of human capital formation. Children in working-class families had considerably lower literacy levels than the offspring of upper- and middle-class families. Moreover, the analysis shows that there was a significantly greater gender gap among mining families working in open-pit mines than among other working-class families or those of underground miners. This difference lowered the wages of open-pit mining families which translated into a higher burden for daughters, hampering their human capital formation.;2023;Education and household decision-making in Spanish mining communities, 1877–1924;Cliometrica;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Palma, Nuno; REIS, JAIME; Rodrigues, Lisbeth";Gender discrimination has been pointed out as a determining factor behind the long-run divergence in incomes of Southern vis-à-vis Northwestern Europe. In this paper, we show that women in Portugal were not historically more discriminated against than those in other parts of Western Europe, including England and the Netherlands. We rely on a new dataset of thousands of observations from archival sources covering six centuries, and we complement it with a qualitative discussion of comparative social norms. Compared with Northwestern Europe, women in Portugal faced similar gender wage gaps, married at similar ages, and did not face more restrictions on labor market participation. Consequently, other factors must have been responsible for the Little Divergence of Western European incomes.;2023;Historical gender discrimination does not explain comparative Western European development: evidence from Portugal, 1300-1900;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Palsson, Craig;Refugee camps are sudden, spontaneous population centers that can persist for years. Their persistence provides an opportunity to learn about the forces of path dependence. I argue that residents stay because the camps create local amenities. I examine this question using refugee camps established in Haiti after a 1937 massacre in the Dominican Republic. Despite the residents’ freedom to migrate, the camps evolved into persistent settlements where the refugees’ descendants resided 70 years later. I show that these camps gave residents access to public land with incomplete rights and to social networks that help with informal insurance. While residents 70 years later have slightly lower levels of literacy, they are not significantly disadvantaged on other margins. I interpret these results as evidence of path dependence driven by amenities rather than local productivity advantages.;2023;The forces of path dependence: Haiti's refugee camps, 1937–2009;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Peters, Margaret E.;After the Black Death, serfdom disappeared in Western Europe while making a resurgence in Eastern Europe. What explains this difference? I argue that serfdom was against the interests of the sovereign and was only imposed when the nobility, who needed serfdom to maintain their economic and political standing, had leverage to impose their will. The nobility gained this power through financing the state. Using data from the fourteenth through the eighteenth centuries, I show that serfdom was imposed and strengthened in areas where sovereigns had few other resources to finance the state.;2023;Government finance and imposition of serfdom after the Black Death;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Postel, Hannah M.;This paper proposes a novel pre-processing technique to improve record linkage for historical Chinese populations. Current matching approaches are relatively ineffective due to Chinese-specific naming conventions and enumeration errors. This paper develops a three-step process that both triples the match rate over baseline and improves match accuracy. The procedures developed in this paper can be applied in part or in full to other sources of historical data, and/or modified for use with other character-based languages such as Japanese. More broadly, this approach suggests the promise of language-specific linkage procedures to boost match rates for ethnic minority groups.;2023;Record linkage for character-based surnames: Evidence from chinese exclusion;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Rognes, Asa Malmstrom; Schenk, Catherine R.";"Currency boards have had an enduring attraction as a solution to exchange rate and monetary credibility for small open economies, despite few successful examples. In this context, the case of Hong Kong stands out for its longevity; it survived the handover to China, the Asian financial crises in 1997, and the global crises in 2007?8 and 2020. The 1983 currency crisis and the decision to link the exchange rate to the US$ is usually treated as an outcome of local political uncertainty due to the Sino-British negotiations which set the framework for how Hong Kong would fit with the rest of China after 1997. We present fresh archival evidence from Hong Kong and London to reveal the year-long debates over Hong Kong's monetary system after a drop in the exchange rate in September 1982 and to demonstrate how most of the protagonists in Hong Kong and London came only reluctantly to accept the idea of re-pegging the dollar once public expectations had been raised. We also show how the mixture of currency and banking instability affected the terms of the negotiations in 1982 and 1983 and set the framework for the one country, two currencies system that prevails today.";2023;One country, two currencies: The adoption of the Hong Kong currency board, 1983;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Rouanet, Louis;War necessitates both allocating real resources to defense and certain interest groups being in favor of the government raising resources to wage war. Price controls can be a tool for governments to mobilize additional resources while buying the support of certain key interest groups, hence making war politically viable. France during the revolutionary Terror, the first instance of widespread price controls used in times of war, is used to illustrate this hypothesis. Urban capitalists benefited from price controls on agricultural output combined with forced sales. At the same time, I estimate that in the six months preceding the abolition of price controls, the government saved, by using them (and in real terms), the equivalent of roughly 40% of the annual 1790 central government budget. Consistent with my theory, once the exigencies of the war attenuated and as collective action became more costly for the urban population, price controls were abandoned.;2023;Foutu maximum: The political economy of price controls and national defense in revolutionary France;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"RUTTERFORD, JANETTE; SOTIROPOULOS, DIMITRIS P.; van LIESHOUT, CARRY";After the introduction of limited liability, a growing number of individuals in Britain from a widening social spectrum, including the less affluent, began to own stocks and shares. Drawing upon a unique and large dataset of 35 848 investors between 1870 and 1935, this study analyses joint holdings which have been a neglected aspect of investor behaviour. Our findings reveal that joint holdings were quite common and that about one in five UK investors were involved in a joint investment. Men were more likely to be joint holders than women for reasons related to institutions of social ownership such as trusts and executorships.;2023;Individual investors and social ownership structures in the UK before the 1930s: Joint holdings and trustee investment;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Ryckbosch, Wouter; Saelens, Wout";What was the role of energy in shaping modern economies and fuelling the transition to sustained economic growth? In the historiography on the industrial revolution, the transition to fossil energy carriers plays a central role. Despite recent efforts to gather new empirical evidence, long-term comparative studies on energy transitions and their economic impact before and during the first industrial revolution remain rare. As a contribution to this literature, this article presents new quantitative data on energy consumption from the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries in the Low Countries. To explore differences in the chronology and impact of energy transitions, we compare the total levels of energy consumption, the energy mix, and the prices of fuels between two cities in the northern and southern Low Countries: Leiden and Ghent. This analysis enables us to explore more clearly which factors played a key role in the interaction between energy, economic growth, and industrialisation. The transition towards a cheap-energy economy in Holland was associated with economic growth, but not with mechanisation. On the other hand, the rapid mechanisation process in Ghent was associated not with a cheap-energy economy (relative to that of Leiden), but more specifically with a cheap-coal economy.;2023;Fuelling the urban economy: A comparative study of energy in the Low Countries, 1600–1850;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Seegmiller, Bryan; Papanikolaou, Dimitris; Schmidt, Lawrence D.W.";"We detail a methodology for estimating the textual similarity between two documents while accounting for the possibility that two different words can have a similar meaning. We illustrate the method’s usefulness in facilitating comparisons between documents with very different formats and vocabularies by textually linking occupation task and industry output descriptions with related technologies as described in patent texts; we also examine economic applications of the resultant document similarity measures. In a final application we demonstrate that the method also works well relative to alternatives for comparing documents within the same domain by showing that pairwise textual similarity between occupations’ task descriptions strongly predicts the probability that a given worker will transition from one occupation to another. Finally, we offer some suggestions on other potential uses and guidance in implementing the method.";2023;Measuring document similarity with weighted averages of word embeddings;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"SOTIROPOULOS, DIMITRIS P.; RUTTERFORD, JANETTE; Tori, Daniele; Kyparissis, Antonis";This study investigates the portfolio asset allocation of UK investment trusts between 1914 and 1928 using a unique hand-collected dataset of 41 companies, which comprises 40,875 portfolio holdings. UK investment trusts not only survived WWI without major losses but also had a remarkable performance in the 1920s, which led to a wave of new incorporations. The 1920s was a period of significant shifts in investment trust portfolio composition and our analysis examines the main reasons for this. We show that investment trust managers were able to adjust quickly to the new socioeconomic circumstances and secure high profitability for their shareholders.;2023;Fund management in the interwar period: UK investment trust portfolio asset allocation in the 1920s;European Review of Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Travieso, Emiliano;"This article examines the economics of innovation in livestock rearing during the first globalisation in Uruguay, the country with the most cattle per person in the world, both then and now. Using a new historical dataset of Uruguayan agriculture, the first one at a sub-provincial level, I exploit regional differences in the adoption of cattle crossbreeding ? the genetic improvement of local herds through hybridisation with foreign breeds. Contrary to traditional historiographical claims, I find that this innovation was not primarily explained by the location of enlightened elites (European or local) or by the scale of productive units (i.e. latifundia); rather, rural producers invested in crossbreeding wherever their local landscapes and previous productive choices encouraged it. While it affected biological processes that spanned several agricultural calendars, and thereby developed more slowly than innovations in crop farming, technical change in Uruguayan ranching was also environmentally sensitive, largely scale-neutral, congruent with previous agricultural patterns, and hinged on a widespread response from producers.";2023;Soils, scale, or elites?

Udale, Charles;We know the policy of quarantining plague victims and their families together within their households entailed considerable costs and controversy in early modern Europe. Less clear is the extent to which the authorities implemented the policy in the face of this. This paper presents a novel approach to the measurement of enforcement which relies on linking deceased individuals listed in parish registers into household groups and then measuring changes in within-household mortality between parishes and epidemics. This provides a more complete assessment of the scale of implementation than would be possible using documentary sources alone. Measuring within-household mortality allows us to understand patterns of quarantine enforcement in settlements across early modern Europe. Here the focus is restricted to three epidemics that occurred in Bristol ? one of England's most populous and prosperous cities. The analysis reveals household quarantine was enforced in 1603?4 with unprecedented vigour. The effects of quarantine are particularly pronounced in the affluent parishes where elite residence was highest. Greater evidence for enforcement is explained by greater elite oversight and control, as well as their desire to protect their own households. The scale of the impact is shocking. Household quarantine could double within household mortality.;2023;Evaluating early modern lockdowns: Household quarantine in Bristol, 1565–1604;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Wakelam, Alexander;This article measures the relationship between marital rates and female economic independence in eighteenth-century England and Wales through an assessment of their confinement in debtors? prisons. While an array of scholarship has emphasised the enduring agency of women who were able to continue managing enterprises after marriage, this has arguably too severely diminished the significance of coverture which eradicated the legal identity of wives. By insisting agency requires the ability to be held accountable not merely in terms of the capacity to act, this research emphasises that, until it was abolished, coverture continued to matter in a practical economic sense and not merely in legal theory. As marriage rates increased, the rate at which women were held accountable for their debts declined, suggesting a proportional limitation of their independence, functioning essentially as their husband's employee. Industrialisation had little impact upon female accountability, suggesting that demography rather than capitalism governed how women engaged with the market. Furthermore, this research highlights a striking shift in how women understood their own identity, increasingly adopting occupational rather than marital descriptions of themselves possibly owing to the increased marginality of singlewomen.;2023;Assessing female accountability in the long eighteenth century through debt imprisonment;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
Ward, J. R.;Early nineteenth-century demographic trends on sugar estates in Jamaica, the most important British Caribbean colony, are examined through the 1817?32 public slave registers. We seek evidence regarding the background to the island's 1831?2 popular insurrection, the immediate cause of the London parliament's vote in 1833 to abolish colonial slavery. Some historians argue that the revolt occurred as ?political? effect from a sudden upsurge of metropolitan anti-slavery activism in 1830?1. They believe the uprising broke out despite improvement in enslaved people's material welfare, favoured by many slaveholders to secure population increase after the closure of the British transatlantic slave trade in 1808. Alternative ?economic? assessments judge that increasing workloads had been aggravating popular unrest before the revolt. Commercial pressures, and the imminent likelihood of emancipation, allegedly outweighed welfare concerns. The excess of slave deaths over births widened between 1817 and 1832. However, the registers show that demographic deficits resulted mainly from the ageing of the last Africa-born cohorts. Jamaica-born enslaved people became self-reproducing. There was no general pre-1831 regime deterioration. Most slaveholders sought to maintain their Jamaican assets for the long term through pro-natalist measures, and did not expect emancipation. The revolt's causes were thus more ?political? than ?economic?.;2023;Demographic trends in late-slavery Jamaica, 1817–32;The Economic History Review;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
"Zwart, Pim de; Soekhradj, Phylicia";This article exploits a unique district-level dataset to investigate the relationship between sugar cultivation, property rights systems and land distribution in colonial Java around the turn of the twentieth century. We demonstrate a negative and statistically significant relationship between sugar cultivation and the landholder Gini. An IV strategy, employing a newly computed index of sugar suitability as instrument, suggests that this effect is causal. It is argued that sugar production in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries stimulated the expansion and persistence of communal landholding. This communal landholding consequently led to more equally distributed plots among landholders in the early twentieth century. We emphasize the importance of local property rights institutions in mitigating the effects of export production on socioeconomic outcomes.;2023;Sweet equality: Sugar, property rights, and land distribution in colonial Java;Explorations in Economic History;Zeitschriftenaufsatz
